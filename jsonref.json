They are so many models from other races black, Asian and so many more she is a role model for many young girls. This photoshoot is an insult to all the beautiful black women.’‘There’s a difference between getting a tan look (most of her pics) to actually changing her pigment to a shade of brown that a tan would never do AKA unnatural AF,’ says another.‘Also her face has been altered SO hard.

I shout it from rooftops. I did it for a week at work for content reasons.But the truth is that in the personal bit of my life, I don’t actually masturbate.I’ve masturbated before, obviously. That in-office session I mentioned, of course. I got quite into it when I was a teenager learning about my body and figuring out my sexuality.But as I moved past 17, the urge to masturbate petered out.Gone were the days of makeshift vibrators and hiding under my duvet with Avril Lavigne playing in the background so my parents wouldn’t hear a soft buzz. Suddenly masturbation wasn’t on my radar.Yes, that’s probably in part due to actually starting to have sex with other people.Once I dated people and realised that they could tick sex off the list, masturbation didn’t have the same urgency.But it wasn’t as simple as ‘if I’m horny, I’ll just text someone for sex’.When I my university relationship turned long-distance, the urge to masturbate didn’t rush back with renewed force. It just didn’t occur to me. I was busy doing things writing essays, spending time with friends, working out how I could make a giant pack of pasta last for the next three months.(Picture: Ella Byworth for )In my downtime I’d watch TV or waste time on the internet – it’s not that I was rejecting masturbation, but that it didn’t even spring to mind as an option.Occasionally my hand would wander south, but only prompted by instruction from the person I was seeing at the time. I’d never touch myself based purely on my own volition. It didn’t really count as masturbation, just sex 4,000 miles apart.When I was single, things stayed the same.It was (and still is) pretty rare for me to randomly be overcome with lust without any prompting. I’ve worked out that my arousal depends very much on another person. I’m not getting off on specific movements, but on the interaction – the bit where someone else decides what they’re going to do, the bit where you feel yourself reacting to their touch, the bit where they react to yours.I gave masturbating a go on my own, conscious of its benefits and committed to feeling the empowerment of giving myself an orgasm.But the experience fell flat. I felt like I didn’t know what I was doing. It was boring.I tried porn. I felt nothing.I tried fantasising, but found myself getting more into plot devices than arousal.30 minutes would go by with nothing to write home about and I’d give up, questioning why I’d wasted my time fiddling with my bits when I just wasn’t feeling it.I tried a few different times, but the same thing happened. It didn’t feel bad, but the pleasure I was getting from it paled in comparison from the joy of watching an episode of the Mindy Project or the relaxation I gained from spending the afternoon baking.Now, as a semi-proper adult, I just don’t bother.I can’t be bothered. I don’t have the time or the urge.(Picture: Ella Byworth for )But the thing is, I feel some shame in admitting that. I feel like being a non-masturbator would make me seem unempowered, sexually inept, or a prude – none of which I am.I’d spent my teens arguing back against the rumours that masturbating was ‘dirty’ or made you a lesbian (no, I don’t get that either), shouting the lessons I’d learned from Cosmo about how it’s brilliant to be able to give yourself sexual pleasure and learn what you like.Now I’ll awkwardly nod along to conversations about wanking, feeling backwards for not having a nightly sesh.I’ve realised that just as there should be no shame in masturbating, there should be no shame in not masturbating, either.I know myself now. I know that my arousal and my pleasure is based in interactions with another person, and that trying to get off totally solo isn’t going to work for me.I can masturbate in front of the person I’m having sex with. That’s great, so clearly I know what I’m doing. But without another person there to react and engage, touching myself does f*** all.I’m busy. I’m tired. My sex drive is low enough as it is without me scrapping sex opportunities for my partner by attempting to deal with horniness on my own.I’ve learned that in terms of pleasure, the non-sexual kind is the one I’m best at giving myself. If I’m stressed, I can go for a run, or talk about stuff, or write it down. If I’m bored, I’ll find something to do.If on the very rare occasion I am wildly turned on, it’s better for me to give my partner a call than try to sort things out on my own, as I’ll only end up frustrated that it’s not doing the trick, or have to dedicate at least an hour to actually get any benefits.Masturbation is a wonderful thing, but if it’s not for you, that’s perfectly alright. It doesn’t mean you’re repressed or entirely un-sexual or incapable of self-care.Sexual empowerment is about finding out what gets you off and being comfortable with it, not pushing yourself to do something because you think you ‘should’. That might be an elaborate self-stroking schedule with candles and background music, or it might be only being interested in physical sex with another person. That’s totally fine.Wank onwards, or don’t, or keep that path open.I’ve learned I can be a loud, proud supporter of masturbation while not personally being wild on it myself.MORE: Men who masturbate often have better sex livesMORE: What it’s like to work at a foot fetish partyMORE: Straight women explain what sex feels like when you have a vagina"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_7927051.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"woman 33 years younger partner shares make age gap relationships work","story":"Rahab and Joe (Picture: RAHAB KIMANI  CATERS NEWS)The general rule for age gaps in relationships goes ‘your age, ided by two, plus seven’.Anything younger than that is deemed ‘unacceptable’ by society.This arbitrary formula would mean Rahab Kimani and her partner Joe Singiser were way out of range to date.That’s because Joe is 54 and Rahab is 21. The pair live in Barnaget, New Jersey.We spoke to Rahab about her relationship with Joe, and how they make it work.(Picture: RAHAB KIMANI  CATERS NEWS)Rahab and Joe met while they were both working as carers at a nursing home, and have now been together for over a year. Rahab told :‘We saw each other all the time and gave each looks but we never really had a full conversation by ourselves. I was getting ready to move to Boston with my sister and someone told me to ask him for big boxes, so I went to his office and asked him…‘We flirted back-and-forth and he asked me if I wanted to go out for dinner.’From there, they became a couple (with Rahab rethinking her decision to move), but have had to deal with judgement from other people.Rahab says, ‘My family was mad, disappointed, disgusted. I remember my sister didn’t even want to talk to me, my dad couldn’t even look at me, and my mom was mad but she was there for me.‘I don’t really have a lot of friends but the friends that I had at the nursing home they felt the same way as my family. Most of my friends are my cousins and I thought my cousins would be there for me and defend me when the rest of the family were saying disgusting and horrible things about me, but until today they still don’t defend me.She turned to Joe for solace, saying, ‘When a situation like this happens, what I do is I just distance myself and I go home and I cry to Joe. I don’t know exactly what they’re trying to do, but all they’re doing is just bringing me and Joe even closer.’In age-gap relationships, because the difference is right there for everyone to see instantly, it can illicit a reaction from people.It’s not always the healthiest thing to retreat into yourselves in situations like this, but usually the longer you’re together, the less this reaction will persist.People will eventually come round to you as a couple, rather than simply looking at the difference in age. In the meantime, all you can do is ‘do you’.Rahab also says that getting looks from family and strangers can hurt, although she tells us, ‘lately we haven’t been getting any looks whatsoever – or maybe I don’t notice it anymore.’Stopping yourself from caring about any weird looks or comments certainly isn’t the easiest thing in the world, but Rahab tells us it’s what you need to do to stay sane.Behind closed doors, Rahab says they have little niggles, but nothing major. She hates the way he snores at night and he hates the way she grinds her teeth in her sleep, and Rahab says: ‘No couple is perfect, especially not us.’One of the things that comes up time and time again in age-gap partnerships is the potential for a power imbalance.For Rahab and Joe this hasn’t been an issue – probably because they were working at the same place when they got together. However, when the older counterpart makes significantly more money or is in a higher position professionally, this can seep into your romantic life.If the older partner is used to getting what they want, particularly around younger subordinates, they may struggle to change their habits at home.It’s also worth noting the reason for them dating someone younger. Sometimes, it’s that you both just click, but in some situations it can be that they (consciously or subconsciously) want to take advantage of your naivete.Percy Pig is getting married so where the f*** is my ring?For Joe and Rahab, the age difference has actually benefited her more, as she feels more secure. She says, ‘The best part of being in a age gap relationship is Joe is very clean, so he picks up after me, does my laundry, cooks dinner every night, and takes real good care of me’.Not having to deal with a young guy who doesn’t know how to work the hoover is a huge plus for some. Rahab also says she enjoys, ‘not having to deal with other girls, not worrying about him texting other girls… Basically no bullsh*t.’Do people become more straightforward and honest as they age? Perhaps it’s always been Joe’s way. However, they’re still going strong after a year, so they’re certainly doing something right.MORE: Paul Hollywood’s ex-wife shares ‘easy tart’ recipe as Paul’s 22-year-old lover defends age gap"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/21/4BBDB2EF00000578-5679959-image-m-86_1525207260912.jpg","title":"The Queen flies Kensington Palace helicopter meet Prince Louis","story":"    The Queen emerges from a helicopter after flying the short journey to Kensington Palace to meet Prince Louis  The Queen had flown from Windsor  to see her sixth great-grandchild, Prince Louis, for the first time yesterday          The Queen, carrying her Launer handbag, climbed out of the helicopter at Kensington Palace and walked across the grass      Look radiant in a red dress like the Duchess in Jenny PackhamShop the ready-to-wear line here at NET-A-PORTERThe newest member of the Royal family has finally arrived, and of course all eyes are on the doors of the Lindo Wing to get a glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s baby boy.

The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that. For decades, Noonan was suspected of being a predatory sex offender by the police, the public, fellow villains and even members of his own family.But he did not have any criminal convictions for a sex offence to confirm the rumours - until now.The defendant, from Moston, Manchester, was described as a \u0027persistent sexual offender\u0027 on the first day of his trial, as he pleaded not guilty to all charges including eight counts of indecent assault and attempted rape.  Extraordinary moment British man \u0027walked into a Colorado art...Estate agent, 27, caught doing 72mph in 40mph zone in her...Share this articleThe court heard he groomed and molested boys after plying them with drink.In his opening statement, prosecutor Darren Preston told Manchester Crown Court: \u0027It is the prosecution case that over many years, the defendant engaged and was acting as a persistent sexual predator.  He is already serving an 11-year sentence for arson, blackmail and perverting the course of justice, passed in 2015. The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that\u0027He surrounded himself with young teenage boys, usually vulnerable boys, has groomed them by plying them with alcohol, favours and sometimes threats, and has routinely sexually abused them.\u0027He also traded on what he perceived was his notoriety and reputation in the local area.\u0027 His first victim was aged just 10 when Noonan, who was six years older, took him from a care home and indecently assaulted him twice, ordering the boy not to tell anyone.The second victim said he was 16 or 17 when he first met Noonan outside a pizzeria. He told how Noonan threatened him, accusing him of having called him \u0027gay\u0027, before he was beaten by a gang of teens with hockey sticks. He then indecently assaulted the boy on a few occasions, once in a disused shop.A third victim said he was in his early teens in the 2000s when he met Noonan, who molested him on 20 or more occasions. He described how he would spend time driving around with Noonan and other young lads. He would be taken to parties where there was drink and drugs. Noonan would ply them with drink, but not get drunk himself. His victim described being \u0027brainwashed\u0027 into thinking the abuse was normal.The fourth victim was aged in his mid-teens when he met Noonan in the 2000s, agreeing to renovate a pub for him. This victim was said to be completely under Noonan\u0027s spell.At the conclusion of his trial at Manchester Crown Court, Noonan was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault, one of attempted rape, two of inciting a child into sexual activity, one of sexual assault and one of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child.  One of 14 siblings, Noonan became the spokesman for the family following death of his brother Damian, aged 37, in a motorbike accident in the Dominican Republic in 2004, followed by the murder of his brother Dessie in 2005.Dessie and Damian had worked on the door of the Hacienda in the 1980s and were then said to control the supply of drugs at the nightclub.When they died, Dominic Noonan became the boss, or at least he gave the appearance of being the head of the family.A cunning, intelligent inidual, he admitted to being \u0027thoroughly dishonest\u0027 during his trial. He has trumpeted that he is anti-racist and has made much of being able to speak Urdu although, actually, he only knows a few phrases. Over the years, Greater Manchester Police have found little difficulty in obtaining evidence to lock him up for everything from possessing a gun to arson and blackmail.He has spent most of his adult life behind bars. But proving he was a predatory sex offender was another matter. In 2010, a rape charge was dropped. Shortly after he was released from a long prison sentence on licence, he was accused of raping a woman in a hotel room after celebrating his birthday but prosecutors dropped the case.  In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prisonIn 2013, he was cleared of child rape charges after the court heard his accuser had a history of making false complaints. He had been accused of molesting the boy of 15 in a flat in Bloom Street in Manchester city centre.In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prison.Police, paramedics and firefighters had to rescue him in a £30,000 operation as more than 1,000 people gathered to watch in the city centre. Officers said his \u0027outrageous\u0027 actions endangered the lives of tourists - including a petrified three-year-old boy - who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in Piccadilly Gardens for two hours.The drama, which began after Noonan was told he had breached his licence conditions, started when he yelled: \u0027I am going to jump.\u0027 in 2016, he was found not guilty of engaging in a sex act in front of a minor, although he was convicted of perverting the course of justice by offering £5,000 to the boy\u0027s family to get the charge dropped. The prosecution alleged that the boy covered his face with a poster as a \u0027vulnerable\u0027 adult man was intimidated into performing a sex act on Noonan in a bedroom, he was also convicted of arson and blackmail connected to a row over an ice cream van, and jailed for eleven years.So, while police have tried many times, it is only now that Noonan has been brought to justice for sex offences."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/08/4BCBB2FC00000578-0-image-m-10_1525334205054.jpg","title":"Estate agent caught doing 72mph 40mph zone late work avoids speeding ban","story":"    Nicola Robinson, 27, was clocked doing 72mph in a 40mph zoneAn estate agent caught doing 72mph in a 40mph zone has escaped a road ban after she blamed her driving on being late for work.Nicola Robinson, 27, was clocked at nearly twice the legal limit as she sped through Manchester city centre in her red BMW 116i Sport.The senior sales negotiator for estate agents Jordan Fishwick was travelling from her parents\u0027 luxury barn conversion in Bolton.She had faced a possible disqualification of up to 56 days under rules targeting drivers who travel at 45 per cent above the limit.But at Manchester magistrates court Miss Robinson, who has a clean driving record in ten years of motoring, escaped with six penalty points after telling JPs a ban could mean her losing her job and not being able to pay rent to her parents.She admitted speeding but urged the court not to ban her adding: \u0027I will never do it again - all of my life I have been an estate agent and I don\u0027t know what else I would do.\u0027She also said she had installed a \u0027speed limiter\u0027 in her BMW allowing her to set a maximum speed she can travel at.The incident occurred on July 13 last year when Miss Robinson was flashed by a camera on the A6 Broad Street in Salford as she was driving into work for an afternoon shift. The court heard she was brought before JPs due to the speed she was travelling at.

He said there is lots of fine-grained ash, which can affect people\u0027s breathing and respiratory functioning.Other countries including France, New Zealand and Australia provided aid and financial help for the earlier evacuation. Australia on Thursday announced it was providing 300,000 dollars to help with the island\u0027s permanent evacuation, with a focus on the needs of women, children and people with disabilities.

Others have strong cultural associations.\u0027Scott said the Manaro volcano on Ambae island had a large eruption about 400 years ago and has had several smaller eruptions over the past 100 years. There have been three phases in the current eruption, with the most recent phase, which started in March, producing the most ash.He said the volcano has actually quietened down over the past two weeks, although there is no way of predicting if and when the next explosive phase would begin.Asked if there was a chance that the residents might be able to one day move back to the island, Bule, the government spokesman, said that was not a question for him.\u0027We don\u0027t know,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ll have to ask the volcano.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/10/4BCC394E00000578-0-image-a-16_1525338178978.jpg","title":"Shopkeeper sprays WD 40 two licence raiders Manchester","story":"    This is the terrifying moment an armed raider threatened a shop keeper with an iron bar          Luckily, the shopkeeper had a can of WD-40 behind the counter and sprayed the oil at the raiders who were forced to retreatThe hooded pair, one armed with a crowbar, demanded cash and threatened the lone shopkeeper.CCTV released by police shows one of the thugs raising the crowbar behind his head as if to strike the worker.Footage also shows the second offender grabbing a bottle of wine from the shelf and throwing it at the worker.Hither Green residents BLOCKADE their road ahead of today\u0027s...New York photographer captures stunning series of pictures...Share this articleBoth thugs fled empty-handed, towards Palatine Road, but only after the shopkeeper showered them both with blasts from the penetrating fluid.Detectives said the men involved would have smelt \u0027very strongly of chemicals\u0027 from the aerosol and issued an appeal for witnesses to come forward.Detective Con Christopher Clarke said: \u0027This was a cowardly attempt to steal the hard-earned profits from a business.\u0027The shop worker has shown immense bravery resisting the robbers armed only with oil spray.\u0027The offenders responsible would have smelt very strongly of chemicals and we ask anyone who knows their identity to contact police.\u0027Greater Manchester Police said no one has been arrested or charged in connection with the first attack, which took place on March 17.Detectives are keeping an open mind as to whether they are linked.CCTV footage released by police of the first raid shows one of the robbers opening out a green bed sheet, which the gang filled with cigarettes and alcohol, before they escaped in a black 5 Series BMW, which had been parked up outside the shop.The car drove off along Royle Green Road then turned left onto Longley Lane. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/11/4BCDCE3800000578-5686433-image-m-4_1525342970830.jpg","title":"Man tuxedo chases handbag thief","story":"    The hero in a tuxedo who chased down a phone thief in Holburn, London has revealed he is a former sprinter who warned the mugger: \u0027I\u0027m a former track-star, you\u0027ll never outrun me\u0027.

But I would also say that the number of people I count as close friends has trebled in the last couple of years.\u0027Ms Ryder, who posed as Zendaya, runs her own fitness classes for mothers from her garden. She said the mother photoshoot sends a powerful message.She gave up her job of 15 years as a project manager at Microsoft to start up Fit Inside Out Ltd. Ms Ryder said: \u0027What I really hope people take away from this photoshoot is that we\u0027ve all taken risks to follow our passions.\u0027It\u0027s not like it\u0027s been easy for us to do this because we can fall back on the income of our other half. Me and my partner deliberately decided to take less of an income so that I could do this, and so we could spend more time with our kids. I hope that message comes across - that it\u0027s perfectly okay to just follow your passion. \u0027And hopefully it\u0027s a message that the Mum Bosses can teach our kids, too. The big question is, can mothers have it all? And I think in this day and age, the answer is: yes they can.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/12/4BCBDAB600000578-0-image-a-16_1525346858569.jpg","title":"Windsor prepares Prince Harry Meghan Markles Royal wedding","story":"    Preparations have begun in earnest for the second Royal event of the summer as Prince Harry prepares to tie the knot with actress Meghan Markle. Heartwarming pictures show residents in the historical market town of Windsor getting into the full spirit of the event with pubs decorating their windows with royal memorabilia, bunting and Union Jacks adorning the walls          A gift shop selling trinkets dedicated to all things royal has a life size cutout of the happy couple peeking out from the front door welcoming customers inA gift shop selling trinkets dedicated to all things royal has a life size cut-out of the happy couple peeking out from behind the front door welcoming customers inside.Bunting has been hung from turret to turret with Union Jacks waving in the breeze ahead of an expected heatwave throughout May, delivering what royal fans hope will be a perfect spring wedding for the 33-year-old prince.While locals have been spotted soaking up the sun outside pubs adorned with royal memorabilia, including one with a cut-out of Harry and Meghan peering out through a top window looking down on the happy revellers.\u0027It\u0027s not too late!\u0027 Meghan Markle\u0027s brother Thomas pens...Ready for rain or shine!

In exchange, Iran regained access to the global banking system and could sell its oil again on the world market.Airplane manufacturers, carmakers and others have rushed into Iran after the accord. However, some Western firms have grown increasingly reluctant to enter the market, in part over Trump\u0027s constant criticism on the campaign trail and from the White House on the deal.While directly criticising the U.S. and Europe, Zarif did appear to leave some wiggle room for possible negotiations, however.

Analysts and family members of dual nationals and others detained in Iran say hard-liners in the Islamic Republic\u0027s security agencies use the prisoners as bargaining chips in negotiations with the West.A U.N. panel in September described \u0027an emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals\u0027 in Iran, which Tehran denied.The video comes amid intense lobbying on Trump from all sides. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself earlier this week gave an English-language presentation on what he called a \u0027half ton\u0027 of Iranian nuclear documents illicitly seized by Israeli intelligence.Netanyahu said the documents provided evidence that Iran attempted to develop a nuclear bomb in the 2000s. The United Nations\u0027 atomic watchdog previously reported such efforts and said it has \u0027no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009.\u0027Zarif himself dismissed Netanyahu\u0027s presentation as \u0027a rehash of old allegations\u0027 and called the prime minister \u0027the boy who can\u0027t stop crying wolf.\u0027In the video, Zarif also appears to troll Trump as well by making a real-estate analogy to the former developer.\u0027When you buy a house and move your family in it or demolish it to build a skyscraper, you cannot come back two years later and renegotiate the price,\u0027 he says.            President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the nuclear agreement by May 12 if it is not renegotiated and changed"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/14/4BCF6A2200000578-5687011-image-a-49_1525352651894.jpg","title":"Car seen driving Beachy Head cliff plunging 531 feet","story":"    Police are on the scene after a car was seen driving over Beachy Head cliff and plunging 531 feet          It is currently unclear how many people were inside the vehicle, which slid off the edge of Beachy Head          Coastguard, Sussex Police, the RNLI and East Sussex Fire and Rescue are on the scene after the car plunged over near the lighthouseA spokesman for Sussex police said the car had been found and a recovery operation was underway.The force said: \u0027Emergency services were called at 11.15am on Thursday to a report a car had been seen to drive off cliffs at Beachy Head.Death toll of hikers trapped overnight on Swiss Alps after...Madeleine McCann\u0027s parents insist \u0027hope and perseverance...Share this article\u0027A car has been seen over the cliff and recovery is underway.\u0027Coastguard, lifeboat and East Sussex Fire and Rescue are in attendance.\u0027  A spokeswoman for the Marine Coastguard said: \u0027About 11.15am today East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service requested HM Coastguard assistance at Beachy Head, after receiving reports that a car had gone over the cliff near the lighthouse.\u0027           Emergency services were this morning called to Beachy Head after a car fell 531 feet  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/15/4BCFD95500000578-5687053-image-a-13_1525356428006.jpg","title":"Lexus motorist parks middle busy road collect dry cleaning","story":"    The driver of the Lexus, which had a private plate stops in the middle of the street outside Paddington Station in central London          The man is shown shaking his finger at workmen as he pulls up on the street which has one lane blocked by roadworksOvertaking driver loses control and smashes into the side of...Drunk teacher’s own dashcam captures her crashing into the...Share this articleBut the man is shown shaking his finger around at them as he he throws his dry cleaning in the boot.The other man, who appeared from the dry cleaning shop to hand over the clothes, almost has his hand shut in the boot door,He manages to stuff the enormous bag of dry cleaning into his boot while another workman is shown filming the whole incident unfold.The man then speeds off in his car while traffic is shown piling up in the opposite lane.The clip was filmed by Kev Grosvenor who shared it on Facebook yesterday.

Kim\u0027s meeting with Xi was his first foreign visit since he took power in 2011.  Today\u0027s meeting between Kim and Wang was held at the headquarters of Workers\u0027 Party of Korea, according to China\u0027s state newspaper People\u0027s Daily.China\u0027s president Xi extended greetings to Kim through Wang, said People\u0027s Daily.     China\u0027s president Xi (right) met Kim (left) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in March          ​​​​China\u0027s foreign minister, Wang Yi (left), arrived in North Korea\u0027s capital on Wednesday.

The North Korean leader reportedly called the relation between Pyongyang and Beijing \u0027extremely precious\u0027 and vowed to reinforce and develop the \u0027friendly cooperation\u0027 between the two nations.   Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (center) is welcomed by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Ri Kil Song (right) on his arrival at Pyongyang Airport, North Korea, on Wednesday  Beijing is trying to ensure a larger role  in the new round of nuclear diplomacy with PyongyangWang Yi\u0027s visit came days after Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work toward the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the Korean Peninsula, though they did not mention specific plans or timetables.They also agreed to work toward formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War and push for three-way talks with Washington or four-way talks that also include Beijing to do so. The Koreas can\u0027t officially end the war themselves because South Korea wasn\u0027t a direct signatory to the armistice that stopped the fighting but left the peninsula technically in a state of war.More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation - including what, when and how it would occur - are expected between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who could meet in May or June. The North\u0027s state-media have not yet commented on Wang\u0027s arrival in Pyongyang.Wang is likely to use his visit to further ensure that Beijing would not be sidelined in the high-stakes discussions surrounding the North. Some South Korean analysts believe Wang would specifically seek Kim\u0027s commitment that the process on formally ending the war would include China.

Kim\u0027s Beijing visit was widely seen as a move to strengthen his leverage ahead of his talks with Trump by re-introducing China as a major player in the global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff.Analysts say Kim would have asked China, North Korea\u0027s only major ally and main economic lifeline, to soften its enforcement of sanctions aimed at the North. Kim also may have sought Chinese commitments to strongly oppose any military measure the United States might take should his talks with Trump fall apart and the North starts testing missiles again.While the Kim-Trump talks is shaping up to be crucial, there\u0027s still widespread doubt whether Kim will ever agree to entirely abandon his nuclear weapons when he apparently sees them as providing his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.Seoul has said Kim expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \u0027denuclearization\u0027 that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.Kim\u0027s move to re-insert China as a major player in the process has been seen as a sign that the North\u0027s traditional stance essentially remains. Beijing has been calling for a \u0027dual suspension\u0027 - of the North\u0027s nuclear and missile activities and of the large-scale military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/01/1AC9DEEE00000514-0-image-m-51_1525220799382.jpg","title":"Hamleys owner control House Fraser shut stores","story":"      Closures: House of Fraser plans to shut a number of its department stores across the UKC.banner has purchased a 51 per cent stake in House of Fraser, which was previously controlled by Chinese group Nanjing Cenbest, which is part of the Sanpower conglomerate. Cenbest, which is part of the Sanpower Group, will remain a significant minority shareholder.

Marrakech in Morocco is only forecast to reach 73F (23C).Miss Yeomans said the warm and sunny weather forecast for southern Britain is a reversal of conditions in early May last year.     The sun rises over a beautiful bluebell wood in Meopham, Kent, this morning as the sun shines over much of Britain today          The sun is seen rising over skyscrapers in the City of London financial district in the capital this morning          This stunning sunrise was captured from Greenwich in South East London this morning at about 5am          A ship sails across the horizon on the North Sea as the sun rises at 5.20am today near Cullercoats, off Tyne and WearThen, it was warm and sunny in Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland but cool and cloudy in the south and east.In its long-range forecast from the middle of next week towards mid-May, the Met Office said there is \u0027some uncertainty\u0027 but notes that \u0027at this stage it looks like most places will stay mainly dry with sunny spells\u0027.The return to warm and sunny weather follows very wet weather in southern and eastern England earlier this week.On Monday, three inches of rain fell in 24 hours in the wettest areas yesterday - 50 per cent more than the April average.Temperatures of just 42F (5.5C) in Frittenden, Kent and 46F (8C) in Norwich were recorded.

The North Korean leader reportedly called the relation between Pyongyang and Beijing \u0027extremely precious\u0027 and vowed to reinforce and develop the \u0027friendly cooperation\u0027 between the two nations.   Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (center) is welcomed by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Ri Kil Song (right) on his arrival at Pyongyang Airport, North Korea, on Wednesday  Beijing is trying to ensure a larger role  in the new round of nuclear diplomacy with PyongyangWang Yi\u0027s visit came days after Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work toward the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the Korean Peninsula, though they did not mention specific plans or timetables.They also agreed to work toward formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War and push for three-way talks with Washington or four-way talks that also include Beijing to do so. The Koreas can\u0027t officially end the war themselves because South Korea wasn\u0027t a direct signatory to the armistice that stopped the fighting but left the peninsula technically in a state of war.More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation - including what, when and how it would occur - are expected between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who could meet in May or June. The North\u0027s state-media have not yet commented on Wang\u0027s arrival in Pyongyang.Wang is likely to use his visit to further ensure that Beijing would not be sidelined in the high-stakes discussions surrounding the North. Some South Korean analysts believe Wang would specifically seek Kim\u0027s commitment that the process on formally ending the war would include China.

Kim\u0027s Beijing visit was widely seen as a move to strengthen his leverage ahead of his talks with Trump by re-introducing China as a major player in the global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff.Analysts say Kim would have asked China, North Korea\u0027s only major ally and main economic lifeline, to soften its enforcement of sanctions aimed at the North. Kim also may have sought Chinese commitments to strongly oppose any military measure the United States might take should his talks with Trump fall apart and the North starts testing missiles again.While the Kim-Trump talks is shaping up to be crucial, there\u0027s still widespread doubt whether Kim will ever agree to entirely abandon his nuclear weapons when he apparently sees them as providing his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.Seoul has said Kim expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \u0027denuclearization\u0027 that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.Kim\u0027s move to re-insert China as a major player in the process has been seen as a sign that the North\u0027s traditional stance essentially remains. Beijing has been calling for a \u0027dual suspension\u0027 - of the North\u0027s nuclear and missile activities and of the large-scale military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76191c9e3a28ee6cf502548ca2e2d11608e29ccd/0_105_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e025f389207f6ae8da13dd37c1ddeac","title":"temperate house kew gardens review king of greenhouses 41m restoration","story":"The spruced-up Decimus Burton masterpiece at Kew Gardens doesn’t just have new glass and paint – 10,000 plants have been replaced so specimens can grow for generations to comeFeral goats are the greatest threat to the rare cabbage tree, according to a sign in Kew Gardens’ newly restored Temperate House, the largest Victorian glasshouse in the world, which reopens this week after a £41m, five-year renovation. Goats were never much of a threat at Kew, where the endangered species has been carefully cultivated since a specimen was found on the tiny, volcanic Robinson Crusoe Island near Chile. But rusting iron columns and creaky windows had posed a significant danger, to plants and humans alike.A government report into the state of the national botanic gardens in 2010 concluded of the building that “urgent restoration is essential if closure is to be avoided”. Windows had been sealed shut in a 1970s refurb and masonry cladding was crumbling off in chunks. The last five years have seen 69,000 inidual elements removed and repaired and 15,000 panes of glass replaced, all under the safe cover of a temporary tent big enough to hold three Boeing 747s. It has been a mammoth undertaking, and the result is suitably breathtaking.Those who remember entering the thick green gauntlet, surrounded on all sides by dense forest, might be shocked by the pruning. For the first time since the glasshouse opened in 1862, the entire contents of the beds have been removed, soil and all, and the layout reconfigured to be more akin to the Victorian original. Ten thousand plants have been replaced with younger specimens, mostly cultivated from cuttings of their forebears, while some famous residents have been carefully returned after spending the last few years in a temporary nursery. Kew’s rarest (and loneliest) plant of all, a male Wood’s cycad, is back in position, still awaiting the discovery of a female of the species in some untrodden corner of the planet. Compared with the previous overgrown riot, where spiky leaves of cycads rubbed up against the trunks of bitter orange trees, and tree ferns competed for space with rhododendrons, it now feels more like the architecture, rather than the plants, is the star of the show.“It was heartbreaking to see some of the trees go,” says Kew’s fittingly named Greg Redwood, head of glasshouses, who has been working here for 34 years. “But some of them were hitting the roof, and it was very difficult to raise new specimens under the thick canopy.” Older plants were producing fewer seeds, making it essential to renew the collection. “After years of pruning, a lot of the plants were effectively bonsais.”The cull means that Decimus Burton’s triumph of iron and glass is fully visible for the first time in a generation. Cast-iron columns support great arcing ribs of wrought iron that leap across the space, their detail visible up close from the upper-level walkway that rings the main pavilion, providing precipitous views down to the fledging canopy. Under the guidance of heritage experts Donald Insall Associates, the ironwork has been repaired and recast in places, the decades of paintwork scrubbed off with ground garnet and repainted with five coats of the hardwearing paint used on oil rigs. Outside, the plasterwork details, previously obliterated by years of gloopy paint, are visible once again: cornucopias heave with pomegranates, pineapples and soursops, while terracotta baskets (which cleverly disguise historic chimney flues) brim with moulded flowers.Begun in 1859, the same year that Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published, the Temperate House was to be the crowning glory of Kew, a five-pavilion complex stretching almost 200 metres atop a raised berm, like a fleet of crystal tankers processing across the lawn. It was planned to be the first thing visitors would see as they entered the gardens, standing at the end of the avenue from the station as a stately beacon. “It was Burton’s tomb to himself, twice the size of his Palm House,” says project architect Amy Felton. “But like many buildings of this size, it didn’t quite go according to plan.”During the parliamentary debate to allocate funding, the influential politician and greenhouse impresario Joseph Paxton opposed the proposed cost, insisting the building could be erected for a third of the requested budget. He warned that Kew was in danger of turning into “a gaudy flower garden”. No doubt concerned by the prospect of competition for his own Crystal Palace, then run as a private venture, his objection carried weight and the Treasury only sanctioned £10,000 for Kew’s new glasshouse, rather than the £30,000 requested. The station didn’t materialise where expected either: it was ultimately built 500 metres to the north, leaving the glasshouse stranded, away from the main entrance.By the time of Burton’s death in 1881, only the central pavilion had been completed. The unfinished building was described as a “chronic eyesore” by Kew’s director in his plea for further funds, and it would take another 18 years to see the full thing finished, by which time it had outlived two directors and its architect – 40 years after Burton had drawn up the designs. Compared with the startling futurism of his Palm House, an ethereal soap bubble formed from great sheets of curved glass, the train-shed bulk of the Temperate House was deemed to be rather prosaic.For the modern visitor, the protracted process brings added interest. The sluggish pace of the whole endeavour allows you to see the changing fashions of the day, with the latest trends embodied in its different wings. The acanthus leaf column capitals of the early phase give way to a simpler, stripped-back structure in the southern pavilion, while floral motifs on the wrought-iron trusses in the main house are later exchanged for plain circles and triangles. Windows operated with rack and pinion gears shaped like pterodactyl wings in the north pavilion become simpler elbow mechanisms in the south. What isn’t visible is the fact that in Burton’s day, the whole thing was glazed in green glass, thought by the Victorians to prevent scorching from the sun, while the ironwork, far from always being pristine white, has ranged from pale blue to dark green and brown.The renovations have opened up hundreds of clerestory windows that had been fixed shut in the 1970s, and installed lower-level apron vents, providing better cross-ventilation and air movement that will help the tree trunks to toughen up. Heating has been added in a new sunken trench, creating a more even atmosphere and allowing Kew to grow a broader range of plants. “Before, only the strong survived,” says Redwood.Wider central pathways allow access for cherrypickers, and a large crossing in the middle has clearly been sized with weddings and corporate event hire in mind – for which new lighting has been installed overhead and in the flowerbeds. For now, it’s all a little too stark. There is none of the lush magic of the Palm House, where it feels like an exotic specimen might engulf you into the dense foliage at any minute, and the wide straight aisles are less intriguing to explore than the narrower winding pathways. But the future of the building has been secured, and, given that some of the plants won’t mature for another 25, 50, or 75 years, you can rest assured that your grandchildren will have the pleasure of seeing them at their best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f442d892d5b8c4414edff4fe328a80559388188e/0_244_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=002444e5406adb030472fe8b6976dc46","title":"art shay acclaimed photographer in pictures","story":"Shay, who has died aged 96, photographed celebrities, politicians and ordinary Americans during a career that ned 70 years.

The city I worked in briefly in my youth still had mills towering over its hillsides and tycoon mansions lining Manningham Lane. The centre was a tight group of Victorian palaces and wool warehouses. It could just echo TS Eliot’s assurance, sitting “like a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire”. There were fashionable shops in Darley Street, once the Bond Street of the north, which was jammed with Rolls-Royces.Bradford council’s chief executive, Kersten England, is a woman on a mission. She burns with a determination to pull the city around, and aims “to make Bradford the Shoreditch of Yorkshire”. She declines to join the northern chorus for more grants, subsidies and attention from London. She has given up on competing with her neighbouring rival, booming Leeds. She wants “not to do things, but to help others to do them” – to facilitate the revival of an “alternative Bradford”.Undaunted, England led me through a maze of deserted alleys to her micro-Shoreditch, a subterranean warren of old storage tunnels and caves. Here a local developer, Graham Hall, has bravely invested £2m in craft beer pubs, gin bars, artisanal food outlets and music venues, cluttered with railway junk and industrial antiques. Sunbridgewells is a hipster cliche, but England sees it as ground zero of Bradford’s “creative hub”. She was so proud of it that last year she persuaded Princess Anne – hardly a hipster – to declare it open. The Shoreditch model requires others to flock to Sunbridgewells, but this has yet to happen. Waterstones has converted the old Wool Exchange into what must be its most exotic shop. A few pubs, such as the famous Sparrow, cling to life nearby. The Little Shop of Soaps briefly showed its artisanal face next to Sunbridgewells but is closing “for lack of footfall”, says its owner Tracey Lavelle. Up the road from Rawson Square is David Craig’s Assembly warehouse, host to a group of freelance designers and publishers. Craig reckons the space costs roughly half what it would in suburban Saltaire, and a fifth what it would in Leeds. But he is a pioneer. He admits he was drawn to Bradford by its underdog status and “gritty, do-it-yourself nature”. He and his colleagues “have a passion for the city”, even though only a few live there. As yet they are less a hub than an oasis.  Another champion of the new Bradford, Amir Hussain, is an architect with an expanding practice in the city’s Goitside district. He wants to persuade second- and third-generation Asians to come out of their suburban enclaves into the “centre of the donut”, bringing with them some of the ethnic vitality of the high streets and bazaars visible in the city’s encircling “villages”.  Bradford has long been victim of half a century of crisis in British town planning. Already in the 1970s the local council was committing suicide. As if to eradicate its past as capital of the wool trade, it began the demolition of its Victorian core and drove a road through the wreckage. Sites were cleared for blocks of what the Pevsner guide calls “mind-numbing banality”.  In the 1980s the city toyed with Thatcherism under the leadership of Eric Pickles. A third of people on the council payroll were sacked, some 9,000 jobs, with no compensating upturn in private employment. Tory Whitehall gave the city a meagre reward in the form of a photography museum and a tax office. One failed – its photographs were carted off to London’s V\u0026ampA – and the other is closing. Dispersal was the last thing central Bradford wanted. The council answered with a killer punch of its own. It cleared a 12-acre swathe of land behind the city hall for a giant, introverted shopping mall, Broadway. When it opened a few years ago, it killed all other retail activity in the city centre like a plague. I have never seen such commercial devastation caused by a single planning decision. It is hard not to warm to the determination of England and her team. Yorkshire cities are notoriously bad neighbours, and Bradford’s rivalry with Leeds, 10 miles away, is the stuff of history. But the city planner, Bhupinder Dev, knows his future lies in finding a relationship with Leeds. The contrast is almost obscene. Leeds seems rich. It has drawn big government investments in universities and hospitals. Towers of luxury flats line the old canal. Smart shops define the Headrow. Council leader Judith Blake told me her chief challenge was “an acute shortage of skilled labour”. To her, Bradford’s value to Leeds was almost humiliating – its unemployment rate and its output of school leavers.  Dev and England want Bradford to be “alternative” and creative. “We simply must make central Bradford a place in which people want to live, not from which they are desperate to move,” says Dev. Successful Asians, he says, are drifting away to Pudsey on the Leeds road to avoid a Bradford postcode.  Bradford has tried this before. Across the centre of town is Little Germany, a neighbourhood of handsome sandstone warehouses next to the cathedral. It was given a conservation makeover 10 years ago, and is home to the Bradford Playhouse and a scatter of studios and galleries. A large portrait of the city’s favourite son David Hockney adorns a building exterior. But Little Germany lacks critical mass and residents are wary of the place.  While music venues and arts festivals draw audiences, they do not draw residents. Somehow life must be breathed into dead Victorian streets and old mills. The spirit that once revived San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury, Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and the ever-cited Shoreditch must be found somewhere. These places recovered by sucking activity and enterprise from adjacent areas of wealth. Bradford must do that from Leeds.  The ShoreditchDetroit model requires extreme measures. It requires unused buildings to be released by their owners into a “down and out” economy. They must gradually attract artists, designers and writers, people who appear to find inspiration in dereliction. They in turn hand over to digital entrepreneurs and other “creatives”. Bradford may not be as desperate as Detroit, but the longer it sits and hopes, the more its centre will depopulate and deteriorate.  The Yorkshire economy has been tortoise to the hare of Manchester’s northern powerhouse. It has depended on the employment hotspots of Leeds and Sheffield, on prosperous farming and on tourism to York, Harrogate and the Dales. This has left “cold spots” in the old mining and mill towns, Barnsley, Rotherham, Wakefield and Huddersfield. The pits and the looms have disappeared and nothing has taken their place.  Bradford is the most challenging by far. It is lucky to have in England, her council leader, Susan Hinchliffe, and Leeds’s Judith Blake, leaders of stature and intelligence, who seem to get the point of Yorkshire’s future. They are well-placed to capitalise on a promised new dawn in Yorkshire politics, with Labour MP Dan Jarvis who will run for mayor of South Yorkshire. He is rumoured to have his eye on becoming mayor of all Yorkshire, of “God’s own county”. He might start by declaring Bradford “God’s own Shoreditch”.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2cd7cef4621b7d6e064186d1cb3414c2bd43592/387_1443_5067_3040/master/5067.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22c69d70decd58d9936c190620234d73","title":"off the map the secret cities behind the atom bomb manhattan project","story":"In 1943, three ordinary-looking US cities were constructed at record speed – but left off all maps. They had an extraordinary purpose: to create nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan projectby  David Smith in WashingtonIn 1943, three ordinary-looking US cities were constructed at record speed – but left off all maps. They had an extraordinary purpose: to create nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan projectby  David Smith in WashingtonSomething strange happened in the US state of Tennessee in 1943. Thousands of young workers poured into a 59,000-acre site about 25 miles west of Knoxville. Vast quantities of materials followed, never to re-emerge. Houses and other facilities were built with record speed. Yet officially Oak Ridge did not exist during the war and could not be found on any map.What was going on there? Very few people knew at the time, even among the residents. The answer was that this was the starting block in a race against Adolf Hitler to build the atom bomb. Oak Ridge was one of three “secret cities” of the Manhattan Project, along with Los Alamos in New Mexico and HanfordRichland in Washington state.More than 125,000 scientists, technicians and support staff occupied the three cities by the end of the war. There is a photo of a Santa Claus being frisked at the gates of Oak Ridge and a local newsletter stamped “restricted”. Anyone aged 12 or over had to wear an ID badge. The use of words such as “atomic” or “uranium” was taboo lest it tip off the enemy.Yet some social aspects were all too familiar: even these planned communities, which tried to offer residents an idyllic lifestyle and would influence postwar urban construction and design in America, replicated the racial segregation of the era.“At first glance they seem like very normal American communities,” says Martin Moeller, senior curator of the Secret Cities: The Architecture and Planning of the Manhattan Project exhibition, which opens on Thursday. “But then before long you start to see things that are strange in a variety of ways, sometimes humorous.”It was late 1942, less than a year after the US had entered the second world war, when the US Army Corps of Engineers quietly began acquiring vast tracts of land in remote areas of three states. The few residents of these areas were summarily evicted and their houses demolished.Soon thousands of young workers arrived from far and wide, initially occupying tents and other makeshift shelters within the newly designated military reservations. Shielded from public view by natural barriers and security fences, the workers quickly erected hundreds of buildings, ranging from prefabricated houses to industrial structures of unprecedented scale.The goal was singular. Aware that the Nazis were pursuing nuclear weapons – though they were not as far along as thought at the time – the US would invest unfathomable money and manpower to get their first. The cause could scarcely have been more urgent.“Despite that, in building these communities, it was considered important to create housing in environments that were comfortable for the people who would be working for the scientists and engineers who would be doing this important work,” explains Moeller, who first visited Oak Ridge three decades ago when his future father-in-law was a nuclear physicist with the national laboratory there.“There was agreement that they needed to feel at home. They needed to have a community that felt ‘normal’. And so during this time of national emergency, the US government built single family houses in what we would now consider typical suburban neighborhoods, instead of just jamming all of these people into dormitories and barracks as I would think almost any other country in the world would have done for time. That to me, in of itself, is extraordinary.”He adds: “These cities really were proving grounds for emerging ideas about town planning architecture and construction. In many cases they were continuing movements that were already in existence.”Built from scratch in half a year to produce fuel for atomic bombs, Oak Ridge was initially conceived as a town for 13,000 people but grew to 75,000 by the end of the war, the biggest of the secret cities. The housing was designed by Skidmore, Owings \u0026amp Merrill (SOM), now one of the biggest and most influential architecture firms in the world. And yet while Oak Ridge seemed to exist in a bubble, it was also very much of its time.Moeller continues: “Although these cities were very much conceived as forward-looking communities – they really wanted places that were idyllic in many ways, great places to raise families – nonetheless segregation was designed in from the start. It was just considered to be a given by all parties concerned. There were racial issues that were baked into these communities.”SOM’s initial plan called for a “negro village” at the eastern end of town, furthest from the work sites, which was to include housing similar to that provided for white residents. But as Oak Ridge grew quicker than expected, those plans were abandoned and most African American residents were relegated to “hutments”: rudimentary plywood structures barely superior to tents.They were frigid in the winter – heated with crude stoves – and sweltering in the summer and offered little privacy. They lacked internal plumbing so residents had to use collective toilet facilities. Even married couples were not allowed to live together in the hutment camps. And residents were routinely subjected to more surveillance from the security authorities than those living in the more permanent neighbourhoods.By the end of the war, most of the white families had been moved out of the hutments and, as the population was then shrinking, went into more permanent housing. But many of the African American families continued to live in the basic dwellings until the early 1950s. There would be a twist, however. Moeller says: “In the postwar period, Oak Ridge, having now been settled as a place full of academics and very well-educated people otherwise, was one of the leaders in the desegregation movement in the south. In fact, two of the first public schools in the south to be desegregated were in Oak Ridge. Oak Ridge even threatened to secede from Tennessee in order to desegregate. So there was a relatively quick turnaround.”When the US dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, killing tens of thousands of people to force an end to the war, the city’s secret was out. Many residents celebrated. One local newspaper declared: “Atomic super-bomb, made at Oak Ridge, strikes Japan.” Another said: “Oak Ridge Attacks Japanese ... Workers thrill as atomic bomb secret breaks press and radio stories describe ‘fantastically powerful’ weapon expected to save many lives.”All three cities remained part of the military industrial complex, continuing to work on nuclear weapons during the cold war as well as broader scientific research today Oak Ridge is heavily involved in renewable energy. The unique subcultures that grew during their early years of isolation also survive. Moeller observes: “These people really in many ways had to commit to create their own culture and interestingly, even to this day, some of the little theatre companies and musical troupes that were formed during world war two still exist and still operate as community cultural organisations in theses cities.”That includes “atomic culture”, or, to put it another way, gallows humour. At one of the most popular lunch spots in Oak Ridge, there are pictures of mushroom clouds on the wall. The logo of Richland high school contains a mushroom cloud. “There are pictures of atomic symbols and so on and I hasten to point out that that’s not because the residents of these communities are callous.“They realise the seriousness of the work that was done in those places during the war and afterwards during the cold war. But it’s kind of like doctors’ humour in emergency rooms. They’re somewhat notorious for being irreverent in their humor about medical conditions. It’s how they deal with the seriousness of what they do.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a9f0c34a41fb8ddb8b40057ab68bcb4687edf0/0_91_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b33638381ee5ec41ccc4970759f8b8","title":"harry meghan pay as you go wedding commoners royal wedding","story":"Oh, how the monarchy is modernising! Look at lovely, jokey Harry with his openness about mental health and his glowing fiancee, who astonishingly has had a life, is not a dumb blonde and says things about female independence. Oh, how they have moved on, this new generation of royals. They are just like us, after all.Except they are not. So the latest news about the commoners invited to the royal wedding is really stunning in its declaration of who’s who and what’s what. Kensington Palace (probably using the retch-inducing phrase “reach out”) announced earlier this year that Meghan and Harry were going “to allow members of the public to join in their celebration”. Very special people representing “youth” and “ersity” and – whisper it quietly – poor people would be allowed inside the perimeter of Windsor Castle. This is not just a wedding, remember, this is an attempt to build a bridge between high society and well … society.Twelve-hundred hand-picked “ordinary” people, many from charities that the royals support, will be let into the castle’s grounds. They will be there for hours and hours, and yet, it seems, they will not get so much as a vol-au-vent. Those who work with deprived and alienated people have been advised in letters from lord lieutenants “to bring a picnic lunch as it will not be possible to buy food and drink on site”. What? What kind of invite is that?It’s one that absolutely makes clear what is happening. That’s what. It never had anything to do with altruism. These ordinary people will effectively be extras for the TV coverage. They’ll make up a crowd that will be beamed around the world. The royals’ net wealth is estimated at around £400m – but now let us bow down before our rulers and hope that a garage sandwich will tide us over. Oh, I know it is not a good time to be a republican but quite honestly it never is. No one can begrudge the Queen, no one can’t admire the loveliness of Meghan, and on it goes. Only that kind of thinking is how this fountainhead of inequality is always made palatable.I once refused to go to a wedding because there was a pay bar as well as one of those irritating wedding lists. So I am not a great one for a pay-as-you-go celebrations. I can’t see it as anything other than meanness. Have a party or don’t. These occasions are actually very boring for spectators: hours of waiting around for a fleeting glimpse of a gloved hand as it speeds past. I was in the cathedral for Diana’s funeral, and on the way there we went past the crowds who had been sleeping in the street overnight. Weirdly, I was at Windsor for Harry’s father’s “low-key” wedding to Camilla, hoping, I suppose, for the ghost of Diana to appear. The crowds were quite sparse but had their flags to wave. What makes people wait for hours to do this, I remember asking a bored policeman. “We call them cat-stranglers,” he said. I didn’t know what that meant. “Women so mad they strangle their own cats,” he informed me.Now, though, the royalist media will go into overdrive and there will be a lot of reverential dross about protocol and etiquette. Debrett’s advises at least six canapes per guest before a wedding lunch. Harry and Meghan’s 600 actual guests will get the works, but the people chosen because they serve the most vulnerable in their communities will be left milling about for hours and are now Googling Windsor for the nearest supermarkets.As a metaphor for inclusivity royal-style, though, it’s all perfect, isn’t it? Do please come and gawp and cheer, but bring your own sandwiches. The meanness of the super-rich is truly something to behold. Twenty-one-year-old Saeed Atcha told the  that the news made him wonder if he should go to a nearby McDonald’s, but he wasn’t sure whether he’d be allowed to bring in a filet meal. He set up a magazine in Bolton after the 2011 riots and talked of the bemusement of some of the disadvantaged people his charity helps that the royals will scarcely offer invitees a drink. “It’s unfathomable,” he said. Not really, it’s the monarchy. Same as it ever was."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17a6b639b122aff50982328b3b2c280bb7dba176/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ff819b800044015c66aab4bf242519c","title":"sajid javid father immigration poverty british pakistani tory","story":"Sajid Javid’s father, Abdul, came to Britain from Pakistan with a pound in his pocket and became a bus driver in Rochdale. As a six-year-old, Sajid used to interpret for his mother, Zubaid, who took 10 years to learn English. At one stage Sajid shared a room with his parents in a two-bedroom house where he lived with his four brothers. His school careers adviser told him to be a TV repair man since children like him should not aim too high. Instead he was the first in his family to go to university, became the youngest ever vice-president at Chase Manhattan bank and then went on to become a board member of Deutsche Bank before entering parliament in 2010.We know this because Javid often evokes his personal story, as any skilled politician might, for effect. Monday, when he replaced Amber Rudd as home secretary, was no different. On his first day on the job, Javid insisted that the Windrush scandal was to him not just political, but personal. “Like the Caribbean Windrush generation, my parents came to this country from the Commonwealth in the 1960s,” he said. “So when I heard that people who are outstanding pillars of their community were being impacted simply for not having the right documents to prove their legal status in the UK, I thought it could be my mum, my brother, my uncle – even me.”But, for all the talk about how Javid’s elevation should be celebrated as evidence of a government broadening its pool of talent at the highest level, the truth is that, were it up to the policies of this government, there would be no Javid. His father would never have been allowed in. And Javid’s OK with that. “It’s absolutely right that today we should have an immigration policy based more on skills,” he told the  three years ago.If ever there was an illustration of the distinction between the symbolic value of representation and the substantial need to redress systemic inequality, it is this: a man who extols his own story as an example of what is possible, even as he actively seeks to ensure that this story should be denied to those who come after him. To those who see ersity as an end in itself, rather than a means of securing greater equality and less discrimination, Javid’s promotion denotes meaningful progress. That is the sloppy liberal thinking on which rightwing opportunism thrives, and which Angela Davis once described to me as “the difference that brings no difference and the change that brings no change”. Symbols should not be mistaken for substance, lest we end up not with equal opportunities for many, but photo opportunities for a few.But they should not be dismissed as entirely insubstantial either. In a cabinet where there are more former Oxford Union presidents than there are minorities, it matters that the state school-educated son of Pakistani migrants has a top job that covers policing, immigration and security. He brings a set of experiences, from discrimination to family poverty, that are lacking in the highest levels of government.The fact that he is a millionaire and a Tory does not insulate him from racism. On the Guido Fawkes website, a Conservative site where bigots go to reinforce their rage, his appointment was greeted with the following comments: “It rather appears the white man’s burden has moved in with us for good” “He’s looking forward to being joined by millions of others from Turkey” and “Never trust an Arab.” (Let’s forget that Pakistan is not in the Arab world and further from Turkey than Britain.)A few, accusing him of racial treachery, called him a “coconut” (black on the outside, white on the inside) and a token. That is offensive. His race does not define him. Who we are does not determine what we do or what we think. There is nothing intrinsic about being of Pakistani origin that prevents someone becoming a Conservative.So there is symbolic value to his appointment. But unlike the comedian George Carlin, I think symbols are far too important to be left to the symbol-minded. Symbolic advances are far more limited and contingent than their advocates generally admit. The first black leader of a significant political party in the Netherlands was Joao Varela, a migrant who briefly headed Pim Fortuyn’s anti-immigration party after Fortuyn was assassinated. The French far right Front National has black supporters and had a handful of non-white representatives Ben Carson, the housing and urban development secretary under Donald Trump, last year referred to slaves as immigrants. Should we claim the advances of all these people as victories for ersity? If not then, clearly, we have to be careful about what symbols we are promoting.I’m delighted for Meghan Markle and her upcoming nuptials with Prince Harry. But those who claim it marks a step forward for black people in Britain fail to engage with the symbol in question. A royal family establishes inherited privilege at the heart of our system of government and embeds patronage at the centre of our politics. The prospect of a black princess illustrates that black people can now be as elitist, exclusory and hierarchical as whites, and that white elites are prepared to accept them on those terms.Which brings us back to Javid, who comes not only with an ethnicity but a record. He has consistently voted for tougher immigration and asylum laws, including the “hostile environment” policy, and for slashing benefits to the poor. There is no evidence that he has ever leveraged his experiences as the child of working-class migrants to do anything positive for migrants, their children or the working class (British-Pakistanis have among the highest rates of unemployment and poverty). He recognises that those threatened with deportation could have been his parents he fails to acknowledge that he voted for the very policies that would have facilitated their removal and, unless he changes the policy, could be their deporter.The Windrush scandal has perfectly illustrated that racism is not simply a matter of mean-spirited iniduals doing bad things – though it can be that too – but a system that excludes and marginalises people of colour. The point is not to change the identities of the people operating that system, but to dismantle it and build something fairer. When ersity is about a system looking different but acting the same, it serves not the excluded but the system itself.It is clear what this promotion does for Javid I have yet to hear a convincing case for what it might do for people who look like him or share his background. Javid may have broken through the glass ceiling, but it’s difficult to see what use that is to those trapped in the basement. Especially when he keeps disabling the lift."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b4fd9869ad7e5d104d1c33108bccd6f4b89fad8/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22fcf922a38ee908f7b34614c212c735","title":"bath museum of east asian art to reopen","story":"MEAA marks 25th anniversary with new exhibition though room that was broken into remains closedStaff at a museum in Bath have spoken of their heartbreak at the theft of priceless jade and gold artefacts as they prepare to open again with a bittersweet exhibition reflecting on health and wellbeing.Detectives are still hunting a gang of raiders who broke into the Museum of East Asian Art (MEAA), a hidden jewel in one of city’s Georgian terraces, last month. The thieves got in through a first-floor window and targeted seven display cases containing culturally significant objects including jade figures. They ignored other items, suggesting the burglary was carefully planned. “It’s personal for the team as well. The reward of the job for us is showing the collection, the culture and art of east Asia to the general public and we were forced to close.” The museum upgraded its security in 2016 so it could borrow objects from the British Museum but is having to review its arrangements again. Chiang said: “They seemed quite professional. They were targeting jade and gold objects.” But she said the museum would be no less welcoming to the public: “The art needs to be seen otherwise it loses its value.” The gallery will reopen to the public on Saturday in time to celebrate its 25th anniversary, though the room that was broken into is still closed. The shattered display cabinets remain empty. Visitors will instead be treated to an exhibition by the Chinese artist Zhang Yanzi called A Quest for Wellness – an appropriate subject for Bath, where people have visited the city’s hot springs for many centuries.The centrepiece of the exhibition is a silk robe brightly decorated in tablets donated to the artist by her friends. Another piece comprises gauze bandages daubed with cinnabar moulded into the shape of mountains a third is a collection of bracelets made out of pills. Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, said small museums like the MEAA were the lifeblood of the city and needed to feel secure. “Bath is a city with lots of small museums.” she said. “They help our city thrive. They are one of the reasons so many come here. We really need to help and support them and make sure they can do well in an atmosphere in which they feel protected.” She said the raid should make the police think twice about the closure of the main police station in the area. Hobhouse said: “Unfortunately we’ve lost our police station in Bath. That sort of thing makes it easier for professional criminals. We should reflect on that and think again whether we should have our police station back. “Local people have been very uncomfortable about not having a police station. We can’t say it’s a direct causal link but it may have made a difference.”The raid on the MEAA in Bennett Street took place at about 1.20am on 17 April. Police, who reached the scene within five minutes of receiving an alert, said the burglary was well planned and swift, and that the artefacts may have been stolen to order.Based close to the Royal Crescent, the MEAA bills itself as the only UK museum dedicated to the arts and cultures of eastern and south-eastern Asia. It opened in 1993 and features thousands of objects from the region. Some of its Chinese art dates from 5000BC.The police said the items taken were a jade monkey holding a peach, jade mandarin ducks with lotus flowers, an inlaid wooden covered box, a soapstone figure of the Han dynasty scholar, writer and jester, Dongfang Shuo, a set of 14 gold belt plaques and a Jizhou stoneware vase.• The Bath Museum of East Asian Art reopens with A Quest for Wellness on 5 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e35c98cd6c53b424b57de66b6882dbbc340caea/0_50_1055_633/master/1055.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9886b26a949ac33d0378a9b41f69f082","title":"class struggle working class unemployed become t shirt slogans","story":"T-shirts emblazoned with words such as “working class” and “broke” have become a weird micro trend in fashion. It’s just the latest example of fashion revelling in poverty chicThe old adage “It’s hip to be square” needs updating. These days, it’s glam to be poor.This product was not unique. A few months previously, H\u0026ampM ran a line of garish orange tracksuits bearing the moniker “Unemployed”. Again, there was a furore online: “Funny how H\u0026ampM has a jumper with the slogan ‘unemployed’ for, like, £25. I’m employed and don’t have £25 for a jumper,” shot back one Twitter user. The products were removed from sale.  contacted H\u0026ampM, but the company declined to comment on the product or its removal. It does, however, currently have a new orange hoodie with the word “Broke” emblazoned on it on sale for £19.99. There are plenty of other poverty-celebrating slogans for sale. BooHoo retails a “Young Dumb Broke” T-shirt, while Baby Girls Club and Pink Uzi offer “Too Poor for Dior” options. Wuggle offers a whole colour palette of “Council Estate Princess” slogan items. DonkeyTees, TeePublic and other brands have capitalised on Kristen Wiig’s Bridesmaids one-liner “Help Me, I’m Poor”.In past PR scandals, retailers have often claimed that any offence was entirely accidental that they did not anticipate the meaning that many people from, say, Liverpool would draw from its red 96 top (the retailer said it was designed as a reference to a 1996 Bob Marley remix). Slogan tops that glamorise words clearly linked with poverty, however, can claim no such defence. Rather, Charis Thompson, a professor of sociology at LSE, advises that in order to understand this phenomenon, we need to ask: “Who is buying these items? Is it lower-income people in defiance or pride? Or is it middle-class consumers ‘slumming it’ to be cool?” T-shirts with slogans such as “working class” and “unemployed” appear to be the fast-fashion equivalent of a trend that has permeated luxury fashion for decades. It’s an exhausted obsession with the aesthetics of the council estate – one which is frequently appropriated by retailers and consumers who, if they can afford it, don’t have knowledge of the lived pain behind it. Dozens of brands have used the aesthetics of the working classes to sell three or four-figure products. Vetements even describes its cotton-mix tracksuit trousers as “chav lounge pants” (which retail at £500), while Nordstrom’s imitation workers’ jeans, designed to look like the wearer has just finished a day’s work on a construction site, are another case in point – they cost $425 (£313). What plasterer’s son could – or would? – fork out for those? Burberry – a brand which, in the noughties, embarked on a comprehensive campaign to rid its check prints of their association with so-called “chav culture” – has recently embraced that check again, collaborating with Gosha Rubchinskiy on a range that revels in Burberry check and sees jackets retail for £1,095.At the more affordable end of the scale, the trend was evident in the rise of the Nu-Lads movement in men’s fashion, with sportswear brands that had been long associated with “council-estate chic” finding new life as a sort of counter-movement to the hipster fad. Even more recently, in what must be the most offensive example of poverty-porn fashion yet, Puma threw a “House of Hustle” PR party inspired by council estate drug dealing. One London social worker, Amber Gilbert Coutts, wrote an open letter to Puma condemning the glamorisation of “exacerbated deprivation and community pain”. All this feels particularly distasteful when you consider the much-documented human cost of fast fashion. As recently as 2015, H\u0026ampM was found to be paying female workers a pittance in Cambodia, and in 2016 it was found to be using 14-year-old workers in Myanmar. Garments emblazoned with words such as “Unemployed” make their very existence a punchline.Writer and campaigner Paris Lees, who became the first trans woman in Britain to be featured in British Vogue earlier this year, made an appearance on BBC Question Time recently wearing hoop earrings and a tight ponytail – a look she describes as “council estate chic”. It’s a look she knows well, having grown up on one. “It just makes me laugh seeing all these posh people in east London spending loads of money to look like poor kids like me did in the 90s and 00s,” Lees says. “I mean, it’s a bit classless isn’t it, wearing a T-shirt saying you’re unemployed if you know you’ve got the safety net of a nice middle-class family and a decent university degree? The poorest and most vulnerable people in society are being hit hardest by the current economic and political regime, and it’s not funny, trendy or ironic. It’s a very real struggle just to survive.”Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, a constituency in which the  reported that almost half of children grow up below the poverty line, agrees: “Problems of poverty and unemployment are serious, complex ones, and trivialising them by adorning them on premium clothes seeks to help no one other than the companies that are selling them – often at eye-watering prices.” For many others in constituencies such as Thewliss’s, the word “unemployed” can evoke a visceral, even existential, fear. It’s a label few working-class people would embrace, especially when the tabloid media demonises unemployed working-class people as welfare cheats and scroungers.Broadly, the Vice channel, reported last year that socialist memes have become social currency for young people (we can largely thank Jeremy Corbyn for that). If Marxism is the new millennial buzzword, it makes sense that the youth want to distance themselves from wealth. As we have seen from the popularity of the oft-reported notion of the “oppression Olympics” – groups of people competing to be more hard-done-by than the other – it turns out that there is a lot of social capital in being poor in 2018. However, while many may read slogans such as “unemployed” and “working class” as cutesy, conscientious objections to capitalism, or reminders of their gap years, for many working-class people – for whom being unemployed is a life-threatening instability – having them stamped in black letters is just a crude iteration of exploitation by the fashion industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d44792164946af539f8e834cbc38bb80abea549/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9946e35183a6ed1d54bad0ea3b354b3d","title":"lean on pete review horse wild west andrew haigh","story":"A troubled teenager and his beloved old racehorse take to the big country in 45 Years director Andrew Haigh’s poignant adaptation of Willy Vlautin’s novel• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayAndrew Haigh’s sad and lovely new film Lean on Pete is adapted by him from the 2010 novel by American author and alt.country musician Willy Vlautin. It’s got the wonderfully easy, unforced naturalism and calm that distinguished his last two films, Weekend (2011) and 45 Years (2015). Things are taken mostly at a walking pace, a measured, controlled tempo, like someone carefully leading an injured horse. That doesn’t mean to say there aren’t some dramatic and violent moments, including a fateful highway incident, fabricated brilliantly but unobtrusively with digital effects, that had me clasp both hands over my mouth in shock.A lonely teenage boy, Charlie (Charlie Plummer) finds himself one summer in a dilapidated house in Portland, Oregon, having been uprooted from his Washington state hometown, where despite his poor background he had been a good student and promising track star. He’s right back to square one now, and the move evidently has something to do with a broken home. His mom is no longer in the picture and his handsome wastrel of a dad, Ray (Travis Fimmel), is a shiftless guy who brings home a different woman every night. Charlie finds transient work at a nearby racecourse, working for a seedy and unscrupulous horse trainer called Del (Steve Buscemi) who is too bad tempered and cynical to be even an ironic father figure.Charlie is entranced by the excitement and exotic rituals of horse training he befriends Del’s jockey, Bonnie (Chloë Sevigny), and mutely sympathises with her stoic complaints about this corrupt and misogynistic scene. Both Bonnie and Del are amused and yet worried about Charlie becoming so infatuated by a world that can only end for him in the heartbreak and failure they see in their own lives.And Charlie finds himself falling for Del’s sweet-natured and biddable racehorse Lean on Pete. This equable beast is very good for teaching newbies like Charlie – Del brutally calls him a “pussy”. But he is also, ominously, getting slower. Losers like Lean on Pete get sold to horseflesh dealers in Mexico, a fate that doesn’t need to be spelled out. And when Pete becomes injured one afternoon – Charlie abbreviates his name in a way that poignantly emphasises reliability and strength – horse and boy become runaways.The movie takes us across some classic American landscape but it isn’t quite in the tradition of Larry McMurtry or Cormac McCarthy – nor is it like, for example, Chloé Zhao’s recent film The Rider. Importantly, Charlie can’t and won’t ride Lean on Pete. In fact, the theme of the poverty-stricken youngster finding friendship, love and transcendent dignity in the company of a martyred animal is part of a different tradition – the British social realist line stretching from Ken Loach’s Kes to Clio Barnard’s The Selfish Giant. In some ways, the British film-maker Haigh has exported this style to the American West. Lean on Pete has an alt.socialrealist twang. But where his movie departs from that style is in the construction of narrative, and the unexpected way in which the relationship of horse and boy is perhaps not as central and dominant as we might otherwise expect. The meaning and presence of Lean on Pete is mysterious. I found myself thinking about the donkey in Robert Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar (1966).Haigh has a masterly way with mood and moment, with the play of light on a scene, and with a robust shift from fierce sunshine to sombre night-time. Everything looks scuffed, worn, broken down perhaps the only things that are cared for are the furniture and fittings of the diners that Del and Charlie show up in. Del’s horses are trained by being made to walk in a circle attached to a rotating maypole contraption that looks ironically like one of the rides at the tatty old fairground races where Lean on Pete usually runs.Plummer gives an excellent performance: watchful, sensitive, delicate and yet possessed of a survivor’s impassive quality. Fimmel is also very good in a role that is perhaps smaller than I expected. Buscemi is as robust and confident as ever and Steve Zahn is also strong in a small role as a homeless alcoholic guy. My only slight reservation is that Lean on Pete, though running to an affecting conclusion, maybe doesn’t deliver the final sting or narrative turn that marked out his previous film, 45 Years. Yet perhaps its simplicity and plainness is the whole point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5020f6bd8514329b93d6d348365d451db57ce89/1090_151_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c3c33f6babcd0d62f78c9c6590e1ace","title":"theres this idea that mothers are completely selfless diablo cody on tully and the juno backlash","story":"The Oscar-winning writer’s new film is about an exhausted mother slowly unravelling. She talks about the impact of motherhood, facing middle-age – and what she’d now change about JunoMotherhood isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Or at least it isn’t black and white, more of a stretched, washed-out, flesh-coloured maternity-bra shade inbetween, according to screenwriter Diablo Cody’s new film Tully. A decade on from her Academy Award-winning teen pregnancy rom-com Juno, Cody has created another lead who is expecting, this time turning Charlize Theron into baggy-eyed mum Marlo, who is one frozen pizza dinner away from the edge. She shouts. She accidentally drops an iPhone on her baby’s head. She slumps in front of her children, post-birth belly hanging out, much to their horror. Deflated, running on empty, she resembles a whoopee cushion being sat on in slow motion. Parenting has never looked so relatable.Cody, 39, says she is a different Diablo from the one who sashayed down the 2008 Oscars red carpet in head-to-toe leopard print to collect her award for Juno’s screenplay. She wrote the rom-com in a month while sitting in Starbucks, and it took her from part-time stripper-blogger to star overnight. Her projects since Juno haven’t quite matched that film’s pop culture-puncturing potential: Megan Fox horror dud Jennifer’s Body a Spielberg-produced TV series, United States of Tara, which lasted three seasons underrated rock comedy Ricki and the Flash brilliant but cancelled Amazon Prime series One Mississippi, which she co-created with standup Tig Notaro. But one aspect that has remained constant is her focus on creating female characters that defy the ordinary. Meryl Streep’s ageing rocker in 2015’s Ricki and the Flash, based on Cody’s mother-in-law, was particularly important – “a woman who had chosen to pursue her passion at the expense of her children, and she was viewed as a monster because of that,” she says. “We’re surrounded by men who have made that choice and are not demonised in the same way.”Tully is the third film in her trilogy with Jason Reitman, and the second with Theron after Young Adult, and again offers a view on the female experience that Cody rarely sees onscreen. And so there are money issues, a sexless marriage with a fairly useless husband, the exasperation at not knowing how to care for a young son with undiagnosed special needs. Sensing her desperation, Marlo’s brother buys the baby shower gift that every strained mother dreams of: help. Tully is a night nanny who breezily glides in, all toned abs and tanned limbs, to do the twilight shift so Marlo can rest. She’s a Manic Pixie Dream Girl version of Maria von Trapp, but also a device to help Marlo question what parts of herself have been lost under the tummy-huggers.Cody can relate. After having kids, she says, the question of “How do you access the person that you once were?” is something she grapples with. “I feel like a completely different human being on a cellular level since having children.” Not just through a loss of identity – in the film, Marlo is also suffering from postnatal depression, which Cody says there’s still a stigma around. She doesn’t say whether she had post-natal depression herself but does confirm she felt “that emptiness” for a while. “We’re told that we should feel completely blissed out after we have a baby, and that’s not always how women feel. It comes down to this idea that mothers are supposed to be completely selfless and if you’re indulging feelings of sadness or depression, that could be perceived by other people as selfish.”Tully isn’t just about parenting, however: “It’s about the great and intense transformation of middle age. It’s waking up and going: ‘Oh my God, I’m 40 – what happened?’” Is she feeling apprehensive about that coming milestone? “Yeah, and it’s strange. For years I’ve been regarded as ‘a young screenwriter’, or someone who has achieved a lot for her age. But no one’s going to give you a cookie for achieving something at 40. At this point, the pressure’s on me to perform and to sustain that. And also, we all know how older women are regarded, particularly in Hollywood. So it’s a little scary to think: ‘Oh, I will be discarded – that’s going to happen.’”Talking to Cody about these pressures, you wonder why she hasn’t been much involved in the wider public conversation about women in Hollywood that has occurred in the past year. Reading old interviews with her, Cody was outspoken and outraged, but recently her voice has been eerily absent she quit Twitter in 2015 and hasn’t considered rejoining. “I’ve been expressing my viewpoint in my art for more than a decade now, so everybody knows that I’m a feminist,” she says. “I don’t think my voice would’ve been valuable in that conversation because, honestly, I don’t think Twitter is desperate for another quirky white woman spouting her opinion. Let’s hear from voices we don’t hear from.”Still, she is encouraged by the Time’s Up movement, even if she initially doubted its staying power. “I’m such a cynic that, when it first started happening, I was on a group text with a lot of my girlfriends, and they were all so excited and I was like: ‘This won’t last. Men in power are going to shut this down so fast.’ And then it didn’t, it just grew and grew. So I’m glad that I was proven wrong.”Cody says she is “heartened” too by the progress that Hollywood is making with “the types of roles that are being written for women. When I started out, a TV show or a film about a difficult woman was a hard sell, and now it’s something that people are soliciting from me.” But she finds it frustrating that women aren’t allowed to fail in the same way as men. “It drives me crazy that if a woman directs a movie and it doesn’t perform, people say: ‘Oh, they shouldn’t have let a woman direct it.’” . Cody’s own directorial debut, the 2013 comedy drama Paradise, was made while she was pregnant, and was subsequently panned by critics. “If a man directs a movie and it flops, there’s literally no discussion of the director’s gender,” she adds. “As a woman in a field where women are underrepresented, you often feel like you are representing women, and that’s ridiculous.”With Tully, Cody does seem to have come full circle since Juno. Knowing what she knows now about childbirth, would she have done anything about her first film differently? “In terms of pregnancy, no,” she says. “But I don’t feel I was clear enough in terms of why Juno chose to not have an abortion. It was simply because she did not want to.”The film was criticised by some for portraying abortion in a “negative” light. “It was not about any type of feeling that abortion was wrong – I’m pro-choice,” Cody says. “So for it to be interpreted as an anti-choice movie, that’s upsetting to me.”The Juno backlash is one reason that she has become “more private”. She refuses to self-censor – “it hasn’t affected my writing” – but says: “It’s certainly affected the way that I talk to people about the projects. I’ve become very boring because I want to protect myself and my children. I would like to just keep a low profile and continue to work, and I’ve had to really stay under the radar in order to accomplish that.”It’s depressing that a forthright person such as Cody has been forced to retreat from the public eye. But, like Marlo, she sees a “joy” in embracing a life more ordinary. “I take great pride in my boring life, because it’s not easy for me to be sedate. I’m a naturally curious, impulsive, self-destructive person. And I’ve had to put all that aside as a mum. I’m proud of that because it’s required a lot of discipline.”• Tully is released on 4 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855eef761844d28ccaa14b2d0ded894fd46ac057/47_0_1407_844/master/1407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89de4d030a66c10e0c5318e076535712","title":"why polish gangster films on steroids are making it big at the british box office","story":"With titles such as Pitbull and Mafia Women, violent Polish-language thrillers are proving a cult success – some even denting the UK top 10. But can they win over mainstream audiences?• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayIt is a late Saturday afternoon in Walthamstow, north-east London, and business is slow at the Empire cinema, as it usually is on hot days. Nevertheless, 13 people have chosen a brutal thriller over an extra few hours in the sun. Pitbull: Last Dog, which opened the previous weekend on 279 screens, will have escaped the attention of most cinemagoers. It’s certainly more stomach-churning than the average multiplex fare. One woman has her throat slashed in the first five minutes another is placed under a carpet and then beaten violently with belts by a gang of thugs. A dead man is shot in the mouth at point-blank range, while a gangster pouring acid on a corpse tells his cohort charmingly: “If you make it without puking, I’ll buy you a whore.”Pitbull: Ostatni pies (Pitbull: Last Dog) is the latest in a run of films to have dented the UK box office top 10 despite being marketed exclusively at the Polish community. (At the time of writing it has taken around £340,000.) This year has already brought one hit, Kobiety mafii (Mafia Women), which took almost £900,000 in the UK and Ireland. Last year, the grisly 18-rated medical drama Botoks amassed £1.06m, making it not only the third highest-grossing foreign-language release of 2017 (after Park Chan-wook’s The Handmaiden and the Bollywood hit Raees) but the most successful Polish film ever in the UK.Like Bollywood, Polish cinema has flourished in UK multiplexes rather than arthouses, without any help from the British media. It is only partly true to say that the mainstream press has ignored these releases what’s more significant is that its attention and approval were never sought in the first place. With Polish now the second most commonly spoken language in England, English-speaking viewers are not part of this particular success story.The audience members I talk to after Pitbull: Last Dog are both Polish, though neither is especially impressed by what they have just seen. “It’s not as good as the other ones,” says Tomasz, a 40-year-old draughtsman and fan of the two previous Pitbull instalments. “This one is softer, more American. In Polish, we would say grubymi nićmi szyte – ‘stitched with a thick thread’. It hangs together, but only just.” Maciej, a 41-year-old veterinary surgeon, hasn’t seen a Polish film in a cinema since coming to live in the UK 12 years ago. “It was like it was on steroids,” he laughs. “It just showed all the different ways you could kill someone. I couldn’t follow what was going on.” Did it reflect anything about Polish life or culture? “I hope not. If it’s like that, I don’t want to go back.”Awareness of these movies is raised largely through social media and websites, and by the hoopla surrounding the initial premieres back in Poland (Pitbull: Last Dog was released there a month ago and enjoyed the second-biggest opening weekend of any native film this year). But what are Polish viewers here getting from these movies that they can’t get from the mainstream US equivalents? “There’s a certain mix of humour and toughness and a real eastern European vibe which Polish audiences like,” says Joanna Michalec, director of Phoenix Productions, the leading international distributor of Polish films. “I think they also like seeing Poland in a movie, and what’s important is they can go to a normal multiplex and see these films in Polish. That means a lot.”The mainstay of Polish cinema is director Patryk Vega, a Guy Ritchie-style figure responsible for every gory, high-octane success to date with the exception of the latest Pitbull. But not all of Phoenix’s films are violent. It also does a roaring trade in romantic comedies: Narzeczony na Niby (Pretend Fiance) is about to open, while the company had a hit two years ago with Planeta Singli (Planet Single), a lively Richard Curtis-style romcom centred on a dating app. Its Slovenian director, Mitja Okorn, currently lives in Los Angeles and recently finished making Life in a Year with Cara Delevingne and Jaden Smith for Will Smith’s Overbrook Entertainment.In June 2016, I attended a press screening of Planet Single introduced by Okorn, although it is unusual for non-arthouse Polish films to be shown to the press. “I was happy with the UK release, but I always want more,” he says now. “What I wanted was a bigger screening, a premiere where we could get even more UK opinion-makers and journalists to see the film. And that’s how we could slowly build a non-Polish UK audience that would become fans of good Polish cinema. For that to work, the distributors of Polish films would also need to be careful which movies they are distributing. The way it is now, they distribute everything – good, bad and extremely bad. Polish people confuse successful with good.”Can Polish cinema draw English-speaking audiences – and does that even matter? “Absolutely it matters,” says Sweeney. “It’s an untapped market that we’re trying to get into. We want to reach those viewers who are perfectly happy to watch foreign films.” The problem is that the sort of Polish movies put out by Phoenix are very different from the arthouse kind. No one is going to mistake Botoks for Ida, Paweł Pawlikowski’s haunting 2014 Oscar-winner, and Vega is no Krzysztof Kieślowski.With that in mind, Phoenix is planning to widen its slate to feature highbrow releases as well as, say, the forthcoming Kobiety mafii sequels. “We’re looking at projects geared toward lovers of foreign films in Britain,” says Michalec. “We have one in the pipeline that’s a Polish-British production aimed at arty audiences who tend to avoid the multiplexes.” If Brexit is causing the company any jitters, Michalec is hiding it well. “I don’t think many Polish people will move out. I can’t see it. The community is very settled.”Asked about his goals for the future, Sweeney doesn’t miss a beat. “My aim is simple,” he says. “A Bafta for best foreign language film.”Pitbull: Last Dog is on release. Narzeczony na Niby (Pretend Fiance) is released on 4 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3caa9747a9e2b779c91ab3aca12c03c4e63e1fc/0_147_4147_2489/master/4147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4898c7b9415d5783446d3970082943e8","title":"liverpool real madrid spanish press champions league final","story":"The Spanish media, unsurprisingly, is mostly backing Madrid – ‘The final could be most unequal in a decade’ – but Catalonia’s El Mundo Deportivo hopes ‘Hero Klopp’ can deny the holdersAnd so, it is a repeat of the 1981 European Cup final between Liverpool and Real Madrid, only there is virtually no way this will be a repeat of that. Watch it back and it is awful: a dirty, disjointed game of barely any passes, even fewer chances and pretty much no football, played on a pitch that was embarrassingly bad. It finished 1-0 when the Liverpool left-back Alan Kennedy scored the only goal. It is hard to imagine that being repeated this time round: these two teams survived semi-finals that finished 7-6 and 4-3.The balance has changed too. Back then Liverpool were favourites, playing their third final in five years, while Madrid had not been there in 15 years this time Madrid are playing their fourth final in five years and Liverpool their first in 11. In the pages of Marca, five journalists gave their verdict on the question: “Are Madrid favourites?” Four said yes the one that said no, perhaps because someone had to, offered inexperience as a quality. “No one in the Liverpool team has lifted the cup, which is motivation,” Samuel García wrote.Marca reports on “the goal machine” that will face Madrid but, while there is little doubt that Liverpool have done something special, that does not necessarily mean they win the Champions League. Most in Spain think they will not – and all the more so after Wednesday night in Rome. The Catalan sports daily El Mundo Deportivo lead on “Hero Klopp”, and they cling to him, but for them to really embrace him he must beat Madrid. “Liverpool are finalists but they sow doubts,” ran the headline in Sport. Not least because Madrid are, well, Madrid. And, according to Guillem Balagué in AS, there is something familiar about them. “Liverpool score before games have been defined,” he wrote. “It turns out that RM do just the same.”Julian Ruiz in El Mundo said: “It’s hard for Madrid fans to know if they can beat Liverpool. But I’m an optimistic realist and I think Madrid are virtual winners already. Why? Because Liverpool will be crushed by Madrid’s legend. Beating them is like beating the Invincibles, although Klopp thinks Zidane’s Madrid is a giant with feet of clay and there’s some sense in that.”Ismael Monzon wrote in the same newspaper: “When four long-haired lads got together to play in rough gaffs in Liverpool, someone saw them and said: ‘These guys have talent.’ Half a century later, Jürgen Klopp, aware that no one likes rigidity and conformity in the city, did the same. He let them strum their guitars and go out and play with the brakes off.“It’s curious that this band is dominated by one of the best orchestra directors in international football and that the fifth Beatle – the irony of globalisation – is an Egyptian called Mohamed. But Salah wasn’t the executioner of his former team this time he let the Mané be the soloist.”At the other end, though, it is a different story. “They say that defence is the best attack and the old adage reflects the state of things in this unbalanced Liverpool team,” wrote Diego Torres in El País. “Klopp’s greatest achievement has been building a super-competitive team with a second-rate defence and a limited midfield made up of serious, professional players but with no class and little invention.“Surprisingly it was enough, because every time the ball flew into Karius’s area, the alarm bells rang. The team that challenges Madrid in Kiev travels with a reckless defence. The final in Kiev looks like being the most unequal in a decade.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/460a6684928859e4590858870dddd8258268bb3c/0_361_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3312552ee270eb71f3a25464c6416e58","title":"atletico madrid v arsenal europa league semi final second leg live","story":"Hello. We are gathered here today to see whether Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal can muster at least one last heroic exploit. The smart money says no but the dreamers have hope. Sure, Arsenal missed a glorious opportunity last week when their defence disintegrated in all too familiar fashion and they conceded a late equaliser to Atletico’s 10 men but atoning for that today and turning the tie around is not beyond them, in theory. And what a happy ending that would set up for Wenger, who would have a chance to finally lift a European trophy, in his native France to boot, and possibly against Marseille, the club whose skulduggery nearly three decades ago perhaps cost him a title and contributed to him leaving his homeland (and dear Boro Primorac retreating into the shadows). All together now:♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ “It’s the wheel of fortune  It’s the leap of faith  it’s the band of hope … in the circle, the circle of life!” ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬And now for some hard facts: to win this tie without a penalty shootout Arsenal will have to score at least twice against a defence and goalkeeper that hardly seem like flesh and blood, more like concrete and barbed wire. Atletico are unbeaten in their last 17 home matches in La Liga and have not even conceded in the last 11 of those. Then again, they have not hosted many opponents who have an offensive armoury on a par with Arsenal’s and they did lose 2-1 at home to Chelsea in September and then even conceded to Qarabag, who made off with a 1-1 draw. And Sevilla won 2-1 at the Estadio politano in January to knock Atletico out of the Spanish Cup. So rumours of Atletico’s home invincibility may have been exaggerated. Arsenal could definitely score today. Whether their flaky defence can keep out Atletico is another matter entirely.Arsenal’s record in European semi-finals will have as much bearing on this match as it does on the behaviour of Sagittarius A, the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, 26,000 light years from earth. But let’s mention it any way: Arsenal have never lost a European semi-final to continental opposition: they have beaten Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Sampdoria, Lens and Villarreal in semi-finals before being battered by Manchester United in the last four of the 2009 Champions League. Atletico, meanwhile, won this tournament in 2010 and 2012 and have been to two of the last three Champions League finals. They have a nous and resolve that Arsenal seldom show, as well as some very fine players: they are heavy favourites for a reason.

I can confidently say I’ve never, even in the darkest days of school dinners, met anyone who doesn’t like crumble.Of course, you can stash just about any fruit you like under that buttery, sugary topping – though as Jesse Dunford Wood notes in his book Modern British Food, not all are appropriate – but the natural astringency of rhubarb, an underrated vegetable-identifying-as-a-fruit that fills the hungry gap between autumn apples and the first summer fruits, is the perfect complement, and a time-honoured partner for a jug of custard. (Dunford Wood also has strong opinions about the correct accompaniments to the crumble. He correctly identifies custard as the ideal).When I asked for recipe recommendations for this column, someone scornfully responded, “Who uses a recipe for crumble?” They’re right: anyone can make a decent rhubarb crumble. But how do you make a perfect one?Cookery writers and chefs, including the great Jane Grigson, tend to be snooty about outdoor rhubarb – “fat and stringy monsters, mostly all green and with just the faint remembrance of pink”, as Simon Hopkinson memorably puts it in Second Helpings Of Roast Chicken – but I suspect that’s as much to do with its unremarkable looks as its flavour. The spindly, blushing-pink stalks of January and February are easy for the camera to love, while the olive trunks as thick as a terrier’s ankle are far less Instagram-friendly. They still taste great, however – and, as one of the easiest things to grow in pots that I know, deserve a bit more love from us ingrates in the food media.You’ll need to sweeten the filling somehow, but don’t go overboard: the key to success is to maintain the contrast between tangy fruit and sweet topping. The neutral sweetness of white sugar is ideal here, to allow the rhubarb to shine, but seeing as I’m using demerara in the topping, it makes sense to stick with that here, too.For some reason, rhubarb has gained a reputation as a fruit that pairs well with strawberries. I’m instinctively repulsed by the idea, but after reading in the Riverford book that “Jane used to think that cooking strawberries was an abomination, but this combination came as a very pleasant surprise”, I’m prepared to give it a whirl. Turns out it’s not just me: everyone hates it. Perhaps it’s just too early in the season, but the baked strawberries have an odd, mushy texture, and very little flavour at all. Always nice to have one’s prejudices confirmed.The apple and rhubarb combination suggested by Anna Jones in her first book, A Modern Way To Cook, proves more popular, though using them in a 1:1 ratio means the softer rhubarb has a tendency to get lost among the more solid chunks of apple. If you must mix your fruits, however, this is probably the best option.One thing that does go with rhubarb is ginger: Iyer grates fresh root into her filling, and also adds orange zest and juice, as does Jones. I like the ginger in particular, but some testers find it a bit fiery, so I’m going to leave it out, while recommending anyone who enjoys the warming heat of ginger should be brave enough to give it a try.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recommends pairing rhubarb with sweet cicely: “As well as adding a lovely, aromatic edge to a dish, the aniseedy leaves make tart fruits seem sweeter, which means you can use less sugar.” Sadly, I don’t happen to have any in the garden, but if you do, this might also be a good option. I’m less sure about Gregg Wallace’s rhubarb and port idea, but if anyone else has time to try it, I’d love to hear your thoughts.Dunford Wood may be right in thinking that tropical fruits have no place in a crumble, but he loses some credibility with his attempts to take back control by cooking the two elements separately: “fewer soggy crumble issues and more consistency with the fruity filling, I find.” This is disappointing indeed: as Baxter’s second rule of crumble states, “Never cook the two parts separately or deconstruct the crumble in any way. This is an abomination.” (Like cooked strawberries, in fact.)Delicious as Dunford Wood’s biscuity, crunchy, honey-sweet topping is, it lacks the wonderfully soggy layer that forms as the fruit steams beneath one of the hallmarks of a proper crumble, we all agree. If you want a fancy, restaurant-style dish, by all means follow his lead, but make sure you serve it with crème anglaise, rather than besmirching the noble name of Bird’s with such foolishness. (And if you want your crumble in a hurry, Anna Jones’ super-quick pan version, which can be put together in less than 15 minutes, is an excellent version.)Many recipes add oats or ground almonds to their crumble mixtures. Both have their fans – and their downsides. Too many chewy, stodgy oats, and the topping becomes a flapjack more ground almonds than flour, and it falls apart at the first touch of the spoon (though the American website Chef Steps has a clever, flour-free version using ground almonds and egg yolks that may be of interest to coeliacs). The sweetness of almonds does go well with rhubarb, however, so I’ll be using a smaller proportion, and topping the dish with chopped almonds, an idea stolen from Jones, though I won’t be using coconut oil or sugar as she suggests. Far too exotic.Both dark and light brown sugars have their merits in this context, but we’re all smitten by the crunch of Dunford Wood’s demerara-flecked topping, even if it’s never seen a stick of rhubarb in its life. A proper school-style crumble should be satisfyingly solid, almost craggy, which requires a generous amount of butter and a splash of water to bring it together chill it before use to help it clump in the correct fashion.Iyer and Hopkinson both add ground ginger to their crumble mixture, Delia Smith sticks in cinnamon as well, Edd Kimber cardamom and Baxter crushed amaretti, but I think it’s delicious enough on its own. Serve with custard, preferably Bird’s, and preferably with a skin as thick as a rhinoceros hide, or plain ice-cream. Also delicious cold for breakfast.800g rhubarb40g demerara or white sugar 25g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped (optional)For the crumble topping150g plain flour 75g ground almonds170g chilled, unsalted butter, grated or diced75g demerara sugar¼ tsp saltHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.

Jackson and Olding, who both played for the Ireland and Ulster rugby union teams, had been suing BBC Northern Ireland, arguing the decision to report their arrests in November 2016 – before any charges had been brought – infringed their right to privacy. They also claimed that the broadcaster had not given them long enough to respond to a request for comment before publishing the story and raised concerns about how the information had been obtained.The BBC insisted its coverage was justified owing to the players’ high public profiles and said it had acted responsibly in handling the story.The proceedings against the BBC were initially launched in 2016 but had been put on hold pending the outcome of the criminal trial. After Jackson and Olding were unanimously cleared of all charges the rugby players initially indicated their intention to push ahead with the civil privacy case but instead decided to settle it at the high court in Belfast.Kathleen Carragher, the head of BBC News Northern Ireland, said she was pleased with the decision: “We argued throughout this case that our reporting was responsible, accurate, in the public interest and observed the BBC guidelines. “We are pleased that the players have accepted this outcome and have also agreed a contribution to our legal costs.”Jackson also accepted that judgment should be entered against him in a connected case involving the journalist Orla Bannon. She said her “journalism and integrity have been vindicated” by the rugby player’s decision.

By  Ben Tarnoff and  Moira WeigelBig Tech is sorry. After decades of rarely apologising for anything, Silicon Valley suddenly seems to be apologising for everything. They are sorry about the trolls. They are sorry about the bots. They are sorry about the fake news and the Russians, and the cartoons that are terrifying your kids on YouTube. But they are especially sorry about our brains.Sean Parker, the former president of Facebook – who was played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network – has publicly lamented the “unintended consequences” of the platform he helped create: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Justin Rosenstein, an engineer who helped build Facebook’s “like” button and Gchat, regrets having contributed to technology that he now considers psychologically damaging, too. “Everyone is distracted,” Rosenstein says. “All of the time.”Ever since the internet became widely used by the public in the 1990s, users have heard warnings that it is bad for us. In the early years, many commentators described cyberspace as a parallel universe that could swallow enthusiasts whole. The media fretted about kids talking to strangers and finding porn. A prominent 1998 study from Carnegie Mellon University claimed that spending time online made you lonely, depressed and antisocial.In the mid-2000s, as the internet moved on to mobile devices, physical and virtual life began to merge. Bullish pundits celebrated the “cognitive surplus” unlocked by crowdsourcing and the tech-savvy campaigns of Barack Obama, the “internet president”. But, alongside these optimistic voices, darker warnings persisted. Nicholas Carr’s The Shallows (2010) argued that search engines were making people stupid, while Eli Pariser’s The Filter Bubble (2011) claimed algorithms made us insular by showing us only what we wanted to see. In Alone, Together (2011) and Reclaiming Conversation (2015), Sherry Turkle warned that constant connectivity was making meaningful interaction impossible.Still, inside the industry, techno-utopianism prevailed. Silicon Valley seemed to assume that the tools they were building were always forces for good – and that anyone who questioned them was a crank or a luddite. In the face of an anti-tech backlash that has surged since the 2016 election, however, this faith appears to be faltering. Prominent people in the industry are beginning to acknowledge that their products may have harmful effects.Internet anxiety isn’t new. But never before have so many notable figures within the industry seemed so anxious about the world they have made. Parker, Rosenstein and the other insiders now talking about the harms of smartphones and social media belong to an informal yet influential current of tech critics emerging within Silicon Valley. You could call them the “tech humanists”. Amid rising public concern about the power of the industry, they argue that the primary problem with its products is that they threaten our health and our humanity.It is clear that these products are designed to be maximally addictive, in order to harvest as much of our attention as they can. Tech humanists say this business model is both unhealthy and inhumane – that it damages our psychological well-being and conditions us to behave in ways that diminish our humanity. The main solution that they propose is better design. By redesigning technology to be less addictive and less manipulative, they believe we can make it healthier – we can realign technology with our humanity and build products that don’t “hijack” our minds.The hub of the new tech humanism is the Center for Humane Technology in San Francisco. Founded earlier this year, the nonprofit has assembled an impressive roster of advisers, including investor Roger McNamee, Lyft president John Zimmer, and Rosenstein. But its most prominent spokesman is executive director Tristan Harris, a former “design ethicist” at Google who has been hailed by the Atlantic magazine as “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”. Harris has spent years trying to persuade the industry of the dangers of tech addiction. In February, Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of eBay, launched a related initiative: the Tech and Society Solutions Lab, which aims to “maximise the tech industry’s contributions to a healthy society”.As suspicion of Silicon Valley grows, the tech humanists are making a bid to become tech’s loyal opposition. They are using their insider credentials to promote a particular diagnosis of where tech went wrong and of how to get it back on track. For this, they have been getting a lot of attention. As the backlash against tech has grown, so too has the appeal of techies repenting for their sins. The Center for Humane Technology has been profiled – and praised by – the New York Times, the Atlantic, Wired and others.But tech humanism’s influence cannot be measured solely by the positive media coverage it has received. The real reason tech humanism matters is because some of the most powerful people in the industry are starting to speak its idiom. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has warned about social media’s role in encouraging “mindless scrambles for friends or unworthy distractions”, and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey recently claimed he wants to improve the platform’s “conversational health”.Even Mark Zuckerberg, famous for encouraging his engineers to “move fast and break things”, seems to be taking a tech humanist turn. In January, he announced that Facebook had a new priority: maximising “time well spent” on the platform, rather than total time spent. By “time well spent”, Zuckerberg means time spent interacting with “friends” rather than businesses, brands or media sources. He said the News Feed algorithm was already prioritising these “more meaningful” activities.Zuckerberg’s choice of words is significant: Time Well Spent is the name of the advocacy group that Harris led before co-founding the Center for Humane Technology. In April, Zuckerberg brought the phrase to Capitol Hill. When a photographer snapped a picture of the notes Zuckerberg used while testifying before the Senate, they included a discussion of Facebook’s new emphasis on “time well spent”, under the heading “wellbeing”.This new concern for “wellbeing” may strike some observers as a welcome development. After years of ignoring their critics, industry leaders are finally acknowledging that problems exist. Tech humanists deserve credit for drawing attention to one of those problems – the manipulative design decisions made by Silicon Valley.But these decisions are only symptoms of a larger issue: the fact that the digital infrastructures that increasingly shape our personal, social and civic lives are owned and controlled by a few billionaires. Because it ignores the question of power, the tech-humanist diagnosis is incomplete – and could even help the industry evade meaningful reform. Taken up by leaders such as Zuckerberg, tech humanism is likely to result in only superficial changes. These changes may soothe some of the popular anger directed towards the tech industry, but they will not address the origin of that anger. If anything, they will make Silicon Valley even more powerful.The Center for Humane Technology argues that technology must be “aligned” with humanity – and that the best way to accomplish this is through better design. Their website features a section entitled The Way Forward. A familiar evolutionary image shows the silhouettes of several simians, rising from their crouches to become a man, who then turns back to contemplate his history.“In the future, we will look back at today as a turning point towards humane design,” the header reads. To the litany of problems caused by “technology that extracts attention and erodes society”, the text asserts that “humane design is the solution”. Drawing on the rhetoric of the “design thinking” philosophy that has long suffused Silicon Valley, the website explains that humane design “starts by understanding our most vulnerable human instincts so we can design compassionately”.There is a good reason why the language of tech humanism is penetrating the upper echelons of the tech industry so easily: this language is not foreign to Silicon Valley. On the contrary, “humanising” technology has long been its central ambition and the source of its power. It was precisely by developing a “humanised” form of computing that entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs brought computing into millions of users’ everyday lives. Their success turned the Bay Area tech industry into a global powerhouse – and produced the digitised world that today’s tech humanists now lament.The story begins in the 1960s, when Silicon Valley was still a handful of electronics firms clustered among fruit orchards. Computers came in the form of mainframes then. These machines were big, expensive and difficult to use. Only corporations, universities and government agencies could afford them, and they were reserved for specialised tasks, such as calculating missile trajectories or credit scores.Computing was industrial, in other words, not personal, and Silicon Valley remained dependent on a small number of big institutional clients. The practical danger that this dependency posed became clear in the early 1960s, when the US Department of Defense, by far the single biggest buyer of digital components, began cutting back on its purchases. But the fall in military procurement wasn’t the only mid-century crisis around computing.Computers also had an image problem. The inaccessibility of mainframes made them easy to demonise. In these whirring hulks of digital machinery, many observers saw something inhuman, even evil. To antiwar activists, computers were weapons of the war machine that was killing thousands in Vietnam. To highbrow commentators such as the social critic Lewis Mumford, computers were instruments of a creeping technocracy that threatened to extinguish personal freedom.But during the course of the 1960s and 70s, a series of experiments in northern California helped solve both problems. These experiments yielded breakthrough innovations like the graphical user interface, the mouse and the microprocessor. Computers became smaller, more usable and more interactive, reducing Silicon Valley’s reliance on a few large customers while giving digital technology a friendlier face.The pioneers who led this transformation believed they were making computing more human. They drew deeply from the counterculture of the period, and its fixation on developing “human” modes of living. They wanted their machines to be “extensions of man”, in the words of Marshall McLuhan, and to unlock “human potential” rather than repress it. At the centre of this ecosystem of hobbyists, hackers, hippies and professional engineers was Stewart Brand, famed entrepreneur of the counterculture and founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. In a famous 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand called for a new model of computing that “served human interest, not machine”.Brand’s disciples answered this call by developing the technical innovations that transformed computers into the form we recognise today. They also promoted a new way of thinking about computers – not as impersonal slabs of machinery, but as tools for unleashing “human potential”.No single figure contributed more to this transformation of computing than Steve Jobs, who was a fan of Brand and a reader of the Whole Earth Catalog. Jobs fulfilled Brand’s vision on a global scale, launching the mass personal computing era with the Macintosh in the mid-80s, and the mass smartphone era with the iPhone two decades later. Brand later acknowledged that Jobs embodied the Whole Earth Catalog ethos. “He got the notion of tools for human use,” Brand told Jobs’ biographer, Walter Isaacson.Building those “tools for human use” turned out to be great for business. The impulse to humanise computing enabled Silicon Valley to enter every crevice of our lives. From phones to tablets to laptops, we are surrounded by devices that have fulfilled the demands of the counterculture for digital connectivity, interactivity and self-expression. Your iPhone responds to the slightest touch you can look at photos of anyone you have ever known, and broadcast anything you want to all of them, at any moment.In short, the effort to humanise computing produced the very situation that the tech humanists now consider dehumanising: a wilderness of screens where digital devices chase every last instant of our attention. To guide us out of that wilderness, tech humanists say we need more humanising. They believe we can use better design to make technology serve human nature rather than exploit and corrupt it. But this idea is drawn from the same tradition that created the world that tech humanists believe is distracting and damaging us.Tech humanists say they want to align humanity and technology. But this project is based on a deep misunderstanding of the relationship between humanity and technology: namely, the fantasy that these two entities could ever exist in separation.It is difficult to imagine human beings without technology. The story of our species began when we began to make tools. Homo habilis, the first members of our genus, left sharpened stones scattered across Africa. Their successors hit rocks against each other to make sparks, and thus fire. With fire you could cook meat and clear land for planting with ash you could fertilise the soil with smoke you could make signals. In flickering light, our ancestors painted animals on cave walls. The ancient tragedian Aeschylus recalled this era mythically: Prometheus, in stealing fire from the gods, “founded all the arts of men.”All of which is to say: humanity and technology are not only entangled, they constantly change together. This is not just a metaphor. Recent research suggests that the human hand evolved to manipulate the stone tools that our ancestors used. The evolutionary scientist Mary Marzke shows that we developed “a unique pattern of muscle architecture and joint surface form and functions” for this purpose.The ways our bodies and brains change in conjunction with the tools we make have long inspired anxieties that “we” are losing some essential qualities. For millennia, people have feared that new media were eroding the very powers that they promised to extend. In The Phaedrus, Socrates warned that writing on wax tablets would make people forgetful. If you could jot something down, you wouldn’t have to remember it. In the late middle ages, as a culture of copying manuscripts gave way to printed books, teachers warned that pupils would become careless, since they no longer had to transcribe what their teachers said.Yet as we lose certain capacities, we gain new ones. People who used to navigate the seas by following stars can now program computers to steer container ships from afar. Your grandmother probably has better handwriting than you do – but you probably type faster.The nature of human nature is that it changes. It can not, therefore, serve as a stable basis for evaluating the impact of technology. Yet the assumption that it doesn’t change serves a useful purpose. Treating human nature as something static, pure and essential elevates the speaker into a position of power. Claiming to tell us who we are, they tell us how we should be.Intentionally or not, this is what tech humanists are doing when they talk about technology as threatening human nature – as if human nature had stayed the same from the paleolithic era until the rollout of the iPhone. Holding humanity and technology separate clears the way for a small group of humans to determine the proper alignment between them. And while the tech humanists may believe they are acting in the common good, they themselves acknowledge they are doing so from above, as elites. “We have a moral responsibility to steer people’s thoughts ethically,” Tristan Harris has declared.Harris and his fellow tech humanists also frequently invoke the language of public health. The Center for Humane Technology’s Roger McNamee has gone so far as to call public health “the root of the whole thing”, and Harris has compared using Snapchat to smoking cigarettes. The public-health framing casts the tech humanists in a paternalistic role. Resolving a public health crisis requires public health expertise. It also precludes the possibility of democratic debate. You don’t put the question of how to treat a disease up for a vote – you call a doctor.This paternalism produces a central irony of tech humanism: the language that they use to describe users is often dehumanising. “Facebook appeals to your lizard brain – primarily fear and anger,” says McNamee. Harris echoes this sentiment: “Imagine you had an input cable,” he has said. “You’re trying to jack it into a human being. Do you want to jack it into their reptilian brain, or do you want to jack it into their more reflective self?”The Center for Humane Technology’s website offers tips on how to build a more reflective and less reptilian relationship to your smartphone: “going greyscale” by setting your screen to black-and-white, turning off app notifications and charging your device outside your bedroom. It has also announced two major initiatives: a national campaign to raise awareness about technology’s harmful effects on young people’s “digital health and well-being” and a “Ledger of Harms” – a website that will compile information about the health effects of different technologies in order to guide engineers in building “healthier” products.These initiatives may help some people reduce their smartphone use – a reasonable personal goal. But there are some humans who may not share this goal, and there need not be anything unhealthy about that. Many people rely on the internet for solace and solidarity, especially those who feel marginalised. The kid with autism may stare at his screen when surrounded by people, because it lets him tolerate being surrounded by people. For him, constant use of technology may not be destructive at all, but in fact life-saving.Pathologising certain potentially beneficial behaviours as “sick” isn’t the only problem with the Center for Humane Technology’s proposals. They also remain confined to the personal level, aiming to redesign how the inidual user interacts with technology rather than tackling the industry’s structural failures. Tech humanism fails to address the root cause of the tech backlash: the fact that a small handful of corporations own our digital lives and strip-mine them for profit. This is a fundamentally political and collective issue. But by framing the problem in terms of health and humanity, and the solution in terms of design, the tech humanists personalise and depoliticise it.This may be why their approach is so appealing to the tech industry. There is no reason to doubt the good intentions of tech humanists, who may genuinely want to address the problems fuelling the tech backlash. But they are handing the firms that caused those problems a valuable weapon. Far from challenging Silicon Valley, tech humanism offers Silicon Valley a useful way to pacify public concerns without surrendering any of its enormous wealth and power. By channelling popular anger at Big Tech into concerns about health and humanity, tech humanism gives corporate giants such as Facebook a way to avoid real democratic control. In a moment of danger, it may even help them protect their profits.One can easily imagine a version of Facebook that embraces the principles of tech humanism while remaining a profitable and powerful monopoly. In fact, these principles could make Facebook even more profitable and powerful, by opening up new business opportunities. That seems to be exactly what Facebook has planned.Zuckerberg said he expected those changes would continue to decrease total time spent – but “the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable”. This may describe what users find valuable – but it also refers to what Facebook finds valuable. In a recent interview, he said: “Over the long term, even if time spent goes down, if people are spending more time on Facebook actually building relationships with people they care about, then that’s going to build a stronger community and build a stronger business, regardless of what Wall Street thinks about it in the near term.”Sheryl Sandberg has also stressed that the shift will create “more monetisation opportunities”. How? Everyone knows data is the lifeblood of Facebook – but not all data is created equal. One of the most valuable sources of data to Facebook is used to inform a metric called “coefficient”. This measures the strength of a connection between two users – Zuckerberg once called it “an index for each relationship”. Facebook records every interaction you have with another user – from liking a friend’s post or viewing their profile, to sending them a message. These activities provide Facebook with a sense of how close you are to another person, and different activities are weighted differently. Messaging, for instance, is considered the strongest signal. It’s reasonable to assume that you’re closer to somebody you exchange messages with than somebody whose post you once liked.Why is coefficient so valuable? Because Facebook uses it to create a Facebook they think you will like: it guides algorithmic decisions about what content you see and the order in which you see it. It also helps improve ad targeting, by showing you ads for things liked by friends with whom you often interact. Advertisers can target the closest friends of the users who already like a product, on the assumption that close friends tend to like the same things.So when Zuckerberg talks about wanting to increase “meaningful” interactions and building relationships, he is not succumbing to pressure to take better care of his users. Rather, emphasising time well spent means creating a Facebook that prioritises data-rich personal interactions that Facebook can use to make a more engaging platform. Rather than spending a lot of time doing things that Facebook doesn’t find valuable – such as watching viral videos – you can spend a bit less time, but spend it doing things that Facebook does find valuable.In other words, “time well spent” means Facebook can monetise more efficiently. It can prioritise the intensity of data extraction over its extensiveness. This is a wise business move, disguised as a concession to critics. Shifting to this model not only sidesteps concerns about tech addiction – it also acknowledges certain basic limits to Facebook’s current growth model. There are only so many hours in the day. Facebook can’t keep prioritising total time spent – it has to extract more value from less time.In many ways, this process recalls an earlier stage in the evolution of capitalism. In the 19th century, factory owners in England discovered they could only make so much money by extending the length of the working day. At some point, workers would die of exhaustion, or they would revolt, or they would push parliament to pass laws that limited their working hours. So industrialists had to find ways to make the time of the worker more valuable – to extract more money from each moment rather than adding more moments. They did this by making industrial production more efficient: developing new technologies and techniques that squeezed more value out of the worker and stretched that value further than ever before.A similar situation confronts Facebook today. They have to make the attention of the user more valuable – and the language and concepts of tech humanism can help them do it. So far, it seems to be working. Despite the reported drop in total time spent, Facebook recently announced huge 2018 Q1 earnings of $11.97bn (£8.7bn), smashing Wall Street estimates by nearly $600m.Today’s tech humanists come from a tradition with deep roots in Silicon Valley. Like their predecessors, they believe that technology and humanity are distinct, but can be harmonised. This belief guided the generations who built the “humanised” machines that became the basis for the industry’s enormous power. Today it may provide Silicon Valley with a way to protect that power from a growing public backlash – and even deepen it by uncovering new opportunities for profit-making.Fortunately, there is another way of thinking about how to live with technology – one that is both truer to the history of our species and useful for building a more democratic future. This tradition does not address “humanity” in the abstract, but as distinct human beings, whose capacities are shaped by the tools they use. It sees us as hybrids of animal and machine – as “cyborgs”, to quote the biologist and philosopher of science Donna Haraway.To say that we’re all cyborgs is not to say that all technologies are good for us, or that we should embrace every new invention. But it does suggest that living well with technology can’t be a matter of making technology more “human”. This goal isn’t just impossible – it’s also dangerous, because it puts us at the mercy of experts who tell us how to be human. It cedes control of our technological future to those who believe they know what’s best for us because they understand the essential truths about our species.The cyborg way of thinking, by contrast, tells us that our species is essentially technological. We change as we change our tools, and our tools change us. But even though our continuous co-evolution with our machines is inevitable, the way it unfolds is not. Rather, it is determined by who owns and runs those machines. It is a question of power.Today, that power is wielded by corporations, which own our technology and run it for profit. The various scandals that have stoked the tech backlash all share a single source. Surveillance, fake news and the miserable working conditions in Amazon’s warehouses are profitable. If they were not, they would not exist. They are symptoms of a profound democratic deficit inflicted by a system that prioritises the wealth of the few over the needs and desires of the many.There is an alternative. If being technological is a feature of being human, then the power to shape how we live with technology should be a fundamental human right. The decisions that most affect our technological lives are far too important to be left to Mark Zuckerberg, rich investors or a handful of “humane designers”. They should be made by everyone, together.Rather than trying to humanise technology, then, we should be trying to democratise it. We should be demanding that society as a whole gets to decide how we live with technology – rather than the small group of people who have captured society’s wealth.What does this mean in practice? First, it requires limiting and eroding Silicon Valley’s power. Antitrust laws and tax policy offer useful ways to claw back the fortunes Big Tech has built on common resources. After all, Silicon Valley wouldn’t exist without billions of dollars of public funding, not to mention the vast quantities of information that we all provide for free. Facebook’s market capitalisation is $500bn with 2.2 billion users – do the math to estimate how much the time you spend on Facebook is worth. You could apply the same logic to Google. There is no escape: whether or not you have an account, both platforms track you around the internet.In addition to taxing and shrinking tech firms, democratic governments should be making rules about how those firms are allowed to behave – rules that restrict how they can collect and use our personal data, for instance, like the General Data Protection Regulation coming into effect in the European Union later this month. But more robust regulation of Silicon Valley isn’t enough. We also need to pry the ownership of our digital infrastructure away from private firms.This means developing publicly and co-operatively owned alternatives that empower workers, users and citizens to determine how they are run. These democratic digital structures can focus on serving personal and social needs rather than piling up profits for investors. One inspiring example is municipal broadband: a successful experiment in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has shown that publicly owned internet service providers can supply better service at lower cost than private firms. Other models of digital democracy might include a worker-owned Uber, a user-owned Facebook or a socially owned “smart city” of the kind being developed in Barcelona. Alternatively, we might demand that tech firms pay for the privilege of extracting our data, so that we can collectively benefit from a resource we collectively create.More experimentation is needed, but democracy should be our guiding principle. The stakes are high. Never before have so many people been thinking about the problems produced by the tech industry and how to solve them.

If we go backwards from frictionless border, then we really have lost from Brexit.”There will also have to be checks in Calais and other continental ports for British exports, meaning French diners may have to do without Scottish salmon or langoustines. Supplies of such foods from Scotland rotted on the roadside in 2015, the last time there were major delays in the ports.Keefe said the phytosanitary checks legally required on both sides of the border were a bigger challenge than the high-profile issue of customs checks that is currently iding the cabinet.“If we are all happy eating frozen meat then it’s an easy win, but if we want fresh food and having it on our shelves 365 days a year then it’s a big problem,” he said. “We export about £8bn of fresh produce a year and import £12-13bn. That amount of fresh produce going backwards and forwards is far more of a risk for the government than is anything of customs or duty.” Keefe said one problem was there were no existing border inspection posts to serve Folkestone and Dover, the gateway for the majority of fresh food supplies. It is estimated it could take between five and 10 years to put enough posts in place to deal with the volume of freight requiring phytosanitary inspection.Keefe called on the government to urgently draw up a plan of action, as he said it was estimated it could take “anything between five and 10 years to build border inspection posts to deal with the level of traffic coming across a short strait”.Representatives from the Dover Port and the Freight Transport Association had the same message. “It is the non-tariff barriers that could cause the bulk of delay,” said James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the FTA.Pauline Bastidon, the association’s head of European policy, told the conference: “Everything needs to be checked – animal products, animal feed, fruit and veg, raw meat, but also things like pot noodles and readymade meals with a little bit of meat.”There are border inspection posts at ports and airports that are hubs for non-EU goods, such as Heathrow, Felixstowe and the Thames Gateway, but none in Dover or Folkestone.The phytosanitary checks are a critical part of infection control to protect animals and the public and help stop the spread of everything from mad cow disease to Dutch elm disease.They are also a vital weapon in the battle against cases of food fraud like the horsemeat scandal in 2013, when beef burgers sold in several Irish and British supermarkets were found to contain mixed meat.The UK is not self-sufficient in food and relies on imports, an issue that farmers and food producers have said could lead to shortages of staples after Brexit. Richard Christian, the policy director at Dover, said delays from checks could lead to miles-long tailbacks at the port and in Calais. “We are open 364 days a year to keep the goods in the shops that we all enjoy. The second we stop that flow, that’s where we’ve got this problem,” he said. “The amount of time to process non-EU freight – on a good day it can take 20 minutes, it can take several hours, on a bad day it can take several days. Somehow we’ve got to get a few hours down to two minutes otherwise there will be a perpetual queue of 17 miles.”Several executives at the conference poured cold water on the government’s current proposed solution for the borders. Peter MacSwiney, the chair of Agency Sector Management, a freight specialist, described the proposed customs partnership as “ridiculous” as it would require French, Belgian and Dutch authorities to reciprocate. “Why would they invest in developing new IT systems to match ours when it was the UK that voted for Brexit, not them?” he said.

Or for his grasp of anything very much. But at Brexit questions in the Commons, he took his lack of awareness to new heights by seeming to forget there had been a meeting of the inner cabinet the previous day. He’s going to get a hell of a shock when someone gently informs him that not only was he there but he voted against the prime minister’s preferred customs partnership option. Before long he will be struggling to remember his own name. If only that were possible for the rest of us.Brexit questions used to guarantee a nearly full house in the chamber, but the number of MPs bothering to attend have now dwindled to a mere handful. There’s only so much futility anyone can take and most have long since decided there’s only a certain number of times they can slip through Davis’s looking-glass world before they don’t come back.Of those few – those unhappy few – who did decide to take one for the team and risk their mental health, almost all wanted an urgent update on the customs union. With the government no nearer to deciding what kind of future trading relationship it wants with the EU nearly two years after the referendum, time is running out to reach an agreement by October.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.“The customs union is a very complex issue,” said Davis, confidently channelling his inner Alice. “So it should be no surprise that it is taking a long time.” A few MPs began reaching for their medication. It was going to be a long hour. They didn’t need to be told how complicated it all was as they knew that already. The issue was that the government had taken so long to getting round to realise that fact for itself. Davis looked hurt by the criticism and insisted that, despite the customs partnership having been kicked into the long grass the previous day, the government was still actively considering both the customs partnership and a more streamlined model. “Both have their merits and their drawbacks,” he declared. One of which is that the EU has already in effect ruled both proposals out. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, looked at Davis with alarm and pity. Maybe now wasn’t the moment to get him up to speed.On and on Davis went, taking off his glasses, putting them on again and repeating the phrase “deep and special partnership” over and over again until it sounded meaningless even to him. “We are acting in the best interests of the country,” he said. Now it was the turn of the hardline Tory Brexiters to look confused. They had been certain the government was really just doing anything it could to keep them happy and to stay in power. Having talked himself round in circles to a position where everything was equally possible and impossible, Davis sat down and handed over to his junior minister. In a former life, Robin Walker may have been fully sentient, but his boss’s intellectual impairment has proved contagious and he can now barely string a sentence together.What did the people living on both sides of the Irish border think of the government’s proposed solutions, asked Labour’s Karin Smyth. “Um, er, um, er, everyone understands the importance of a frictionless border,” Walker mumbled. “Um, er, um, er, we’re still talking.” Though not in a language anyone but he and Davis understands. Walker was then asked what steps had been taken to find a technological solution to the Irish border. “None whatsoever,” he said proudly. Davis patted him on the back. That’s my boy.To general amazement and concern, Walker was made to look an intellectual giant by the arrival to the dispatch box of the department’s most recent ministerial recruit. Having dismissed the government’s own research into the economic impact of leaving the customs union as rubbish, Suella Braverman then made her big pitch for the future. Outer space. No matter that we can’t even solve the Irish border, Britain would conquer the universe and be a world leader in trade with Venus and Neptune. To infinity and beyond. Just another day in Brexit in Wonderland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/633add0bb836bec5fcab37626824c31c10ce825e/0_134_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e929c211f8e05939b9d06c5f54c28025","title":"uk voters turned away polling stations id trial","story":"Pilot scheme in five areas leads to people being unable to vote due to ‘ineligible’ identificationVoters have been turned away from polling stations in at least two of the five areas trialling the government’s controversial compulsory ID scheme, prompting concerns that some people are being disenfranchised.Angela Wilkins, the leader of the Labour group on Bromley council in south-east London, one of the boroughs involved in the pilot project, said four polling stations being used for the local elections on Thursday had told her that by 10.30am, they had already turned away five people between them for not having ID.“By that stage, there had been 25 votes at one of the stations, which could mean just 100 votes cast overall, and already five people turned away,” she said.“If that turns out to be the case, it’s a much higher rate of people having difficulties than anyone expected.”Ellie Reeves, the Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, an area that covers part of Bromley, described the pilot project as “plain wrong”.In Woking, another of the boroughs testing the scheme, a Labour councillor said a man was turned away because his form of ID, a Surrey county council document with his picture on it, was not accepted. “This gentleman turned up, showed his ID, which included a picture that was clearly him – it was an exact resemblance – but they wouldn’t accept it as it was not on the list of acceptable forms of ID,” Tahir Aziz said.Elsewhere in Woking, one voter said he had initially been told he could not use his rail photo pass as ID.Stuart Wilks-Heeg, an expert on electoral integrity at the University of Manchester, said he had observed three polling stations in Woking, spending at least an hour at each. Of 90 people arriving to vote, he saw two turned away.The pilot seemed to otherwise be running smoothly from what he saw, he said. “Polling station staff really well briefed and voters clearly knew about the requirements,” he said.The trial, which could lead to the idea being extended across England for future elections, means voters in Bromley, Woking and Gosport have to show photo ID, or two items showing their address from a list of approved documents. Those in Watford and Swindon must bring their polling cards, while there are separate tests connected to postal votes.The scheme has prompted concerns from charities and others that it could disenfranchise more vulnerable voters who are less likely to have access to the necessary ID, for example, older people and those who are homeless.Labour has also said it could unfairly affect those such as the Windrush generation, who do not have adequate documentation through no fault of their own.The Cabinet Office argues that it is necessary to prevent voter impersonation and voter ID has been recommended by the Electoral Commission.But critics have said it is an overreaction to a marginal problem, with none of the five trial boroughs having reported a single incident of voter impersonation over the past decade.A spokesman for the prime minister, asked about reports of some voters being turned away, said: “The overwhelming number of people are casting their vote without a problem. A great deal of work has been done in these pilot areas to prepare the public there. In places like Bromley, people will have had six pieces of direct mail about the pilot, and there has been a widespread poster campaign.“Voter ID has been piloted in a small number of locations. We’re working alongside local authorities to take an evidence-based approach on this pilot. The fact is, local authorities have told all voters they need to bring a form of ID in these pilot areas. ID can be something like a bus pass or a driver’s licence.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91df1cd4351136126dfe9337d2ad0b963448b009/0_44_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a83319ea5632cd89c90221612ac8854","title":"local elections 2018 polling day live","story":"Follow the latest developments as voters go to the polls in the biggest test for the political parties since the general election.Screenshots of an email sent out by Conservative campaign headquarters are being shared on Twitter and nobody is impressed with the contents.

In 23 cases the police found insufficient evidence to conclude their investigation, in 24 cases it was not possible to identify a suspect and in a further 4 cases it was found not to be a RPA offence.

Finnegan Pope-Carter, a company director from Shipley, near Bradford, said he arrived at a polling station at 8am and was asked for identification papers. He was eventually allowed to vote after fetching his driving licence from his car but his wife Chrys Harris, an archaeological geophysicist, was refused multiple times. “I didn’t have my polling card or a photo ID on me. I told them repeatedly that I did not need them either. They refused and said I did,” she told the Press Association. Harris said she almost gave up on casting her vote as the polling station clerks assisted other voters. “I stood my ground and finally they rang a superior who said I was allowed a ballot,” she said. The couple, both 29, described the experience as “very stressful”, but said that Bradford Council had assured them it would not happen again.A spokesman for Bradford Council said: We apologise to the very small number of voters concerned who were asked to provide ID to vote in one Shipley polling station today. We were alerted to the matter early this morning and it was dealt with immediately. To confirm, there is no requirement for voters to provide ID to cast a vote and a further message has been issued to all polling staff.Do leave comments about any stories you think we should cover on the blog, or tweet me @nadiakhomami.

However, she is adamant that Friday’s uphill finish on the Cow and Calf climb above Ilkley will not suit her, and that she is only a temporary race leader.In 2016 Wild won the inaugural women’s race here after the peloton swept up a rash lone attack from Lizzie Armitstead, and that knowledge stood her in good stead when several front runners followed a motorbike when it turned left into the race vehicle ersion instead of going right at the final roundabout with 800m to go.As others dodged through cones to get back on course, Wild’s team went to the front earlier than they expected, but she still sat pretty until the final crucial moment with all the sang-froid to be expected of a woman in her 15th racing season, heading inexorably for her 73rd race win.The key instant came as Doncaster’s South Parade veered gently to the right in the final 200 metres past the Town Fields. Here, the 2016 world champion Amalie Dideriksen – who deprived Wild of the gold medal in that year’s title in Qatar – was poised to lunge through a gap to Wild’s right, only for the 35-year-old to show her nous by moving briskly to close the door, leaving the young Dane with nowhere to go.On Friday, Wild will become a team rider working for Wiggle’s climbers, Elisa Longo-Borghini and Lisa Brennauer as the race heads for the hills around Otley and Pool in Wharfedale before the final two-kilometre climb on to the moors. It should also suit Great Britain’s Dani King, who had planned to target time bonuses on this flat stage, and landed four seconds which could prove useful in the final reckoning.On the largely flat roads of South Yorkshire, the stronger teams sat tight with Friday in mind, which left openings for the British squads. Trek-Drops sent Anna Christian ahead for the latter part of the stage while Jadan-Weldtite team gambled heavily by sending their junior Pfeiffer Georgi – currently the strongest under-18 woman in Europe – off from the gun. It was a move which netted the 17-year-old the only ranked climb of the day, and with it the Best Climber’s jersey, justifying her team’s presence in the race with just 40 miles covered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/329524cd5311510f753ae4dbbbc3584f3ed654c3/0_720_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1006311ddfc7db61976913809d02f5","title":"virat kohli surrey india series england","story":"Surrey have pulled off an almighty coup by signing of Virat Kohli, the Indian captain and cricket’s premier all-format batsman, for the whole of June.Kohli had originally declared his interest in playing county cricket ahead of India’s Test series in England this summer some 18 months ago. And now the 29-year-old will get his wish with a four-week spell that sees him grace the likes of Beckenham, Guildford and Scarborough.Hailed as “the biggest name in world cricket” by Surrey’s director of cricket, Alec Stewart, upon completion of the deal on Thursday, Kohli will be available to play in the club’s Royal London Cup matches during that month and three County Championship fixtures.It is the latter, of course, that interests him most as he looks to prevent a repeat of his last outing against the red Dukes ball when, back in 2014, he averaged 13.4 over five Tests as India went down 3-1 to England under the captaincy of MS Dhoni.Kohli, who will now skipper India’s one-off Test versus Afghanistan in mid June, said: “It has long been an ambition of mine to play county cricket. I am thankful to Alec Stewart and Surrey for allowing me the opportunity. I can’t wait to get to the Kia Oval.”Surrey have just one match at the ground during Kohli’s stay, with a 50-over fixture at home to Glamorgan on 6 June preceded by matches against Kent at Beckenham and Middlesex at Lord’s. His championship appearances will then be versus Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl, Somerset at Guilford and Yorkshire at Scarborough.The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, has previously bemoaned a lack of overseas opportunities for his players in first-class cricket and will doubtless have had a wry smile upon learning that Kohli will join the likes of Ishant Sharma (Sussex) and Cheteshwar Pujara (Yorkshire) in getting an early tune-up for the Test series that begins on 1 August.But Stewart said: “Playing and training alongside Virat will be a massive benefit for our players. At a time when there is much discussion around the future of county cricket, the arrival of Virat should give our domestic game a massive boost and positive exposure around the cricketing world.”Kohli’s move came on the same day that India permitted Dinesh Kathik and Hardik Pandya to play for the World XI in a one-off Twenty20 against West Indies at Lord’s on 31 May - a match that is raising money for hurricane-damaged stadia in the Caribbean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f09db6085f4acea1578a337d55910b5f9bd18c91/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98774c1f0878a71534333cf3285349b4","title":"big time sensuality bjork ballet rave puts san francisco under its spell unbound festival","story":"Arthur Pita’s show mixes eight of the Icelandic singer’s tracks into a cacophony of glamour, craziness and fairytale at the Unbound festival With 12 new works, two specially commissioned scores and the world’s first Björk ballet, the Unbound festival by San Francisco Ballet (SFB) properly lives up to its title. Yes, there may be some predictable names among the dozen commissioned choreographers yes, there are only two women among them. But artistic director Helgi Tomasson has undertaken an exhilarating experiment in California – challenging audiences to take a risk on four ambitious triple bills and challenging choreographers to cut loose and play.Arthur Pita has never needed permission to play. As delinquent and riotous as some of his choreography has been, the setting of eight Björk songs in Björk Ballet still looks like nothing he’s ever produced. Visually, the work is a cacophony of glamour, craziness and fairytale: the stage transformed into a gled salt marsh by 40 clumps of silver grass the dancers costumed by Marco Morante to become, variously, a tinsel-cloaked fairy with raspberry-pink socks, a tango a, a scarlet butterfly and a chorus of clubbers in sequined muzzles.There is a hint of a story in the fisherman figure who wanders through the piece, alternately wearing sad and happy clown masks. At moments he cast his line as if fishing for dreams, and it is perhaps those dreams that Pita hears in Björk’s music. The scenarios include a group of lovers, locked in an underwater embrace a sexy goddess carried on a bier and a classical rave. A stageful of ballet dancers pogoing in perfect first position to Hyperballad is a sight to see.Viewed as pure choreography, some sections may seem disposable, even random, but as a synthesis of dance, music and design it becomes far more than the sum of its parts. Unlike so many pop-inspired ballets, Pita doesn’t ride the surface novelty of Björk’s music. Instead, he communicates something of the transgression, yearning, mischief and magic at its heart. Evanescent though it may be, Björk Ballet is a wonderful watch – surprising, mysterious and a ridiculous amount of fun.Pita is one of four British or British-based choreographers to feature in Unbound, and while he and Christopher Wheeldon have worked with SFB before, David Dawson and Cathy Marston are making their company debuts. Marston’s Snowblind is the more substantial, an adaptation of Edith Wharton’s Ethan Frome, a bleak fable of love, possession and loss that proves a smart choice for a one-act ballet.Working with an arranged score by Philip Feeney, Marston whittles her material down to around 30 minutes of pure dance. She uses a modest-sized chorus to evoke the story’s crucial element of snow her drifting choreography not only its figurative representation but also of the claustrophobic situation in which three characters – Ethan, his wife, Zeena, and the free-spirited Mattie with whom he falls in love – are trapped. There is a superb chemistry between casting and choreography. Sarah Van Patten is terrifyingly good as Zeena – her hands clawed, her spine rigid and her gaze steely with possessiveness and pain. Mathilde Froustey’s Mattie is her quicksilver opposite, light, sensuous and supple. Ulrik Birkkjaer’s Ethan, his back bowed from years of dutiful service, develops poignant layers of rectitude and longing.Marston keeps her language plain and functional when she needs to move her story along, but it blooms vividly when focusing on the characters’ inner lives. In one finely judged image she has Mattie kneel and rest her head against Ethan’s leg, concentrating the spontaneity, sweetness and willingness that make her so lovable to him. When the errant lovers try to escape, and Mattie is paralysed in an accident, Marston masterfully tracks the changing dynamics of power in a trio that ends with the two lovers clasped in Zeena’s arms and Zeena triumphantly in charge.Snowblind is the only literary ballet to feature in the festival, but some of the most abstract-seeming works carry an implicit theme or personal story. Gender identity is subtly addressed in David Dawson’s Animus Anima, which plays with the traditional dynamics of male and female dance languages. In The Infinite Ocean, Edwaard Liang contemplates death in Bespoke, Stanton Welch meditates on the transience of a ballet career and in Wheeldon’s Bound To, a cast of mobile phone-clutching dancers tackle the world’s addiction to social media.Wheeldon doesn’t typically moralise as a choreographer, but this idea takes his work to some interestingly expressive places. When a phone-free Dores André tries to seduce Benjamin Freemantle into paying her proper attention, their duet becomes a cleverly evocative experiment in dysfunctional partnering she initiating the moves, while he absent-mindedly responds. An intricately fluid, intimate quartet has four women recalling a time when they used to talk rather than text while an affecting solo for Lonnie Weeks shows a man stranded in solitary anxiety, among a group of phone-transfixed friends.What’s odd is how little trust Wheeldon places in his own language. Each section comes with a title projected on to the stage – “Open your eyes” or “Take a deep breath” – and in tandem with Keaton Henson’s overly saccharine score, these preachy little captions seem to trivialise rather than concentrate the choreography’s message. Dance often works its deepest effects through the gaps and ambiguities of its language. In contrast to Wheeldon’s over-signalling, the charm of Trey McIntyre’s Your Flesh Shall Be a Great Poem lies in its willingness to let the audience find their own way into the material.The work is about McIntyre’s grandfather, who died after suffering years of dementia. Set to the waif-like folk songs of Chris Garneau, McIntyre’s choreography cleverly evokes the past without sentimentalising. Freemantle as the young grandfather dances among his male friends with a slightly stilted jocularity. He flirts with sweetly artless young women, and McIntyre adroitly captures their inidual vulnerabilities in the rawness of the characters’ steps and their eccentricities of phrasing. At the end, when Freemantle is left alone, dancing a strange, ragged duet with a three-legged stool, we glimpse the pain of the grandfather losing his mind and the choreographer trying to piece it back together.Flesh is a very personal work, authentic and generous these are qualities disappointingly absent from Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s Guernica. A homage to Picasso, it throws together sex, politics, cubism and Spain in a high-gloss spectacle of bull-horned lovers, flamenco and blood red lighting . It’s all too much and while I normally admire her work for its breadth of spirit, Guernica feels overwrought and hollow. It is marvellously danced, however, as are all the works in the festival. Even if there are moments when this elegant, versatile and committed company look as though they could have done with an extra rehearsal or two, it’s impressive how fully and deeply they embody the range of choreographic idioms that have been thrown at them.Standout performances include Angelo Greco, his moulded line and impassioned attack beautifully showcased in the pure neoclassicism of Welch’s Bespoke Yuan Yuan Tan, spooling her eerily graceful body though Liang’s Infinite Ocean Sofiane Sylve magnificently regal in just about everything and Maria Kochetkova as a ferocious modern-day Odile in Dawson’s Anima Animus.The company shine in Justin Peck’s Hurry Up We’re Dreaming, set to a sequence of tracks by M83 with 14 dancers dressed in trainers, shorts and jeans. Peck has a special genius for choreographing ensembles, creating surges and crosscurrents of dance that sparkle with brilliantly bevelled detail. The heart of this beautiful ballet lies in the long, quietly ecstatic duet for Sarah Van Patten and Luke Ingham – a sequence of low lifts, gently delineated balances, and unexpected changes of direction during which the two dancers seem to move together on a single breath.I saw all 12 works over a weekend, and in that concentrated viewing some of the festival’s choreographers appeared markedly braver than others. But overall these ballets constitute a fine statement of faith in the future of the art form. If I were Tomasson and cherry-picking my dream triple bill, Peck, Marston and Pita’s works would be frontrunners, but Wheeldon, Dawson and McIntyre’s would not be far behind. Lucky San Francisco, to be so spoiled for choice.• Unbound festival runs in San Francisco until 5 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a434ca2117f0bf2951be65414e84aab73f3a3757/0_0_4256_2832/master/4256.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa31d6a338503a0eb66cf823ec98dc4d 1010w","title":"can i buy a fast and powerful work laptop for under 700 pounds budget","story":"Ivana is on a budget but still wants a new 13in machine that can handle tougher tasks than email and browsingI left my corporate job a few months ago and now need to purchase a new laptop for my work. I am looking for a 13in laptop in the £500-£700 range. I am not too picky about the aesthetics. What matters most is that it’s fast and can handle more tasks than just email and browsing. What is my best bet? IvanaThis is an interesting question, partly because the mainstream PC market is broadly ided into two main groups. There are lots of low-end laptops aimed at consumers, and they usually cost around £250 to £500. (Yes, there are even cheaper systems.) Examples include the Lenovo Ideapad 110, Asus VivoBook, and lots of HP Pavilion and Dell Inspiron laptops. Most are relatively slow, but some are fast enough for your purposes.There are also lots of upmarket laptops for high-end buyers and freelancers, and they usually cost from £750 to £1,500. (Yes, there are even more expensive systems, especially the ones designed for gaming.) Examples include the Dell XPS 13, Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, HP’s Spectre 13 and EliteBook x360 G2, the Microsoft Surface range and many more. Most of them are thin and fast, but you are also paying a premium for aesthetics.The third option is to look at laptops aimed at IT managers, especially those in large corporations. Most are designed more for durability, reparability and predictability than for speed or style. The main examples are Lenovo (formerly IBM) ThinkPads, Dell Latitudes, and HP Elitebooks. You can also buy refurbished models of these machines from corporate asset management companies such as Tier1Online.It would be useful to know the specification of the laptop that you used in your corporate job, for comparison purposes, and the work involved. How fast was the processor? How much memory did it have? Did it have a traditional hard disk drive or a faster SSD? What was the screen resolution?Was your corporate laptop as fast as you wanted, or did it feel too slow?If you know which CPU you had, you can check its PassMark score, or find it on Notebookcheck’s list of mobile processor benchmarks. You will then be able to make sure you buy a faster CPU and as much or more memory than you had before.A typical corporate laptop today might have an Intel Core i5-5200U or similar processor, 8GB of memory, and a 128GB or 256GB SSD. I reckon you would find that a usable specification. However, it can be very frustrating to go from a fast laptop to a slow one, so try to avoid that.As for size, 13.3in screens are not as popular as they used to be, and there are now models with 10.1in, 11.6in, 12.5in and 14in screens as well. Ultraportables with 10.1in or 11.6in screens are a bit small for everyday use, but 14in models are becoming increasingly common.If you buy a consumer laptop you’ll have the advantage of shopping for one of the better models, but there’s not a lot to choose between them. There’s been a trend towards more solid construction and better trackpads, along with higher prices.You can check out the different models at stores such as PC World and John Lewis, but there are many other suppliers. I’m linking to PC World partly because I did that myself on Tuesday.The main drawback with the HP Pavilion 14 and similar consumer laptops is that most of them have a standard Windows screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. But if this is what you’re used to, you probably won’t mind.One of the advantages of buying a Dell business laptop – not an Inspiron – is that you can add next-business-day on-site service for a low price. For example, you could get a 14in Vostro 5471 from Dell’s small businesssoho range with a Core i5-8250U8GB256GB spec for £579 plus delivery and VAT. You could then add four years of collect-and-return service for £50.36, or four years of on-site service for £95.14. I’ve used this service in the past, and have it on my current Dell desktop. I can confirm that having someone turn up on your doorstep to fix things is fantastic value for 46p a week.The Vostro 5471 with the spec mentioned, four years of ProSupport Plus and on-site service, VAT and delivery currently comes to £885.05. It busts your budget, but if you are used to getting good IT support, it’s probably worth it.Bear in mind that you can also buy HP laptops direct and add three years of pick up-and-return service for £79 or less. If you like the HP Pavilion 14, you can get a 14-bk002na with 4GB and a Full HD (1920 x 1080-pixel) screen for £429, or a silver Pavilion x360 14-ba007na with 8GB and a 1366 x 768 screen for (flash sale) £449.10. Both these laptops have Core i3-7100U processors and 128GB SSDs.Most Pavilion 14 laptops have two memory slots, so you should be able to expand a 4GB system to 8GB, but check before buying. Their usual maximum memory is 16GB.Most refurb buyers are looking for cheap machines, typically under £250. In your case, you could get a high-end laptop – the latest X1 Carbon starts at £1,439.99 – within your budget.Refurbs are available from many other websites including Laptop Outlet and Dell Outlet, as well as on Amazon and eBay. As long as you go for a decent spec, they should do what you need.Have you got a question?

The EU’s office in Scotland was established close to Edinburgh Castle in 1975, the year of the UK’s first referendum on the then EEC, in order for Brussels to build contacts with local politicians. The office in London comprises eight floors and has an area of approximately 34,000 square feet. “Although the UK is set to become a third country, as a former member state with many links to the EU, it nonetheless – and whatever the outcome of the negotiations – will remain a special and essential partner of the union. Most notably, as of now, more than 3 million non-British EU citizens reside in the United Kingdom,” Welle said.“Both the London and Edinburgh offices offer unique advantages to particular parliament’s positions and serve as a vehicle for communicating with citizens.”Welle continues: “The House of Europe in London is moreover ideally suited to host a wide range of external events, thanks to its location and meeting facilities, which may also serve as a means of engaging with civil society in the international setting that London will undoubtedly remain.Welle’s note says, however, that the European parliament will have to examine its contracts with British suppliers when the UK withdraws from the EU.While the ongoing Brexit negotiations might provide further clarity, he writes: “The handling of contracts of parliament with British companies that will be in force when Brexit becomes effective is a further area of interest.“One might have to analyse also contracts concluded with subsidiaries of British companies located in EU member states, such as the internet and voice data supply contractor of parliament ... A process of continuous legal and operational analysis has been initiated by the secretary general in the legal service, on the basis of a screening exercise.”In January 2016, BT announced two new contracts with the European commission worth £24m to deliver public and private cloud services across 52 major European institutions, agencies and bodies – including the European parliament, the European council and the European Defence Agency. “We firmly believe that BT should continue to retain its existing EU contracts and be able to bid for new EU contracts post-Brexit,” the company said on Thursday.The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: “Brexit is bad for British companies doing business anywhere in the EU. At the moment British companies have the right to tender for EU contracts – that will be lost when we leave.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/432378c97aa4f8bb8ceaad942dd0cddf30ce0d82/0_168_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c155b64d1ade49e31330c2c26e0d0f9","title":"my whole life has been a lie sweden admits meatballs are turkish","story":"Turks don’t mince their words as they relish news that Ikea’s famous dish is not SwedishTurks have reacted with undisguised glee to what many have described as an official – and certainly long overdue – confession from Stockholm that Sweden’s signature national dish is, in fact, Turkish. “Those famous Swedish meatballs you get in Ikea are actually Turkish, admits Swedish government,” tweeted TRT World, Turkey’s publicly funded international television news channel. “Swedish meatballs originally Turkish dish: Swedish government,” said the headline in Hürriyet Daily News, after Sweden’s official national Twitter account, @swedense, came clean last weekend.“Swedish meatballs are actually based on a recipe King Charles XII brought home from Turkey in the early 18th century,” the Swedish account revealed abruptly and for no immediately apparent reason. “Let’s stick to the facts!”Turkey’s Anadolu agency seized the chance to speak to Annie Mattsson, of the literature department at Uppsala University, who confirmed that after losing a key battle against Russia in 1709, Charles and the remnants of his army took refuge in what is now Moldova, then part of the Ottoman empire. Once known as “the Lion of the North” and “Swedish Meteor” for his early military prowess, Charles, who acceded to the throne in 1697 at the age of 15, had bitten off rather more than he could chew by taking on Russia, and spent the following six years in exile in and around present-day Turkey.Having acquired a taste for the local cuisine, he returned to Sweden in 1714 with the recipe not just for köfte, the spiced lamb and beef meatballs that in time became the Swedish staple köttbullar, but also for the popular stuffed cabbage dish now known in Sweden as kåldolmar.In Turkey’s meatball capital, Inegöl, this week, a local chef, İbrahim Veysel, told the Doğan news agency it was an honour that the Turkish dish should have become “an example to different cuisines all over the world”.Others were less happy. Serdar Çam, president of the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency, complained that Ikea, which sells 2m meatballs a day in its in-store restaurants, should not be selling the dish as though it were Swedish.Örjan, the forlorn – though presumably tongue-in-cheek – Swede currently curating the country’s @sweden tourism account, rotated every week, lamented that the news had robbed life of its meaning. “My whole life has been a lie,” he tweeted."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3482048.1525296876!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck 10 year timeline","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHSE director general Tony O’Brien: there are 10 active legal claims in relation to the CervicalCheck audit controversy.  Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill2008: CervicalCheck – a national cervical screening programme is set up as “a quality-assured, organised and population-based screening programme” to provide free cervical screening to women aged 25 to 60. The CervicalCheck women’s charter says the service is “committed to providing a safe and reliable service to women”. The National Cancer Screening Service awards the contract to analyse 300,000 Irish smear tests a year to US firm Quest Diagnostics.2010: Clinical Pathology Laboratories, based in Austin, Texas, wins the contract to provide laboratory services for CervicalCheck. Two laboratories in Ireland also have similar contracts.2011: Limerick woman Vicky Phelan attends CervicalCheck for a routine smear test and wrongly receives the all-clear. 2014: An audit of smear tests reveals to health service professionals that Ms Phelan had wrongly received the all-clear, but she is not told about it. Having sought medical assistance on her own initiative, Ms Phelan is diagnosed with cervical cancer. She undergoes an aggressive form of radiation and chemotherapy and eventually gets the all-clear.2017: Ms Phelan had been cancer-free for almost three years until a routine scan in November reveals the cancer is back.September 2017: Ms Phelan learns that her cancer was missed through a chance reading of her medical file while waiting for an appointment. Wednesday, April 25th, 2018: Ms Phelan settles a High Court action against Clinical Pathology Laboratories for €2.5 million with no admission of liability. The money will allow her trial new drugs and may extend her life, she says. Friday, April 27th: Minister for Health Simon Harris says he does not have confidence in the management of the CervicalCheck programme. The HSE says it now knows a review was warranted in 442 cervical smear cases and more than 200 cervical smear results should have resulted in earlier intervention. It was revealed that Dr Gráinne Flannelly, the clinical director of CervicalCheck, told Limerick gynaecologist Dr Kevin Hickey in a July 2017 email that several women should not be told about false negative tests discovered in an audit and that the doctor should “simply file” the audited test results in the patients’ medical files.Saturday, April 28th: A helpline opens for concerned women. By 1.30pm it receives more than 600 calls. More than 2,000 people contact the Health Service Executive’s CervicalCheck programme over the weekend. Former master of the Rotunda Hospital Sam Coulter-Smith says he warned the government a decade ago against testing being moved to private companies overseas, because he was worried that resulting problems would mean cancer cases being missed.Monday, April 30th: David Gibbons, the former chair of the cytologyhistology group within the quality assurance committee of the National Cervical Screening Programme, says he had resigned over outsourcing the analysis of smear tests to the US. Dr Gibbons says he resigned after his warnings were ignored. He says figures from the US showed a one-third lower detection rate of high-grade dysplasias (pre-cancerous cells) compared to Irish labs, with a “mismatch” of systems because Ireland tests for cervical cancer every three years while the US tests smear samples annually. He said he made his concern known to HSE chief Tony O’Brien.Tuesday, May 1st: Simon Harris tells the Dáil an additional 1,500 women who have cervical cancer did not have their earlier negative smears rechecked. He also suggests the Government may set up a commission of investigation into the affair.Wednesday, May 2nd: HSE chief Tony O’Brien reveals there are 10 active legal claims in relation to the CervicalCheck audit controversy.

He is due to leave the HSE in July. It is understood there was contact between Minister for Health Simon Harris and Mr O’Brien this morning and an agreement for him to step down was reached.Mr O’Brien’s position in Evofem entitles him to annual fee of $65,000 and share-buying options up to $450,000 in his first three years with the company.There has been renewed calls for him to stand aside from his position due to the ongoing controversy over the CervicalCheck controversy.It has emerged following a High Court case taken by terminally ill Limerick woman Vicky Phelan (43) that scores of women with cervical cancer were not told that smear test results showing them to be in the clear were in fact inaccurate and the revised test results were kept from them for years.Ms Phelan who was diagnosed with incurable cervical cancer last year. The diagnosis followed a false negative result from a cervical smear which was tested in 2011.The Government is to establish a non-statutory inquiry to provide immediate answers to the CervicalCheck controversy before deciding if a commission of investigation is required.Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty said Mr O’Brien’s decision to stand aside from the board did not go far enough. He said the move “only goes to show the inappropriateness of the health minister’s sanctioning the board appointment”.Tánaiste Simon Coveney said Mr O’Brien “can be of most use to the women of Ireland if he focuses now on the most important” role of establishing the facts in the cervical smear controversy.He said Mr O’Brien would focus on making a positive contribution to the work that needed to be done in relation to the cervical cancer screening controversy.Mr Coveney said Irish women had been badly let down and that there was a real sense of anger and frustration within Government at what had happened and how.There had been “ a disgraceful breach of trust between thousands of women and the State”, he added. Mr Coveney twice did not respond to Mr Doherty when pressed as to whether or not he had confidence in Mr O’Brien. However, he pointed out that the clinical director of CervicalCheck had resigned and the director of the service had stood aside.“This is about accountability, providing full information, responsibly, comprehensively to a disgraceful breach of trust,” Mr Coveney added.Mr Doherty said that Mr O’Brien did not have to be in place for him to co-operate with the inquiry set up to investigate.He added that Ms Phelan had said that “heads absolutely need to roll, especially Tony O’Brien’s” and had criticised his refusal at the Oireachtas health committee meeting to accept full responsibility “for the cock-up”.“This is so serious. We don’t need an inquiry to know it happened on Tony O’Brien’s watch,” Mr Doherty said. “We cannot allow Tony O’Brien to walk off into the sunset with his pension in six weeks time without accountability”.Mr Coveney said that no one should doubt that there would be full accountability following an independent process led by international experts.Separtely, the woman who brought the CervicalCheck controversy to light has called for a public commission of investigation to look into how cancer patients have been treated by the health service.Vicky Phelan said an urgent and prompt investigation was required and that there has already been too much secrecy around the issue.“As the woman who exposed this scandal, I want to see a Commission of Investigation that is both urgent and prompt but also PUBLIC. Too much has already happened behind closed doors,” Ms Phelan tweeted on Thursday morning.She also said Mr O’Brien should step down over the scandal.“Heads absolutely need to roll, in particular Tony O’Brien’s,” she said.Speaking before an Oireachtas committee on Wednesday, Mr O’Brien said he would not stand down. While recognising his organisation had made mistakes, Mr O’Briensaid he didn’t personally “cock up” so he would not take responsibility for it.It was agreed a person from outside the State would be appointed to conduct a “scoping exercise” to answer the immediate questions including how many women are affected, how many should been informed of a delay in their diagnosis and the level of knowledge within the health service of the extent of the issue.The inidual will be asked to examine if a commission of inquiry is warranted and to decide the possible terms of reference for such an inquiry.A preliminary inquiry will report back in a number of weeks, he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “Let’s see what they say.”He also expressed concern that more cases may be uncovered. If there are other cases that have been settled and not disclosed by the HSE and the Department of Health that would mean they had not been “fully candid” with the Oireachtas Committee and “that would be very worrying indeed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481694.1525330729!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"karl marx s insights retain their clout and relevance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA statue of German philosopher, economist, political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx is placed on its plinth in his birthplace of Trier, Germany. Photograph: Harald TittelAFPGetty His view over Brussels’s magnificent Grand Place from La Maison du Cygne was a vivid architectural representation of what he was trying to write. History as class struggle.The tall gothic and baroque guild houses, an expression of the rise to pre-eminence of the merchant bourgeoisie, and the town hall spoke of municipal power and wealth. And surrounded by a city teeming with the poor and hungry . . .An impoverished Karl Marx, barely 30, spent three years here from 1846.And in the back room of what is now one of Brussels’ most chic restaurants, with friend Friedrich Engels, he laboured over their most important work, The Manifesto of the Communist Party, part-groundbreaking philosophical and historical thesis, but above all a call to action that would reverberate around the world.Two hundred years ago next Saturday, Marx was born in the small German town of Trier, where EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will deliver a speech for the birthday unveiling of a 5.5m statue of the local boy, a gift from the People’s Republic of China.“Nobody can deny that Karl Marx is a figure who shaped history in one way or the other,” a commission spokeswoman defensively insisted. “Not speaking about him would come close to denying history.”His intellectual legacy is everywhere. Last week with a laugh, a senior Irish diplomat described to me the “mao dun” – Chinese for “internal contradiction” – at the heart of a commission proposal. Doomed, he was suggesting, like capitalism and its contradictions, to the dustbin of history.Neither Juncker nor my diplomat, you may be relieved to hear, are closet Marxists, but in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 , they, like many others, economists, historians and philosophers, have been willing to look again seriously at the ideas of a man at whose door most of the 20th century’s woes have been unfairly laid by conventional opinion.And yet. No more than the bloody crusades, or the terreur and the guillotine can be said definitively to characterise Christendom or the French Republic,\u0026nbsp Marx too can and must be rescued from his disciples’ excesses and intellectual rigidities. “If anything is certain,” he would claim to “revolutionary phrase-mongering” adherents, “it is that I myself am not a Marxist.”Rescuing Marx is first and foremost about rescuing his thinking from the charge – a caricature – of dogmatism and rigidity. On the contrary, it is above all a methodology of thinking and analysis, not a fixed position, not a political programme, nor a set of explicit prescriptions for the world’s ills.One that explores the dynamics of constant change in the economic, political and ideological spheres as the working-out of contradictions. In Marx’s view, these are the tensions between old ways of creating the means of survival, and their social organisation, and new, emerging forms of economic and political organisation. Irreconcilable opposites in whose synthesis the new world is created.But for Marx, and his “historical materialism”, history itself was inherently open-ended: “All history is nothing but a continuous transformation of human nature.”“In Marx’s vision, which cannot recognise anything as absolutely final,” the late philosopher István Mészáros wrote, “there can be no place for a utopian golden age, neither ‘round the corner’ nor astronomical distances away. Such a golden age would be an end of history, and thus the end of man himself.”It was not Marxists who announced “the end of history” on the fall of the Soviet Union, supposedly the triumph of capitalism as the highest and unsurpassable civilisation. Such finality is absurd to them.Marx’s analysis and insights have made much of modern sociology and shaped political and historical theory. Gender theory, race theory, and new insights into humanity’s ecological death wish, have all added to and deepened his insights into the exploitation that drives capitalismEven right-wing economists nod at his critique of the market. The jury may still be out on whether, as he predicts, there is an inevitable tendency for the rate of profit to fall.But, most recently, in a powerful dissection of the data on wealth concentrations and distribution over the last 250 years, French economist Thomas Piketty convincingly linked growing global inequality to the fact that the rate of capital return in developed countries is persistently greater than the rate of economic growth. In other words, as Marx predicted, under capitalism the rich will get richer and the poor, poorer .“The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point is to change it,” Marx wrote in 1845. And the view of the cobbled square from the Maison du Cygne remains. Unchanged."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017.

François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481984.1525297392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords backs move to prevent hard border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble:   said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesBritain’s House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border after Brexit under which no new checks or controls could be imposed without the agreement of the Irish Government. Peers voted by 309 to 242 in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was proposed by former Conservative minister and EU commissioner Chris Patten. It says Brexit must not diminish any form of North-South co-operation or create or facilitate Border arrangements featuring any new infrastructure, checks or controls without an agreement between London and Dublin. Lord Patten said the amendment reflected prime minister Theresa May’s stated policy, which was under pressure from hardline Brexiteers, and he rejected the charge that raising fears about a hard border was playing with fire.“I will tell you what I think playing with fire is: blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy which is sometimes clueless and sometimes delinquent with a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. That is playing with fire. That is what we are in danger of doing,” he said.Former first minister David Trimble was one of a number of former unionist politicians to speak against the amendment, suggesting that Brussels and Dublin were seeking to change the way Northern Ireland was governed.“The drive is there to get Northern Ireland into a special situation: linked permanently to the European Union and with the union with the rest of the United Kingdom to that extent weakened,” he said.Lord Trimble said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London, which had improved dramatically since the Good Friday Agreement.“They have been extremely good and I am delighted, but the behaviour at the moment of the Irish prime minister and Coveney, backed up by the European Union, is actually destroying that relationship and doing considerable damage to it,” he said.Wednesday night’s vote, in which 19 Conservative peers supported the amendment, was the 10th defeat the Lords have inflicted on the government during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481967.1525291648!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish border centre stage at westminster and in eu negotiations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDavid Trimble was one of a number of speakers in the House of Lords who complained that Dublin and Brussels were engaging with only one community in Northern Ireland. Photograph: Peter MorrisonAP PhotoWednesday’s debate in the House of Lords about Brexit and the Border was an elegant affair, with Chris Patten and Northern Ireland minister Ian Duncan quoting lines from Louis MacNeice to one another and peers displaying elaborate courtesy as they argued. The debate underscored the central position the Border now occupies in the Brexit negotiations, and in Theresa May’s efforts to agree a common position with her ministers on future customs arrangements.The debate also exposed, however, the rawness which has entered into the atmosphere between London and Dublin and between unionist politicians and their counterparts in Dublin.Patten poked fun at Brexiteers who blamed Dublin for the impasse over the Border, and at David Davis’s theory about who was pulling Leo Varadkar’s strings.“The secretary of state for exiting the European Union said that the problem was because the leader of the Fine Gael party, the Taoiseach, was in the pocket of Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin and Fine Gael – I think the secretary of state must have been away the day they did Irish history at school,” he said.But former Alliance leader John Alderdice said the idea of a coalition between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin was not such a fanciful one and historian Paul Bew agreed, pointing to an email exchange between the Taoiseach’s office and Sinn Féin “showing an intimacy of spirit which nobody would have believed possible from a Fine Gael government”.David Trimble was one of a number of speakers who complained that Dublin and Brussels were engaging with only one community in Northern Ireland, suggesting that making deals over the heads of the people was a greater threat to peace than Brexit.“If future arrangements are to be made over the Northern Ireland Border it is obvious that you have to have the people of Northern Ireland and their elected representatives closely involved in that. If not, you are going to make the same mistake,” he said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481907.1525286901!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may postpones customs decision after ministers disagree","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg denied that Brexiteers had given Theresa May an ultimatum on customs arrangements with EU. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireTheresa May has postponed a decision on Britain’s future customs relationship with the European Union, asking officials to draw up revised proposals after her senior ministers failed to agree a common approach. The cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee met on Wednesday after Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers called on the prime minister to abandon one of her two customs proposals.Reports after the meeting suggested that Ms May’s new home secretary, Sajid Javid, and defence secretary Gavin Williamson joined Brexiteer ministers to oppose the proposed “customs partnership”, which would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. Ministers opposed to a hard Brexit, including chancellor Philip Hammond and business secretary Greg Clark, spoke in favour of it.The European Research Group (ERG) of 60 MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the customs partnership as unworkable and urged the government to focus exclusively on a second option of a customs arrangement known as Maximum Facilitation or MaxFac, which would use technological and administrative measures to make customs controls less intrusive.Mr Rees-Mogg denied that the group was threatening to move against the prime minister unless she took the customs partnership off the table.“There is no question of there being an ultimatum. This is a paper that has been produced on a specific aspect of policy that would not work, that would not effectively take us out of the European Union. It would leave us de facto in both the customs union and the single market,” he told the BBCHousing minister Dominic Raab, who campaigned for Brexit, said\u0026nbspthose opposed to the customs partnership option appeared to be winning the argument.“I always keep an open mind on this because I do think when it comes to Brexit we are going to be forging a distinct path, the UK, not taking some off-the-shelf model. But I suspect actually in terms of delivering the two things that we need, which is to stay out of the customs union but also avoid the hard border as a matter of principle but also workability, at the moment the way I read it is that those in favour of max fac are winning the argument,” he said.At prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Ms May said there were “a number of ways” to deliver frictionless trade and avoid a hard Border in Ireland, fuelling speculation that the government is looking at a third option in an effort to unite the cabinet. Asked about the prime minister’s remarks, her spokesman said the government’s ideas on the customs relationship were evolving.“Work has been ongoing on two options that work has been proceeding. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along the prime minister said there’s a number of options of ways to proceed,” he said.Labour’s Stephen Doughty, who supports a campaign for a second referendum on leaving the EU, said the government was negotiating with itself about customs options Brussels has already rejected, and the government’s negotiation with itself was going about as well as its negotiations with the EU.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“With less than six months to go before the final Brexit deal is supposed to be agreed, Ministers are still fighting among themselves about which of their two discredited customs proposals to persist with. Our European negotiating partners, who have for good reason already dismissed both proposals as unworkable, must be baffled as to what on earth the government wants,” he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

He has tried it and says it tastes a bit like rabbit.His proposal, launched on his Facebook page, has caused a lively social media debate, with some people in favour of the idea and others revolted by the prospect of tucking it what looks like a cross-between a beaver and a large rat.“The debate about coypu has become bonkers, without coming to any resolution of the problem,” the 31-year-old mayor wrote.“Here’s my idea – let’s start eating them in restaurants and at village food festivals.”However unpalatable the idea, he insisted that he was not joking and said there were regions of Italy that were already warming to the idea of tucking into roast, broiled or braised coypu.“I’m totally serious. It’s true that there is a sense of revulsion towards the coypu but you just have to go into a pig farm to put it into context – everybody loves to eat prosciutto. We should at least start to discuss the idea.”The mayor said he was speaking from practical experience, having eaten coypu meat. “It’s almost better than rabbit,” he said.One enthusiastic backer of the idea wrote on social media: “Coypus are very clean animals and they are herbivores. I’ve tried them a few times. They should be cooked in a stew with onions or baked in the oven. I agree with the mayor – it’s better than rabbit.”Animal lovers were less enamoured of the idea. “Here’s another genius who thinks he can resolve a problem by killing defenseless animals. And they elected him mayor,” wrote one critic.Coypu – which are also known as nutria – have adapted well to a range of different habitats in Italy.A coypu on steps leading down to the Tiber River in the centre of RomeThey can even be seen in the middle of Rome, nibbling on sedges on the banks of the Tiber.They breed prolifically, with a female capable of giving birth to up to a dozen young at a time.No one knows how many coypu there are living wild in Italy.In the region of Emilia-Romagna alone there are believed to be around one million, while Lombardy has a population of around 1.3 million, with the regional government calling for 300,000 to be culled each year.In their native range they are eaten by alligators, large snakes and eagles.A lack of such predators in Europe has contributed to their rapid population growth.They have also colonised part of the United States, with 18 states reporting significant coypu populations.There, too, there is a debate over eating them. In Louisiana, where they have thrived in swamps and wetlands, the state’s wildlife and fisheries department suggests a range of recipes, from coypu fettucini and soup to coypu a l’orange.A website with the tag line “Can’t Beat’em, Eat’em,” enthuses that the furry rodents are “among the healthiest of meats to consume”.Please review our commenting policyMissing hiker faces huge bill for rescue operation after he was found in luxury hotelComment: It\u0026#39s the young who most regret the lost art of reading a mapWorld\u0026#39s loneliest plant is looking for love at newly restored Temperate House in Kew GardensLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchBritish military police search German river for toddler who vanished 36 years Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Donald Trump says $130,000 payment to \u0026#39extortionist\u0026#39 Stormy Daniels was \u0026#39not campaign money\u0026#39Columbine massacre fanatics planned to re-enact shooting at their North Yorkshire school, court hears British Army shows off capabilities in joint force demoOn this day in 1469: Niccolò Machiavelli, author of The Prince, is bornComment: Yet again, David Davis’s words are coming back to haunt himHenry Vincent funeral: Tempers flare as man arrested and rocks are thrown after mourners swear out of windowsReleased after 43 years: Murderer who became one of Britain\u0026#39s longest serving prisoners is freedHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  Britain \u0026#39deeply concerned\u0026#39 by Palestinian president\u0026#39s Holocaust remarksIowa set to ban abortions after six weeks\u0026#39Social media has become weaponised\u0026#39: Lyse Doucet reflects on seven years of war in Syria Malaysian opposition leader investigated for \u0026#39fake news\u0026#39 after claiming plane was sabotagedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/12/snow-uk-5-1.jpg","title":"brexit uk services industry aprils results economyt gdp pmi","story":"Recent Purchasing Managers’ Index readings imply\u0026nbspa GDP growth rate of just 0.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2018The dominant services sector managed only a modest bounce back in April after the previous month’s weather disruption, spelling further bad news for the broader economy.The Purchasing Managers’ Index came in at 52.8 in the month, up from the 20-month low of 51.7 in March, but still well below the average for the past year and a half.Firms surveyed named “Brexit uncertainty” as one of the factors weighing on the sector.The real reasons behind collapse of UK economic growth to 6-year lowServices account for about 80 per cent of the UK’s GDP.The Office for National Statistics estimated last week that the overall economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2018, the weakest in more than five years.Chris Williamson of IHS Markit, which compiles the PMI surveys, said that recent survey readings implied a GDP growth rate of just 0.2 per cent in the second quarter too.“The services survey adds to signs that the rate of economic growth remained disappointingly subdued at the start of the second quarter,” he said.The pound fell against the dollar in the wake of the weak services survey reading, hitting $1.3576, as traders scaled back bets again that the Bank will be confident enough in the underlying momentum of the economy to raise interest rates this month.“Following today’s data, nobody can have strong conviction that the economy’s Q1 slowdown will be just a blip,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.The services PMI covers sectors ranging from hotels and restaurants, to computing and IT firms and financial services companies.

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions.

She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Trees, for example, tend to stop growing outwards when they make contact with their neighbours’ branches.However, the mechanisms by which plants signal using touch are poorly understood, and Dr Ninkovic and his colleagues wanted to find out whether the answers could be found underground.In recent years scientists have begun to disentangle the complex communication system that links plants together. Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Unlike animals, plants do not have nervous systems and so cannot communicate using rapid electrical signals.Instead, their signalling both within their bodies and with neighbours consists of the relatively slow exchange of chemical messages.Some of this communication takes place via strands of underground fungi that plants use to share food, warning signals and even toxic chemicals – a phenomenon that some biologists have informally termed the “wood-wide web”.In the study by Dr Ninkovic and his colleagues, they wanted to investigate whether chemicals released directly into the soil by stressed plants could change the behaviour of their neighbours.Five plants and animals utterly confused by climate changeThe researchers began by applying a soft brush to corn seedlings, a touch that could represent any number of nearby stresses, including new plants encroaching on their territory or a plant-eating animal nibbling on their leaves.New seedlings were then transferred into the same growing material as the recently touched plants to see if their growth was affected – the theory being that plants touched by the brush would have left chemical traces in the soil documenting their experience.The scientists found that the fresh seedlings responded by growing more leaves and fewer roots than plants that had grown under normal conditions.They suggested that the corn seedlings, upon being exposed to the chemical signals of recently touched plants in the soil, were responding by preparing themselves for the trouble ahead posed by new neighbours or becoming something’s dinner.While they seem largely defenceless against outside attack, plants actually wield a variety of defensive strategies when targeted by hungry herbivores. Previous research has demonstrated that plants respond defensively to the sounds that caterpillars make when munching on their leaves – flooding them with unappetising mustard oil.Engineers have figured out a way to make plants glowTo confirm that their plants were capable of telling the difference between soil occupied by touched and untouched plants, the scientists gave some corn seedlings a choice about which medium they preferred to grow in.When placed near both, roots grew preferentially towards the growing solution that had previously contained untouched plants.These findings were published in the scientific journal PLOS One.The team suggested their results should be noted by other scientists when conducting experiments with plants, as even gently brushing a plant’s leaves has the potential to change how it and its neighbours behave.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove also oppose itWith the overall balance of the cabinet six to five against the proposal, one source said Brexiteers now believe they have “killed” the option.Peers defeat government on plan for Irish border after BrexitUK police use EU system that may be lost post-Brexit 539m times a yearThe best Brexit deal does involve leaving the customs unionThis is why you should care about the local electionsAre countries really ‘queuing up for trade deals’ with Brexit UK?May ‘held hostage by extreme Brexiteers’ as customs decisions delayedBut in a sign that Ms May is not ready to let go of it, the prime minister asked for more work to be done on both of her existing proposals.The partnership plan would see Britain collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf at ports and airports, passing on a share of the money to Brussels – then if the UK sets different tariffs from the EU, traders would claim refunds from HMRC for goods that stay in Britain.Olly Robbins, Ms May’s Europe adviser, regards the partnership as a means of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, while keeping the UK out of the European customs union. Close aides of Ms May have also called it “intellectually perfect”.But Downing Street has been privately warned that the customs partnership proposal could collapse the government, with the Brexit-backing European Research Group having organised a critical report backed by 60 MPs.Boris Johnson: Northern Irish border being used to try and keep the UK in the customs unionThe group’s chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has called the proposal “cretinous”, “deeply unsatisfactory” and argued that it would “not get us out of the European Union, which is what people voted for”.The other option, a “streamlined arrangement”, is viewed more favourably by Brexiteers in both the cabinet and on the back benches.It is known as “maximum facilitation”, or even “max fac”, and would see the UK outside any customs union, but with some controls at the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.Backers say a “trusted trader” scheme and remote monitoring of the border would limit physical infrastructure.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

That work has been proceeding. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along.”The European commission has been pushing back against all of UK proposals, with reports that Brussels regards both as unworkable.EU officials have said they want a solution for the Irish border, and in turn customs arrangements, by its forthcoming summit in June.Failure to come up with an agreed plan could leave the UK forced to fall back on the European commission’s “backstop” option, which would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and see a customs border drawn down the Irish Sea.Ms May has insisted that no British prime minister could accept such a scenario, and the DUP which props up her government’s Commons majority have said they will not countenance it.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPresident Vladimir Putin meets with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in Sochi, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Supporters of opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan protest in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown.Around 42 per cent of the seats being contested this year are in London, where all 32 boroughs have elections.Pollsters say London is now a Labour city with large numbers of young people and ethnic minorities.One borough Labour will be hoping to nick from the Tories is Kensington and Chelsea, where council leaders faced fury over the Grenfell Tower disaster.However the Tories have a 24-seat majority so a huge swing would be required for the authority to change hands.Labour are also targeting Barnet - which has been Tory since the 1960s - as well as Conservative strongholds Westminster and Wandsworth, and will hope to extend majorities in other boroughs they already hold.The Lib Dems are hopeful of keeping hold of Sutton, their last London council, and hope to seize Kingston from the Tories.Outside London, Labour is defending 75 councils and aims to gain control of more in towns and cities across England.That will be a key test of national opinion after Jeremy Corbyns surprisingly strong result in the 2017 general election.Ones to watch out for include Amber Valley, Trafford, Swindon and Tamworth which are all narrowly held by the Conservatives.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.The demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that back Brexit.The Tories are seven short of a majority in unpredictable Thurrock, where 17 Ukip councillors all quit the party and are standing as independents.Theresa Mays party are also targeting Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth, where they lost control after a by-election last year.In London, Labour is on course for the best results by any party for 40 years, according to the latest YouGov survey for Queen Mary University of London.In Westminster the YouGov survey for The Times on May 2 shows 42 per cent of residents intend to vote for the Conservatives, 4 per cent more than those preparing to vote Labour.Jeremy Corbyns party has slipped three points since February but still leads the Conservatives by 51 per cent to 29 per cent.However Labour already dominate in London councils after large gains in 2014 and it is uncertain if the 22-point lead will be enough for them to snatch their target councils.They are forecast to remain runners-up in Westminster and Wandsworth.And though the stats predict a win in Tory stronghold Barnet, a large Jewish population could yet reject the party over the anti-Semitism scandal.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.He said the Tories could pick up councils in key Leave-voting areas such as Peterborough, Rugby, Basildon and Pendle.He said: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even if they have lost more seats in London.”In 2014 Labour, then led by Ed Miliband, gained 200 councillors and six councils, meaning they have more to lose and gains will be more difficult.Party elections boss Andrew Gwynne has admitted they wont get the massive boost that had been predicted until recently.This year some areas will see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Scotland Yard is investigating 65 allegations of voting corruption in London, The Sun revealed. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jh-graphic-p10-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"we dont need a customs union","story":"Behind closed doors in government and Parliament, two fierce battles are raging, and both are about Britain’s future trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.The first is about the decision ministers must make on the future customs relationship we establish with Europe after Brexit. The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The disdain they had for me, and the ownership of me because I’m black and a woman and a Muslim.She is one of many young people who are defying the Corbynista trend - saying the leftie Labour boss has made them LESS likely to support the party, even as he attracts thousands of youth voters with his radical message.Even diehard Labour supporters say theyve been pushed away, disgusted by the partys extreme foreign policy, runaway spending plans and anti-Semitism crisis.Sam Stopp, 27, has been a Labour councillor for four years - but is now thoroughly disillusioned by Mr Corbyns leadership.He told The Sun: It’s got to a point now that’s completely toxic, and there’s no way back for the forces of sanity in the party.The thing that really sped up the decision was anti-Semitism - it’s so detestable what’s going on at every level of the party.When you’re going to bed every night worrying about the party you’re in, it’s not a great situation.Not only is he not standing for re-election in Brent, West London at tomorrows council election - he has resigned from the party altogether.While some ex-Labour types initially gave Mr Corbyn the benefit of the doubt - Nimco said she kind of liked him when he took over - others were turned off from the moment he became leader.Edinburgh-based student Robbie Travers, 21, said: I resigned on the day Corbyn became leader.I’ve always been a supporter of the Blairite wing of the Labour party - that wing no longer exists.He told The Sun he was disturbed by Mr Corbyns foreign policy stance, including supporting the Kremlins line on the Salisbury poisoning and Syria chemical attack.Robbie also said he was outraged by the growth of anti-Semitism - admitting that the downside of no longer being a Labour member is that he cant fight for the rights of Jewish activists from the inside.Ms Ali, who moved to Cardiff as a child after fleeing Somalia with her family, said she fears Labour has a passive-aggressive attitude towards entrepreneurial ethnic minorities.She told The Sun: It’s the passive-aggressive racism of ‘stay poor, stay black’ - someone like me really baffles them. Being on the centre ground really freaks them out.How are you going to deliver better services when you’re driving out people who create wealth? They still think that the biggest issue is about keeping the jobs down the mines!None of those who spoke to us can bring themselves to vote Labour next time around - saying theyll back whichever party can keep Mr Corbyn out of power.Nimco - who joined Labour when Gordon Brown was leader - said: I’m happy to back the Tory party to keep Corbyn and his Shadow Cabinet out of power.The Labour party doesn’t represent the people that it says it speaks for. I want them to change - but there’s no hope for them.Robbie added: I would actively vote Conservative at elections to undermine Corbyn’s Labour party.I think Jeremy Corbyn is very much a red line in terms of ever supporting the Labour party again.And Sam - despite being a Labour official until recently - concluded: I would have to vote against Labour because it comes down to a choice between party and country. I really think the Labour party is an enemy of the state at the moment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403025806.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"statue man giant penis antwerp middelheim museum","story":"Locals are said to have given officials a hard time after the artwork was erected in the park of the Middelheim Museum in the Belgian city of Antwerp.The statue, called Arc de Triomphe, depicts a naked man bent backwards in a sort of crab position with his manhood brazenly pointing skyward.It is hoped the statue, which is made from plasticine, will be turned into a fountain, but it’s not clear just where the water will come out of.Museum director Sara Weyns said: I determine that nude bodies can indeed touch visitors.We do have quite a lot of nude bodies in our collection, but those are often womens bodies.Apparently those evoke less outrage than this piece.Of course this is a work made from plasticine and not from bronze, which makes it a lot more real-looking. I assume that is why the reactions are quite stronger.Many locals are thought to have complained and made some pretty stiff objections to the eye-catching sculpture, made by the Austrian art collective Getlitin.The piece is part of an exhibition called Antwerp Baroque 2018: Rubens Inspires which opens at the start of June.The exhibition refers to one of Antwerps most famous sons, the baroque master painter Peter Paul Rubens who is known for his nudes of voluptuous women.The museum invited 16 artists to submit art which was inspired by baroque landscaping elements."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/nintchdbpict000371625654.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"george osborne brexit podcast clegg","story":"The ex-Chancellor said “I don’t think you can stop Brexit” as he spoke to former Coalition partner and ex-deputy PM Nick Clegg.He said: “I don’t think you can have a second Referendum.

stripped of its innards and licence plates - was part of a movie shoot, but later confirmed no filming permits had been issued.Firefighters were called to cut down the vehicle and it was removed shortly before 11am (4pm GMT) as police launched a public mischief investigation.Officers said in a statement: This incident resulted in the use of significant resources that were not available to attend to genuine emergency calls for service.The car had no windows, seats, steering wheel or engine and was reportedly suspended from the bridge using a winch system - similar to devices used by tow trucks, according to the fire service.Cops said there was no threat to public safety and there was already caution tape around the area below the car before officers arrived.Constable Jenifferjit Sidhu told The Globe and Mail: There’s also the chance that whatever it was being held with could’ve broken or ripped apart and someone could have been hurt.“The main thing with this is the amount of resources it occupied, which could have been used to answer other emergency calls.”Social media users speculated whether engineering students were behind the alleged prank.But a representative of the engineering faculty at the University of Toronto, told the newspaper they were not involved, saying it was “far more serious” than any of their typical handiwork.It follows a similar prank in 2001 when University of British Columbia scholars suspended a classic Volkswagen Beetle from San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge.In 2009, students at the same university tried to pull off the stunt in Vancouver but the the cables broke and the vehicle was sent plunging into the water.Five undergraduates were caught and threatened with criminal charges.In 1994, Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering students placed a police car on the roof of a campus building and it had to be disassembled to be removed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000329463722.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"local elections 2018 results winners announced polls close","story":"If you are planning to stay up all night and watch the results as they come in, weve got everything you need to know right here..Local election polls opened this morning at 7am to allow some keen voters to get their vote done and dusted before heading off to work.For those of you who havent had a chance to vote yet, polling stations are open until 10pm this evening.If youre heading to cast a ballot at Woking, Gosport, Bromley, Watford or Swindon dont forget to take your voter ID as these council are taking part in a trial to stop voter fraud.The majority of councils will start counting over night so once the polls shut the first election results should be coming out within a matter of hours.However, some councils may wait to start counting on Friday daytime, leaving voters in suspense all night and most of the day.This years local elections are set to be a watched carefully for an indication on how Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyns parties are faring in the public opinion.Last year, Labour saw many red councils lost to their Conservative rivals - something they will be looking to gain back today.In London one of the key councils to watch is Barnet, North London - a former Tory stronghold which currently has 1 seat difference between the two major parties.Its been identified as a potential Labour swing seat, but with a large Jewish population it may see the antisemitism row within Labour cost Jeremy a relatively easy target.Other key targets in for Labour are Wandsworth, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Trafford and Swindon according to latest predictions.For the Conservatives, key councils include booting the Lib Dems out of Sutton, their council left in the country, Thurrock in Essex, Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth.1amThe fastest council to declare at 1am is expected to be Sunderland, a Labour stronghold, which has announced its results first for six years.Its thought Conservative safe seat Broxbourne wont be far behind and declare at around 1am.The first Labour-Tory battleground to declare it expected to be Swindon where Labour need just four seats to knock the Conservative majority and take control of the council.Experts predict Nuneaton \u0026amp Bedworth, Sefton, Cannock Chase, Bury, Basildon, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, Castle Point, Halton, Harlow, South Tyneside, Tameside, West Oxfordshire, and Exeter will also declare around 1am.1.30amPrestwich in Bury is expected to declare at around 1.30am and will be the first wards to show if there has been a swing away from Labour by its large Jewish population after the antisemitism scandal that has rocked Labour. 2amWestminster is expected to declare between 2 and 2.30am as Conservative despite the seat being ferociously targeted by Labour -if they managed to catch the council itll be the first time a red majority will have held Westminster since its formation.Also forecast to announce are Trafford, Peterborough, Amber Valley, Oxford, St Albans, Chorley, Epping Forest, Fareham, Hard, Hartlepool, Kingston-upon-Hull, North Herfordshire, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale, Rochford, Salford, Tamworth, Wirral, Wolverhampton, Worcester, Carlisle, Lincoln, Stevenage, Stockport, West Lancashire, and Wigan.3amWe can expect to see the first of the capitals mayoral result from Tower Hamlets - it isnt expected to be a guaranteed Labour win as a candidate for the Peoples Alliance of Tower Hamlets has mounted a fierce opposition against current Labour mayor John Biggs.Whoever wins the race for Tower Hamlets mayor will select their cabinet from the councillors elected in tonights vote which isnt expected to be declared for another five hours.Labour target Wandsworth is also expected to declare at 3am with their supporters anxiously looking on to see if they have taken it from the Conservatives.The other councils expected to declare are Sheffield, Dudley, Plymouth, Southend-on-Sea, Liverpool, Barking \u0026amp Dagenham, Hammersmith \u0026amp Fulham, North East Lincolnshire, Basingstoke \u0026amp Dean, Brentwood, Colchester, Eastleigh, Gosport, Havant, Rushmoor, Sandwell, St Helens, Tandridge, Waltham Forest, Cheltenham, Coventry, and Rugby.4amWe will see results from marginal council Barnet, hotly contested between both Labour and Conservatives as the last election saw the council stay blue by two seats.Its been targeted strongly by Labour but it is home to the largest Jewish population in the country who may help it remain a Conservative stronghold and out of Corbyns grasp.Lib Dem targeted Richmond-upon-Thames will also be declaring. It was a strong Conservative hold last time, but with the large number of EU remain voters living there it may become the Lib Dems second council in the country - assuming they hold onto Sutton which will be declaring almost an hour later.Also forecast to declare are Hillingdon, Reading, Walsall, Bradford, Portsmouth, Bolton, Ipswich, Slough, Wakefield, Wokingham, Daventry, Welwyn Hatfield.5amKensington and Chelsea, the most unpredictable result in the election, is expected to be declared at 5am  - in the wake of Labours recent general election there it is thought the council may turn red.However, staunch Tory supporters in the south of the borough may help them keep the council blue despite anger over the handling of the Grenfell disaster.UKIPs electoral clout will be put to the test in Thurrock which saw the party gain 17 councillors last time round - only for them all to quit en masse to form a new group denouncing party politics.Its expected to remain under Conservative control, but has had no majority party since Labour in 2012.Sutton will also be announcing their results and eyes will be watching to see if the Lib Dems retain their only council.Also expected to declare are Bexley, Southampton, Leeds, Winchester, Brent, and Cambridge.6amElection results start to quieten down with only Ealing and Derby expected to declare.Political reps will be gearing up for the final hours of TV battles and debates on breakfast television.7amCroydon, Redbridge, Camden, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets council are expected to declare.8amPolitical machines get whirring as voters sit down for breakfast to see Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis and Labour elections chief Andrew Gwynne battle it out on the silver screen.Its thought Merton and Greenwhich will declare around 8am.Theres expected to be around 50 of the 150 councils left to declare.12pmA big break is expected between 8am and 12pm before the next lot of declarations come in.First up in the afternoon is expected to be the Lewisham and Watford mayor results and Bromley council.1pmMore counts will be in from Calderdale, Solihull, Great Yarmouth, Burnley, Gateshead, Kirklees, and Milton Keynes.Also expected to be declared is the Newham mayor.2pmThe first of the metro mayors is expected to be declared in Sheffield.The councils declaring are thought to be Maidstone, Crawley, Hyndburn, Norwhich, Knowsley, North Tyneside, Rossendale, Runnymead, Hounslow, and Wyre Forest.3pmExpected to declare are Three Rivers, Hastings, Hackney mayor, Tunbridge Wells, Pendle, Adur, Barnsley, Craven, Harrogate, Huntingdonshrie, Mole Valley, Worthing, and Cherwell.4pmStragglers are still coming through with their counts late into the afternoon - in fact theres another estimate two hours before all the councils declare.Expected to announce results are Newcastle-under-Lyme, Harrow, Harringey, Watford, Blackburn with Darwen, Elmbridge, Reigate \u0026amp Barnstead.5pmDeclaring with an hour to go until all results are expected to be in are Kingston-upon-Thames, Newham, Lewisham, South Cambridge, and Woking.6pmAnd the FINAL results are in with South Lakeland, Birmingham, Manchester, Islington, Lambeth, and Hackeny being the last councils expected to declare.With that its all over, the political battle to gain new territory and snatch back old councils will have come to an end.We might even have an idea of what to expect when the next general election comes round in 2022. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The family tried to ignore them because we didn’t need to prove anything.Then I said, ‘let’s do the test then, to prove it and put a stop to them (rumours).”But when he received the results he was stunned to discover he wasn’t related to the couple who had raised him.The shocked family then started a desperate search for the truth - and their long-lost son.They asked the hospital Monsenhor Genesio for the names of all the babies born between October 1 and 7 1980.Only two on the list were boys, and when they found a photo of one of them - Noel -  they were sure he was the one who was their biological son.However, when they spoke to a neighbour where Noel used to live they were told the tragic news he had died aged just one.The couple gave up the search, but Noel’s sister, Nelma Rezende, started her own hunt for her real brother on learning of the Gaspars story from the neighbour .Nelma’s husband Caio eventually tracked Romualdo down after finding his godparents through the local registry office.He said when he finally saw a photo of Romualdo he felt sick as the similarity to his wife was incredible.At that moment I had no doubt that he was my wife’s brother,” he added.After Nelma made contact with her biological brother, a DNA test confirmed he was the son of Nelma’s parents, Osvaldo and Valdevina de Lima.This week Romualdo finally met his biological parents, who live just a few miles away in the same town.He also discovered he has eight more brothers and sisters and 18 nieces and nephews.His real mum Valdevina, who lost the boy she believed was her real son in 1981, told Brazil’s G1 website: “After 38 years, at first I thought this was all a joke.“But over time the penny dropped, that it was all true.”Romulado added : “For me, this has no price. No money could buy the happiness that I feel at the moment.”The couple who brought him up believing he was their son are still holding on to the hope their real son is still alive - and are determined to find him.Radigena Gaspar said: “I am not convinced that it was really my son who died.My heart tells me that my son is still alive. I want so much to encounter him.”The Monsenhor Genesio in Juruaia at the centre of the mix-up said they have no comment to make on the case.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is a British national and he couldnt vote.It is having an impact on certain people being disenfranchised by this trial.Brits will cast their ballots in 156 areas across the country today, to vote in councillors, local mayors and one MP in Northern Ireland.The local elections will be the latest sign of whether Mrs May or Jeremy Corbyn is in the political driving seat, one year on from the General Election where the PM lost her majority.Today the presiding officer at a polling station in Bromley said only a very small percentage of voters had forgotten or were unable to provide ID.The man, who did not wish to be named, said residents had received five pieces of information explaining the change in the rules, including leaflets and a note with their polling cards.Normally people only had to walk into a polling station and give their name and address to vote, which the Government said was open to voter fraud.The Prime Ministers spokesperson said this afternoon that the overwhelming majority of people are casting their vote without a problem.In the trial areas residents now have to bring with them photo ID, which ministers say will improve the security and the resilience of the electoral system that underpins our democracy.Voters have been told to bring their polling card, or photo ID such as a driving licence or passport. Watford will accept a valid credit or debt card, and Working will accept a bus pass.Gosport and Bromley require a poll card or TWO forms of ID, including one with your address on it.The new plans have been criticised by opposition parties, campaigners and charities, with Electoral Reform Society calling it deeply flawed.And Labour’s shadow minister Cat Smith said today’s issues were “proof that voter ID has no place in our democracy”.Hazel Walters, a resident of Bromley since 1983, said: Its absurd. I think it will discriminate against people.“Not everyones got a passport, a driving licence and all of that. I think people will be disenfranchised.”In response an Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: Returning Officers administering the elections in the pilot areas have run awareness campaigns to inform voters of what form of identification they need to bring in order to be able to vote.We encourage anyone who has queries about the pilots to contact their local councils electoral services department.“Polling stations are open until 10pm.Both parties have suffered bad publicity in recent weeks, as the Government has been criticised over the Windrush scandal and Labour struggles to tackle anti-Semitism.So the two leaders will both be keen to put in a strong performance at the polls this week, with 4,370 seats up for grabs.The polls opened at 7am and will close at 10pm, although if there’s a queue at the polling station you can still vote after 10 as long as you arrived before the deadline.This year some areas will also see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Heres how to find out who is running in your area.It’s likely to be a good night for Labour, since they tend to do better in urban areas than the Tories.Labour are targeting boroughs in the capital including Barnet - which has been a Tory council since the 1960s - as well as strongholds in Wandsworth and Westminster.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.And the demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that back Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403200662.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tesco waitrose merger supermarket lorry cab trailer hgv","story":"But could two more supermarkets be about to follow suit?Well, that’s what some have joked after a Tesco lorry was spotted pulling a Waitrose trailer yesterday.The unlikely alliance took place in Godalming, Surrey.It’s understood the Tesco driver came to the aid of the Waitrose lorry after it broke down - leaving its trailer blocking a road.Photos of the scene sparked much mirth after they were shared on Facebook.One user wrote: “Are Tesco and Waitrose merging? Now all you need now is pound stretchers and Marks and Spencers to merge and it will be called stretch marks”.Another commented: “Every little helps”.While another said: “Good on the old boy for helping out.”A Tesco spokesperson said: Every day we see examples of our colleagues going above and beyond, helping customers and supporting local communities.Its why we say: Every little helps.A Waitrose spokesperson added: Were grateful to the driver ... Every Little Helps.It comes as the deal between Sainsbury’s and Asda triggered fears it will lead to pricier groceries, store closures and job losses.The proposed deal would see them leapfrog Tesco to become the UKs biggest chain.Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey warned it risks squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further.She said in the absence of proper vetting by regulators, it would be British shoppers that suffer from rising prices and British workers that may be fearing for their jobs.The two chains are the second and third largest grocery retailers in the UK. Together they would have 31.4 per cent of the market compared to Tescos 27.6 per cent share.It comes as the boss of Sainsburys was caught singing Were in the Money on TV on Monday.Mike Coupes outburst came as he waited to be interviewed about the megadeal  and his supermarkets shares ended the day up 17 per cent.The chief exec did not realise his rendition of The Gold Diggers Song was being recorded by ITV.He sang: Were in the money, The skies are sunny, Lets lend it, spend it, send it rollin around! It is likely to anger critics who claim the merger will see job losses, store closures and higher prices.Mr Coupe said he was trying to compose himself ahead of his interview about the merger.He later apologised for his unfortunate choice of song, which he says was on his mind after he saw it performed in the musical 42nd Street last year.Sainsburys said their boss was simply trying to clear his mind, adding: To attach any wider meaning to this innocent, personal moment is preposterous."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403259972.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dogs polling stations cast vote local elections 2018","story":"London Mayor Sadiq Khan led the march of voters taking snaps of their dogs as they exercised their right to put a cross in the box this morning.He tweeted: Lunas first trip to a polling station! and a picture of himself and his gorgeous golden lab.Hes voting in Wandsworth, South London, where Labour are hoping to tip the balance of power and take over the borough for the first time in decades.And many other pet-owners have gone online to share their sweet snaps of their own dogs - after the trend popped up for 2015s General Election.Dogs are technically allowed in as long as they are just accompanying the voter and not running around causing havoc.But others have chosen to leave their beloved pets outside for a few minutes while they put their cross in the box.Olivias owner Dave said she would be voting for the LiBokral DemoNoCrats and the Greens (due to their pro-squirrel policies) in Lewisham.#DogsInPollingStations was trending on Twitter throughout the morning as snaps poured in from excited voters taking their pets with them to witness democracy in action.Britain is hitting the ballots today to cast their vote in the local elections which are being watched closely to see how Labour and the Conservative Party fare.Local election polls opened this morning at 7am to allow some keen voters to get their vote done and dusted before heading off to work.For those of you who havent had a chance to vote yet, polling stations are open until 10pm this evening.If youre heading to cast a ballot at Woking, Gosport, Bromley, Watford or Swindon dont forget to take your voter ID as these council are taking part in a trial to stop voter fraud.The majority of councils will start counting over night so once the polls shut the first election results should be coming out within a matter of hours.However, some councils may wait to start counting on Friday daytime, leaving voters in suspense all night and most of the day.Labour are expected to do well in city regions, but the Tories are set to rake in the votes in pro-Brexit Tory suburbs.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have already been out casting their votes today - alongside Lib Dem boss Vince Cable and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They were journalists, murdered on the job as they tried to report on the details of an earlier bombing.On the same day, BBC reporter was shot dead in the countrys eastern Khost province, marking the day out as the the deadliest day for journalists since the Charlie Hebdo massacre in 2015.It makes it all the more poignant that today is World Press Freedom Day, a date to celebrate the principles of press freedom and defend reporters around the world from attacks like these.Without a free press, its impossible to hold the powerful to account, expose injustices and fight for justice on the issues affecting ordinary people.And the world would become a far more confusing place without the reporters who dedicate their lives to unearthing the truth and sharing it with us all.Compared to countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, where journalists are routinely killed or jailed, it may seem like we have little use for Press Freedom day in the UK.But the sad truth is that there are major issues with press freedom close to home as well.Last month, Reporters Without Borders released its Press Freedom Index - a record of how free the media in each country is, based on the threat of government clampdowns and intimidation by journalists.Staggeringly, the UK came 40th out of 180 countries - worse than every other Western European nation apart from Italy.Best five countriesNotable othersWhen the index began in 2002, the UK ranked 22nd - but since then our position in the freedom league table has plummeted.This is partly due to the threats of Parliaments Data Protection Bill, which would force tougher rules on the press and give the state more power to regulate and ultimately muzzle the media.Another problem for press freedom in the UK is the general “climate of hostility towards the media”, which has seen British journalists threatened and intimidated online just for doing their job.Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, has received so much online abuse that she was assigned her own bodyguard last year.In other countries, like Afghanistan, press freedom is under threat from bombs and bullets as well as from the government and social media.On Monday, a bomb went off during rush hour in Kabul, and journalists in the city rushed to the scene so they could cover the story.But an ISIS fighter arrived at the site of the blast with them, disguised as a reporter.He joined the crowd of journalists on the scene and detonated - hammering home the warning that an official press vest can mark reporters out as targets, rather than affording them any protection.These deaths bring the total number of journalists killed so far this year to 24.In 2017, the total stood at 82, with 13 journalists killed in Mexico, 12 in Afghanistan and 11 in Iraq - the three most dangerous places to be a journalist.The years total was the lowest tally since 2007, according to the International Federation of Journalists, but it is still 82 too many.Elsewhere in the world, journalists still face the threat of being locked up for the crime of exposing the truth.Last year, 262 journalists were arrested - the highest number in almost three decades.Turkey is the worst offender, with 73 journalists currently behind bars, while 41 journalists have been imprisoned in China and 20 in Egypt.Its a sign that, on World Press Freedom Day, we have a long way to go and hard battles to fight before journalists around the world can be free to do their jobs without fear.But today is also a day to be thankful for the brave reporters who rush selflessly into danger armed with only their cameras and notebooks.And it is a day to remember all the journalists who have already given their lives in pursuit of a story. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
