The finished work features a black background splashed with red, pink, orange and whiteHowever crude, it’s joyful and there’s a strong, athletic abstract resemblance to a match – with the ball being shot from the background to the foreground.It almost looks to me like he’s used the ball as a paint brush. It’s very vibrant, very energetic, very different. He was probably covered in paint by the end. Is it a piece of performance art? I tried to see if I could see the scuff of the ball and the heel of his shoe in the paint.It could even be seen as a self-portrait in an abstract way because it represents him, the tennis player.I could almost see him with racquet in one hand and his tennis ball covered in paint in the other, whacking a ball against the canvas. But we’ve got to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek. I wouldn’t imagine that he’s saying, ‘I’m an artist’. But perhaps his wife Kim Sears, who is a fantastic dog portraitist, has had a great influence on him.If Pollock had picked up a tennis racquet we wouldn’t have said he’s going to win Wimbledon tomorrow. Maybe Andy was getting some aggression out, maybe he wanted to burn off some energy. I think he was just having a bit of fun. Let’s just hope he had plenty of plastic around him. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/10/4BABB1DC00000578-0-image-a-12_1524992569721.jpg","title":"BBC announces licence fee dispensation royal wedding","story":"The BBC has waived the licence fee for local communities who want to collectively watch Prince Harry marry Meghan MarklePipa Doubtfire, the BBC\u0027s head of revenue management, said: \u0027I\u0027m delighted to announce that we have decided to offer a one-off dispensation for the royal wedding on May 19.\u0027This will allow the public to enjoy live coverage of the occasion at special events like street parties, where TV is not usually watched, without needing to buy a licence.\u0027What seven-year-itch?

We are present in this country at the request of the government of Syria,\u0027 said Hossein Naghavi Hosseini, spokesman for parliamentary national security and foreign policy commission. The Syrian government has focused its efforts in 2018 on securing the capital Damascus, the heart of which was spared the worst of the seven-year-old conflict but was long surrounded by rebel-held pockets.Backed by massive Russian military support, the regime took full control of the Eastern Ghouta enclave earlier this month.The sprawling semi-rural area east of Damascus had been home to thousands of armed Islamist and jihadist fighters, who were besieged for years but sporadically fired rockets and mortar rounds on the capital.Pro-regime forces are now battling jihadists from the Islamic State group and other armed groups in southern neighbourhoods of Damascus.After days of air strikes and heavy fighting, state media reported late Sunday that those areas would be evacuated under deals similar to those that emptied other enclaves around Damascus in recent weeks.Buses started arriving Monday near Yarmuk, a neighbourhood once home to a Palestinian refugee camp and the main hub of IS forces in southern Damascus, state media reported.The transfer deal does not include IS fighters, but other jihadists from a former Al-Qaeda affiliate who control pockets inside Yarmuk, Abdel Rahman said. Netanyahu Says Israel Has Proof Iran Cheated on Nuclear Deal - The AtlanticNuclear Iran: The Birth of an Atomic State: David Patrikarakos: 9781780761251: Amazon.com: Books"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/12/4B8A680F00000578-0-image-m-17_1524657479817.jpg","title":"Woolwich homeowner 29 says jealous friends rent","story":"Why homeowner, 29, who managed to buy her own flat is still jealous of her pals who rent"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/17/4BB587A800000578-5674835-image-a-49_1525104074634.jpg","title":"Man asks internet sick day shown no mercy living room","story":"    The mirror took the most online abuse when the Reddit user asked for adviceA man who was pulling a sickie from work was savaged by angry Reddit users after asking how to spend his day off.The man posted an image of him from what appears to be his sofa, under a blanket and infront of the TV.He captioned it: \u0027Sick day today.

The kids can’t play outside in nice weather, because that’s when it’s worst. We can’t have people over for barbecues because it’s embarrassing. Who wants to sit outside in those conditions?’A very good question and one that he has been putting to Linden Homes, the estate’s developer, for the past 18 months.Mr Buller claims that when he bought the property he was never informed about what lurked beneath his lawn nor shown any drainage or sewage plans.The property was still a ‘building site’ when he first viewed it, and he says he felt under pressure to rush the purchase.‘We made an offer of £700,000 and it was accepted, but we were told we had to complete within two-and-a-half weeks if we wanted the deal at that price. The day I moved in, they were only just laying the grass as I pulled up.’It was not until a month later that Mr Buller spotted manhole covers on his front lawn.Linden Homes disputes his version of events and the two sides are now at loggerheads. Mr Buller has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estate and threatening legal action against Linden Homes.While his behaviour may seem extreme, Linden is not the only builder to come in for criticism. Pressure to fulfil government targets for building new homes has resulted in floods of complaints from customers. Problems include bouncing floors, leaks, missing insulation, poor drainage and unfinished gardens — as well as some cases of appalling customer service.Homeowner is mocked after putting his property on Rightmove¿...Divorcing naked gardeners are forced to drop price of their...Share this articleThis time last year one company, Bovis, was singled out for particular criticism. After it was forced to apologise, it set aside £10 million to pay for repairs and promised to cut back from building 6,000 homes a year to 3,500.The Home Builders Federation (HBF), the industry’s representative body, admitted that pressure to build new homes quickly had resulted in short-term problems. But it claims a corner has been turned and customer satisfaction is on the rise.Others are far from convinced. Across social media, groups charting the complaints of buyers against major construction firms run to thousands of members.They continue to highlight poor build quality and say that trying to get problems sorted is a constant battle, accusing builders of using delaying tactics and legal threats to keep them quiet.The situation has prompted urgent calls for a dedicated ombudsman to be set up to give more protection to buyers.‘We are very concerned,’ says Paula Higgins, chief executive of campaign group the HomeOwners Alliance. ‘Problems with new-builds are one of our top issues — and things aren’t getting better.‘People think that, like buying a car or a toaster, everything is going to be perfect but the reality can be quite different. The Government knows there’s a significant housing shortage and is imploring developers to build quickly. Quality, it seems, has taken a back seat.’Housebuilding has certainly spiked. Output last year, stimulated by the Government’s Help To Buy initiative, was up 74 per cent compared with four years ago. A Government target of 300,000 new-build properties a year is now within the housebuilders’ sights.  Mr Buller spotted 11 manhole covers on the front lawn. He has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estateBut with this rush to build has come an increase in complaints.While the industry points to the fact that the latest survey of new buyers shows that 86 per cent ‘would recommend their builder to a friend’, others highlight the significant minority who would not. Again, the industry insists it is inevitable there will be faults, but that these get quickly sorted.‘When building something as complex as a new house, using multiple tradespeople, in all weathers, it’s inevitable there are some, usually minor, flaws, such as paint drips or an uneven door,’ says a spokesman for the HBF.‘Builders typically encourage new buyers to produce a list of snags in order to ensure homeowners are fully satisfied with the property once they have had a chance to experience it more thoroughly.’Virtually all new homes are sold with a ten-year warranty. Most of these are covered by the National House Building Council (NHBC), the standard-setting body and main home construction warranty provider for new-builds in the UK.If faults emerge in the first two years, the builder is responsible for fixing them. If there is a dispute, the warranty company adjudicates between the two parties.As Bovis has discovered, failure to deal with these complaints can quickly tarnish a reputation.It was the only national builder awarded two stars out of five in the HBF annual customer satisfaction survey for the year ending September 2017. A two-star rating means that between 30 and 40 per cent of customers would not recommend the builder to a friend. Since then it claims to have turned things around.‘We have made huge changes to our build quality and customer service and have transformed Bovis Homes,’ a spokesman says.But, over on the Facebook page of the Bovis Homes ‘victims’ group, a different picture emerges.Dave Howard, the administrator for the 2,500-strong group, says new people join every week. Many tell him they have given up complaining because of the number of times they have been fobbed off.‘Dealing with Bovis customer service is like hitting your head against a brick wall,’ he says.One dissatisfied customer is 48-year-old Phil Hutchinson, a lecturer in philosophy at Manchester Metropolitan University.At the end of November 2016, he and his partner purchased a £229,000 three-bed townhouse on a development in Sandbach, Cheshire. After moving in, a long list of faults quickly emerged.These included problems with the shower’s drain hot and cold taps wrongly connected a faulty washing machine an oven without a seal that caused the adjoining kitchen units to become scorched and faulty French doors.‘One of the first things we noticed was the stairs,’ he says. ‘We had nails coming through the carpet so we were all bleeding from our feet as we walked up and down.’Complaints to Bovis led to a steady stream of workmen coming to the house. They were all sub-contractors.‘They told us how it worked. People who fit the stairs, that’s all they do. People who do the plastering, that’s all they do.‘So the only person who has responsibility from beginning to end is the site manager.’As more problems emerged, Mr Hutchinson engaged the services of a ‘snagging’ company. It identified more than 180 items that needed rectifying.Ever since, he has been battling with Bovis to get them fixed. As with the original work, the repairs are contracted out. Workmen often leave without achieving anything.He explains: ‘Three damaged internal doors were identified. A year on, only one door has been replaced and that was last week. Every time they come, either the doors earmarked for our house have disappeared, or the doors are more damaged than those they are replacing, or the doors aren’t the right specification. That has happened on seven occasions.’There are also ‘discussions’ about fixing the bouncing floors. These flex, says Mr Hutchinson, because Bovis used joists spaced at 600mm rather than 400mm.‘You walk across the front room and the TV will rock backwards and forwards. In the bedroom, toiletries rattle on the bedside table.’ Most recently, workmen visited the house to replace a damaged kitchen worksurface. When they removed it they discovered a huge hole in the plasterwork in the wall behind from which the upstairs plumbing and pipework emerged.          Thomas, Rhian, Mark, and Holly Buller outside their home, which has been the subject of an ongoing dispute between the family and the developers, Linden HomesNot only is it ‘shoddy workmanship’ but Mr Hutchinson is concerned that it could be a fire risk, funnelling any fire upstairs.‘It’s been appalling,’ he says. ‘I can’t believe in the UK, where we have all these checks and balances, that you have no protection when it comes to the most expensive purchase of your life.’A spokesman for Bovis says it is committed to improving its business and is focusing on its subcontractors — ‘working only with the very best and boosting our engagement with them’.He adds: ‘We apologise to any customer who, like Mr Hutchinson, did not move into the home they deserved in the past, but we are committed to putting things right.‘In those rare instances where things might be disputed, we welcome the involvement of external agencies, such as the NHBC, to objectively assess the issues. We are committed to meeting our obligations in these instances.’One of those forced to involve the NHBC is 43-year-old Victoria Sheader from Stone, Staffordshire. She and her partner purchased a new four-bedroom home from Taylor Wimpey last December.They were particularly taken by the fact that it had a sunny south-facing garden.According to the plans they were shown, a drainage system had been installed beneath it.‘Within weeks we noticed that wherever you trod in the back garden, it filled up with water,’ says Miss Sheader, who works in the financial industry.After digging exploratory holes in the garden, she claims they found a problem with the drainage.But attempts to get Taylor Wimpey to fix the problem — including more than 60 emails and phone calls — have failed. In the end, it was agreed that the NHBC should investigate.After a site visit last week, it concluded that it was up to the builder to carry out drainage works to prevent waterlogging.Miss Sheader is still waiting for a response from Taylor Wimpey.‘It is a beautiful house in a really nice area, but you can hardly ever go outside — it is so disheartening,’ she says. ‘I expected that buying a new-build house would be exciting. Instead, I wish I’d never bought it. It has been a nightmare.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We deliver thousands of high-quality homes across the UK, but there are occasions where we do not meet the high standards that we set ourselves. We apologise for the issues that Ms Sheader has experienced and we are fully committed to resolving these.‘Drainage issues with the garden will be fixed as soon as the scope of works have been agreed with the NHBC and Miss Sheader.’Other examples of continuing problems with quality and customer service are not difficult to find. Three days before Christmas, Bryan Don paid £340,000 to Morris Homes for a new-build home in Garston, Liverpool.But on the day he moved in with his partner and their son he says he found 154 faults.Issues identified by the 42-year-old project manager included a water leak and no grass laid in the back garden. The wardrobe doors wouldn’t shut once clothes were inside — a niggle, yes, but a deeply frustrating one.Mr Don says: ‘It was meant to be a dream home. We walked in and our dreams were spoiled.’A spokesperson for Morris Homes says: ‘As a private housebuilder of more than 70 years’ standing we take the quality of our homes very seriously and we consistently achieve high approval ratings.‘On this occasion we relaxed our strict inspection procedures to accommodate our purchaser’s desire to move in for Christmas.

In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said Israel recently uncovered 55,000 documents and 183 CDs of information from Iran\u0027s \u0027nuclear archives\u0027Mr Netanyahu accused Iran of having a secret plan called ‘Project Amad’, whose goal is to produce five ten-kiloton nuclear weapons.This unverified claim will of course have been music to the ears of Donald Trump and the anti-Iran hawks the President has surrounded himself with in the White House.Even before this dramatically theatrical display from Israel, Mr Trump appeared determined to scrap the controversial nuclear deal next month, because he sees it as being fatally flawed. The deal is still strongly backed by Britain, the EU, Russia, China and the UN-sponsored watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency. All remain adamant that inspections show Iran has and continues to abide by its principles.Indeed, during a visit to the White House last week, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Mr Trump to stick to the agreement – echoing similar pleas by Theresa May and Angela Merkel.          The Israeli leader said that the \u0027atomic archive\u0027 where Iran kept its files was in the Shorabad District of the capital, TehranBut is Mr Trump listening more closely to his old friend Mr Netanyahu?What we do know is that, as the deadline nears for Mr Trump’s decision on whether to re-ratify the nuclear deal, unprecedented threats and counter-threats of death and destruction are being hurled between Tehran and Tel Aviv.British government says it has \u0027never been naive\u0027 about...Share this articleIn the past few weeks, each has promised to destroy the other’s major cities if threatened, raising fears that the proxy war they have been waging in Syria may soon explode into a direct military confrontation.We should remember that over the past few decades Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly, but erroneously, suggested that Iran is just months away from declaring it has developed a nuclear weapon. Still, it is easy to see why he is so paranoid. Since the revolution in 1979 brought the Shia Islam mullahs to power, the Tehran regime has proudly promoted the destruction of Israel as its top foreign policy objective.    During a visit to the White House last week, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Mr Trump to stick to the agreement – echoing similar pleas by Theresa May and Angela MerkelWorse for Israel, the civil war in Syria has resulted in thousands of Iranian fighters joining thousands more militia men from Hezbollah, Iran’s main regional Shia ally, which has already fought numerous wars with Israel.Their ostensible aim was to help Assad fight Islamic State and other Islamist rebel groups, but that brutal experience means they are now battle-hardened, armed to the hilt and entrenched right on the Jewish state’s border.Until now, Russia – which is allied with Assad, Iran and Hezbollah, but also has warm relations with Israel – has played a delicate diplomatic balancing act, backing Israel’s enemies while turning a blind eye to the Jewish state attacks against them in Syria.          Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run outBut Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run out, and he has promised to deliver the advanced S-300 air defence missile system to Assad to help him defend against such aerial attacks. Israel responded by saying that any such system would be destroyed before it could become operational.It is easy to see, then, why the price of oil is soaring on the back of Mr Netanyahu’s claims yesterday. It’s a sign that the international markets are afraid supply will be disrupted by strife and conflict in the region.The great fear for diplomats around the world is that, if Mr Trump does decide to withdraw from the nuclear deal and reimposes sanctions, Israel will launch unilateral strikes against what it says are Iran’s nuclear facilities. That would almost certainly provoke a devastating military response – not just from Tehran, but also its allies in Syria and Lebanon.And if that happens, it will take a massive effort of will to stop America and Russia coming to the aid of their allies – at which point the risks of a global conflict will rise sharply. Once again, the tinder box Middle East threatens to drag two of the world’s great powers to the edge of the abyss. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/23/4BB4DD1600000578-0-image-a-22_1525127609121.jpg","title":"Spotify music downloads reveal mood nation Bank England claim","story":"    Music downloaded from Spotify can give decision-makers an insight into consumer moods, according to the Bank of England’s chief economist‘Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence,’ he said, referring to an important monthly survey in the United States.‘And why stop at music?

And as the financial details of the merger were revealed early yesterday, my phone rang off the hook.Sainsbury’s most senior executives were clearly fearful that regulators and politicians will be more concerned about potential harm to consumers and suppliers than with the positive impact for investors.I was assured by one of the architects of the deal that it must be a ‘win-win’ situation.Since 85 per cent of what the big grocers buy comes from 100 big suppliers, the deal would give the Sainsbury’s-Asda conglomerate added muscle in its dealings.Astonishing moment Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the...Competition watchdog will probe £12bn merger of Sainsbury\u0027s...Share this article    Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe (pictured) wants to win consumer support with the promise of ‘lower prices by 10 per cent on many of the products customers buy regularly’This is not quite true, however, because Walmart will be the biggest shareholder in the new Sainsbury’s-Asda set-up with 42 per cent of the shares and a third of the votes in the company. There is always excitement when a major merger is announced, but experience tells me that when the public-relations machine is running at full tilt, one should never allow spin to outweigh basic economics.Consumers shouldn’t kid themselves that Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe’s 10 per cent price reductions will necessarily mean an overall cut in the cost in a shopping basket across the huge range of branded, own label and fresh produce goods offered by the new group.Other concerns were aired in Parliament yesterday, where MPs expressed fears not only about job security, but also on whether supermarkets would close in their areas.Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long run. The thinking is that, if there are only Sainsbury’s and Asda stores in a given area, they could effectively operate a monopoly and so one would have to be sold off to a rival supermarket chain.Analysis suggests that, as a result of such overlap, as many as 75 Asda stores will have to be disposed of if this merger is to have any chance of winning approval.Such a large estment could undermine the financial rationale for the deal, and could take years to complete at a time when the whole retail sector is under stress. It is suggested that the new merged company will seek to keep the Sainsbury and Asda brands separate, with the former maintaining its focus on quality, and Asda continuing to push cheaper own-brand products which will compete with the upstart discounters like Lidl and Aldi.But Sainsbury’s tried this with Dutch discounter Netto, and ended up losing £20million after having to close a series of stores where the brands had been sited together.    Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long runLargely the brainchild of Mike Coupe at Sainsbury’s and his ex-colleague Dave Cheesewright at Asda, this merger has been two years in the making. Both firms have been trying to figure out how to deal with the huge global threat from Amazon, which arguably has the best logistics, warehousing and delivery technology, as well as almost unlimited financial resources.Amazon is challenging Asda owner Walmart in the US with the purchase of bricks-and-mortar retail firm Whole Foods Market, and starting to make incursions in the UK, too. Sainsbury’s argues it is in a strong position to integrate Asda because both companies have embraced the best of new technology.Be that as it may, we should heed the lessons of last week’s disastrous IT meltdown at the TSB – that technological change can be chaotic if companies get it wrong.Sainsbury’s is still digesting IT and distribution changes that came with the purchase of Argos owner Home Retail Group two years ago.The Sainsbury’s-Asda merger gives the impression of being a sensible deal designed to create a new leader in British shopping. But like many big mergers, it is a roll of the dice designed in part to cover-up grave shortcomings in the strategy of the managements concerned. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/16/4B92989300000578-0-image-m-116_1524758274646.jpg","title":"Land value levy cost families 10 000 year","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn, who has praised the Labour Land Campaign (LLC) which calls for a new levy based on the value of land a home is built onPub angers community by putting parking meters in car park...Council unveils plan to restrict foreign languages on...Share this articleLLC suggests charging as much as £96,534 a year for a three-bedroom home in the richest part of London. Residents of Band D homes in parts of Manchester would pay £11,239 per year and those in Bristol £9,567.Critics warn it would hit London and the South-East the hardest, putting at risk lower-income households and those who bought their ex-council houses at a discount under the right-to-buy scheme.The LLC is not affiliated to the Labour Party, and a party spokesman said a land value tax was not Labour policy."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/00/4BB3602000000578-0-image-m-18_1525131196230.jpg","title":"Pharmacy grade Xanax sold openly Instagram","story":"    Reporters discovered that a pharmacy-grade version of the highly-addictive drug was being sold on InstagramOne pharmacist in central London, Anatolijus Kostiukevicius, sold Xanax and the highly addictive painkiller tramadol to an undercover reporter without a prescription.

This is what happened to me.I can trace its beginnings to my older sister’s hen do, surrounded by her beautiful friends. They all had perfect jobs, perfect skin, perfect bodies. I’d just finished drama school, was in debt and living with my parents, and had no plan.Later, chatting to a friend, I said I wasn’t feeling good: bloated, foggy brain, generally ‘bleugh’. She recommended a ‘clean living’ book. ‘It will change your life,’ she said. ‘It teaches you how to be kind to your body, your skin, your weight, your mind, your energy levels, everything.’ An easy sell.I was a healthy size 8-10.  Daniella posted flattering photos on social media, despite suffering from an eating disorderI’d been diagnosed with coeliac disease (an auto-immune condition where the body reacts to gluten) a few years earlier, so I had already cut gluten out of my diet, but otherwise I enjoyed food and ate a varied diet.But the book insisted I cut out dairy, then sugar and then meat and grains.Then, it promised, I would be clean. I would feel better.Why getting a dog is so good for you: People raised in...Should you be worried about E. coli in your lunchtime salad?...Which tea to drink to make you healthier, happier and...A stick-on skin patch for hay fever that blocks the release...Share this articleI joined my local gym, too — and along with my new diet, it gave me a much sought-after routine. It was around this time I downloaded the social media app Instagram. I started posting about my progress online and got endless compliments. I finally felt I was in control.And I was supported by a whole community. Bloggers such as Deliciously Ella, Honestly Healthy, Clean Eating Alice — they were all there to inspire me. The weight dropped off. It became my religion.Then, a theatre show I’d created and acted in transferred to Australia. This is where my ‘clean’ lifestyle went up a gear. My days consisted of exercise first thing, brunch (so I didn’t have to eat breakfast and lunch) of avocado and eggs, and later a vegetable-filled dinner.  Daniella was inspired by bloggers such as Deliciously Ella (left) and Clean Eating Alice (right) When I came back to London, I couldn’t get off the wellness treadmill. I started ghost-writing for ‘clean living’ brands, developing recipes. I even launched a brand of granola.The job was the perfect way to retain total control: alcohol was banned from events, every menu was free from sugar and gluten, and detailed descriptions of exercise routines were accepted as dinner party conversation.After about six months of eating clean, my sister and mum voiced their concerns to me, but I ignored them.Even when a wellness expert I was writing for took me to one side and said my lifestyle was getting ‘excessive’ . . . I didn’t listen.It was only in November 2016 that I began to reassess. My sister announced she was pregnant — it was a sharp wake-up call reminding me that I hadn’t had a period in over two years.  Daniella moved to Australia where her eating disorder worsenedI went to the gynaecologist who said that although my weight was within the ‘normal’ range, my oestrogen level was non-existent. He explained that to conserve energy, my body had stopped releasing the hormone.I now know that I was in the grip of orthorexia an eating disorder characterised as an unhealthy obsession with healthy living. The doctor didn’t diagnose this specifically, because it is not yet officially recognised by medical bodies.But once I had explained my lifestyle to him, it was clear my disorder was far from rare. ‘If you were a plant,’ he said, ‘you’d be withered and on your way out. Your body hasn’t been nourished in a long time. You need to learn to love yourself again. What are you scared of?’I hated the question. I was scared of the thoughts in my head, scared of being a failure.I knew I had to change if I wanted to bring my periods back. I felt angry at the wellness world. I’d spent so much time, money and headspace obsessively following the rules, only for them to make me sick.          Daniella would eat just avocado and eggs for brunch and vegetables for dinnerThe gynaecologist suggested therapy, but I wasn’t ready for deep reflection (and the NHS waiting list was long), so I turned to a group I found on Facebook called ‘No period, now what?’ Here, I found hundreds of women like me. Many had fallen into orthorexic habits.Their advice was simple: ‘Let go’. No rules, no recipes, no detoxes, no cleanses, no selfies.I started with small, incremental steps. I’d miss one day of exercise, I’d have porridge for breakfast instead of a smoothie. Then, I’d let friends choose where we went for dinner. I ate carbs, real carbs.I hated seeing my body change. My hard-earned abs turned to soft rolls. I had bursts of rage and deep sadness. I felt like a failure, mentally and physically.Each month I went back to the fertility clinic for blood tests. I’d be surrounded by women who were hoping to get pregnant I was just hoping to feel like a woman again.It took six weeks before my oestrogen level rose. After four months my period came back, just in time for opening night of my new show, Hear Me Raw.I wanted the production to reveal the dirty truth behind the clean living movement.Because despite how it might have looked on Instagram, I had never felt less well. The so-called wellness industry isn’t really selling wellness, is it? It’s the diet industry dressed up in candy-coloured phrases of empowerment. And it’s making us sick."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/08/4B90A55000000578-5676811-image-a-8_1525159533828.jpg","title":"New scan ocean floor sign MH370","story":"    Ocean Infinity (pictured), the American technology company, scoured nearly 80,000 square kilometers of Indian Ocean bed          The private vessel was searching of down plane MH370 (pictured) which vanished in March 8 2014Underwater photos of \u0027sunken treasure\u0027 sparks MH370...Share this articleOcean Infinity, the American technology company conducting the latest search, said in an update Monday it had scanned up to 1,300 square kilometers per day since launching its mission far off the west coast of Australia in late January. It had searched both inside and outside an area identified by Australian authorities.\u0027Whilst it\u0027s disappointing there has been no sign of MH370 in the Australian Transport Safety Bureau search area and further north, there is still some search time remaining,\u0027 Ocean Infinity chief executive officer Oliver Plunkett said in a statement.

But it would have given the government a way of knowing through those biometric ID cards who was here legally and who wasn’t.” Pushed again on whether he supported ID cards, Mr Gardiner replied: “We need to have much better ways of tracking people through the system.”Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague today added his voice to calls for ID cards. “It would be worth thinking again about bringing in universal identity cards,” Lord Hague wrote in his Telegraph column. “We Conservatives were against this a decade ago, but times have moved on.” Yesterday Alan Johnson, and Charles Clarke, who both ran the Home Office under Labour in the 2000s, argued that biometric ID cards were the ‘best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity’.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on the local election campaign trail yesterday, voted against ID cards during the 2000s Ken Clarke, who was Tory Home Secretary in the early 1990s, also said ID cards would help deal with illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East.However, it is understood Theresa May has ruled out bringing in such a scheme, which critics say would breach civil liberties.A Whitehall source said: ‘This Government is not going to introduce mandatory ID cards. It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary. Only around 15,000 cards were ever distributed.A law abolishing ID cards and the national identity register was the first to come out of the Home Office during the coalition government.At the time Mrs May said it would ‘begin the process of reversing the erosion of civil liberties and restoring freedoms’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/18/4B51364900000578-5635117-The_bollards_can_spray_water_mist_when_a_pedestrian_attempts_to_-a-3_1524159143500.jpg","title":"Chinas latest jaywalker catcher humiliates pedestrians spray WATER road crossings","story":"    A new system has been installed as trial to catch jaywalking offenders in central China          The bollards can spray water mist when a pedestrian attempts to cross the red lightVideo emerged online showing four yellow bollards, measuring 1.6 foot tall, set up at the pavement in Daye of Hubei Province. Connected to the traffic system, the bollards can remind the pedestrians when the lights are changing.\u0027Don\u0027t say you haven\u0027t been warned!\u0027 Beijing holds live-fire...I woof you!

The kids can’t play outside in nice weather, because that’s when it’s worst. We can’t have people over for barbecues because it’s embarrassing. Who wants to sit outside in those conditions?’A very good question and one that he has been putting to Linden Homes, the estate’s developer, for the past 18 months.Mr Buller claims that when he bought the property he was never informed about what lurked beneath his lawn nor shown any drainage or sewage plans.The property was still a ‘building site’ when he first viewed it, and he says he felt under pressure to rush the purchase.‘We made an offer of £700,000 and it was accepted, but we were told we had to complete within two-and-a-half weeks if we wanted the deal at that price. The day I moved in, they were only just laying the grass as I pulled up.’It was not until a month later that Mr Buller spotted manhole covers on his front lawn.Linden Homes disputes his version of events and the two sides are now at loggerheads. Mr Buller has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estate and threatening legal action against Linden Homes.While his behaviour may seem extreme, Linden is not the only builder to come in for criticism. Pressure to fulfil government targets for building new homes has resulted in floods of complaints from customers. Problems include bouncing floors, leaks, missing insulation, poor drainage and unfinished gardens — as well as some cases of appalling customer service.Homeowner is mocked after putting his property on Rightmove¿...Divorcing naked gardeners are forced to drop price of their...Share this articleThis time last year one company, Bovis, was singled out for particular criticism. After it was forced to apologise, it set aside £10 million to pay for repairs and promised to cut back from building 6,000 homes a year to 3,500.The Home Builders Federation (HBF), the industry’s representative body, admitted that pressure to build new homes quickly had resulted in short-term problems. But it claims a corner has been turned and customer satisfaction is on the rise.Others are far from convinced. Across social media, groups charting the complaints of buyers against major construction firms run to thousands of members.They continue to highlight poor build quality and say that trying to get problems sorted is a constant battle, accusing builders of using delaying tactics and legal threats to keep them quiet.The situation has prompted urgent calls for a dedicated ombudsman to be set up to give more protection to buyers.‘We are very concerned,’ says Paula Higgins, chief executive of campaign group the HomeOwners Alliance. ‘Problems with new-builds are one of our top issues — and things aren’t getting better.‘People think that, like buying a car or a toaster, everything is going to be perfect but the reality can be quite different. The Government knows there’s a significant housing shortage and is imploring developers to build quickly. Quality, it seems, has taken a back seat.’Housebuilding has certainly spiked. Output last year, stimulated by the Government’s Help To Buy initiative, was up 74 per cent compared with four years ago. A Government target of 300,000 new-build properties a year is now within the housebuilders’ sights.  Mr Buller spotted 11 manhole covers on the front lawn. He has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estateBut with this rush to build has come an increase in complaints.While the industry points to the fact that the latest survey of new buyers shows that 86 per cent ‘would recommend their builder to a friend’, others highlight the significant minority who would not. Again, the industry insists it is inevitable there will be faults, but that these get quickly sorted.‘When building something as complex as a new house, using multiple tradespeople, in all weathers, it’s inevitable there are some, usually minor, flaws, such as paint drips or an uneven door,’ says a spokesman for the HBF.‘Builders typically encourage new buyers to produce a list of snags in order to ensure homeowners are fully satisfied with the property once they have had a chance to experience it more thoroughly.’Virtually all new homes are sold with a ten-year warranty. Most of these are covered by the National House Building Council (NHBC), the standard-setting body and main home construction warranty provider for new-builds in the UK.If faults emerge in the first two years, the builder is responsible for fixing them. If there is a dispute, the warranty company adjudicates between the two parties.As Bovis has discovered, failure to deal with these complaints can quickly tarnish a reputation.It was the only national builder awarded two stars out of five in the HBF annual customer satisfaction survey for the year ending September 2017. A two-star rating means that between 30 and 40 per cent of customers would not recommend the builder to a friend. Since then it claims to have turned things around.‘We have made huge changes to our build quality and customer service and have transformed Bovis Homes,’ a spokesman says.But, over on the Facebook page of the Bovis Homes ‘victims’ group, a different picture emerges.Dave Howard, the administrator for the 2,500-strong group, says new people join every week. Many tell him they have given up complaining because of the number of times they have been fobbed off.‘Dealing with Bovis customer service is like hitting your head against a brick wall,’ he says.One dissatisfied customer is 48-year-old Phil Hutchinson, a lecturer in philosophy at Manchester Metropolitan University.At the end of November 2016, he and his partner purchased a £229,000 three-bed townhouse on a development in Sandbach, Cheshire. After moving in, a long list of faults quickly emerged.These included problems with the shower’s drain hot and cold taps wrongly connected a faulty washing machine an oven without a seal that caused the adjoining kitchen units to become scorched and faulty French doors.‘One of the first things we noticed was the stairs,’ he says. ‘We had nails coming through the carpet so we were all bleeding from our feet as we walked up and down.’Complaints to Bovis led to a steady stream of workmen coming to the house. They were all sub-contractors.‘They told us how it worked. People who fit the stairs, that’s all they do. People who do the plastering, that’s all they do.‘So the only person who has responsibility from beginning to end is the site manager.’As more problems emerged, Mr Hutchinson engaged the services of a ‘snagging’ company. It identified more than 180 items that needed rectifying.Ever since, he has been battling with Bovis to get them fixed. As with the original work, the repairs are contracted out. Workmen often leave without achieving anything.He explains: ‘Three damaged internal doors were identified. A year on, only one door has been replaced and that was last week. Every time they come, either the doors earmarked for our house have disappeared, or the doors are more damaged than those they are replacing, or the doors aren’t the right specification. That has happened on seven occasions.’There are also ‘discussions’ about fixing the bouncing floors. These flex, says Mr Hutchinson, because Bovis used joists spaced at 600mm rather than 400mm.‘You walk across the front room and the TV will rock backwards and forwards. In the bedroom, toiletries rattle on the bedside table.’ Most recently, workmen visited the house to replace a damaged kitchen worksurface. When they removed it they discovered a huge hole in the plasterwork in the wall behind from which the upstairs plumbing and pipework emerged.          Thomas, Rhian, Mark, and Holly Buller outside their home, which has been the subject of an ongoing dispute between the family and the developers, Linden HomesNot only is it ‘shoddy workmanship’ but Mr Hutchinson is concerned that it could be a fire risk, funnelling any fire upstairs.‘It’s been appalling,’ he says. ‘I can’t believe in the UK, where we have all these checks and balances, that you have no protection when it comes to the most expensive purchase of your life.’A spokesman for Bovis says it is committed to improving its business and is focusing on its subcontractors — ‘working only with the very best and boosting our engagement with them’.He adds: ‘We apologise to any customer who, like Mr Hutchinson, did not move into the home they deserved in the past, but we are committed to putting things right.‘In those rare instances where things might be disputed, we welcome the involvement of external agencies, such as the NHBC, to objectively assess the issues. We are committed to meeting our obligations in these instances.’One of those forced to involve the NHBC is 43-year-old Victoria Sheader from Stone, Staffordshire. She and her partner purchased a new four-bedroom home from Taylor Wimpey last December.They were particularly taken by the fact that it had a sunny south-facing garden.According to the plans they were shown, a drainage system had been installed beneath it.‘Within weeks we noticed that wherever you trod in the back garden, it filled up with water,’ says Miss Sheader, who works in the financial industry.After digging exploratory holes in the garden, she claims they found a problem with the drainage.But attempts to get Taylor Wimpey to fix the problem — including more than 60 emails and phone calls — have failed. In the end, it was agreed that the NHBC should investigate.After a site visit last week, it concluded that it was up to the builder to carry out drainage works to prevent waterlogging.Miss Sheader is still waiting for a response from Taylor Wimpey.‘It is a beautiful house in a really nice area, but you can hardly ever go outside — it is so disheartening,’ she says. ‘I expected that buying a new-build house would be exciting. Instead, I wish I’d never bought it. It has been a nightmare.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We deliver thousands of high-quality homes across the UK, but there are occasions where we do not meet the high standards that we set ourselves. We apologise for the issues that Ms Sheader has experienced and we are fully committed to resolving these.‘Drainage issues with the garden will be fixed as soon as the scope of works have been agreed with the NHBC and Miss Sheader.’Other examples of continuing problems with quality and customer service are not difficult to find. Three days before Christmas, Bryan Don paid £340,000 to Morris Homes for a new-build home in Garston, Liverpool.But on the day he moved in with his partner and their son he says he found 154 faults.Issues identified by the 42-year-old project manager included a water leak and no grass laid in the back garden. The wardrobe doors wouldn’t shut once clothes were inside — a niggle, yes, but a deeply frustrating one.Mr Don says: ‘It was meant to be a dream home. We walked in and our dreams were spoiled.’A spokesperson for Morris Homes says: ‘As a private housebuilder of more than 70 years’ standing we take the quality of our homes very seriously and we consistently achieve high approval ratings.‘On this occasion we relaxed our strict inspection procedures to accommodate our purchaser’s desire to move in for Christmas. It was accepted that there would be minor post-completion remedials which the purchaser accepted. The images recently reported in no way reflect the property on the day of occupation.’As for Mr Buller’s issues with his sewage plant, a satisfactory resolution looks some way away.A spokesperson for Linden Homes says that when the Bullers purchased their home it was in a ‘virtually finished state’ and that they had requested an early legal completion. She says the price they paid ‘reflects the overall amenity of the plot’.She adds that the manhole covers on the plot would have been ‘clearly visible’ at the time the property was reserved.She says: ‘Mr and Mrs Buller have complained of a “sewage odour” to the rear of their property. There are no foul sewers to the rear associated with the Heathlands development.‘There are however existing foul and surface water sewers, which are the subject of imminent upgrade works by Thames Water, following complaints of unpleasant smells from residents. We have offered to commission an air quality assessment to establish the source of any odours around the property.‘In the unlikely event that the survey indicates that odours from the pump station exceed acceptable levels, we will undertake any necessary works required.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/23/4B7E48E700000578-0-image-a-17_1524783490880.jpg","title":"TSB closed branches early weekend","story":"    TSB closed some of its branches early over the weekend and turned off the lights to avoid having to deal with irate customers, it has been claimedHalf of its customers were still locked out of their online accounts last night – ten days after the bank began an ill-fated systems upgrade. Many of the 1.9million customers affected have been unable to make bank transfer payments, meaning vital bills have gone unpaid.TSB’s problems stem from a failed switch-over from the IT system of its old owner Lloyds Banking Group to one owned by its Spanish parent company Sabadell.TSB chief says the bank\u0027s IT chaos is bringing company to...One million TSB customers are STILL locked out of their...Share this articleThe bank provoked more fury as branches closed early on Saturday – the first day many workers were able to visit a branch since problems started.Branches in Hull, Lincoln, Clifton in Nottingham, Greenock, Falkirk and Elgin in Scotland were reported to have shut early.TSB in Hull closed at 1pm on Saturday when it usually shuts at 4pm.The branch then directed customers to its nearest branches 46 miles away in Doncaster or Retford in Nottinghamshire, which is 65 miles away.

In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said Israel recently uncovered 55,000 documents and 183 CDs of information from Iran\u0027s \u0027nuclear archives\u0027Mr Netanyahu accused Iran of having a secret plan called ‘Project Amad’, whose goal is to produce five ten-kiloton nuclear weapons.This unverified claim will of course have been music to the ears of Donald Trump and the anti-Iran hawks the President has surrounded himself with in the White House.Even before this dramatically theatrical display from Israel, Mr Trump appeared determined to scrap the controversial nuclear deal next month, because he sees it as being fatally flawed.

The Israeli leader said that the \u0027atomic archive\u0027 where Iran kept its files was in the Shorabad District of the capital, TehranBut is Mr Trump listening more closely to his old friend Mr Netanyahu?What we do know is that, as the deadline nears for Mr Trump’s decision on whether to re-ratify the nuclear deal, unprecedented threats and counter-threats of death and destruction are being hurled between Tehran and Tel Aviv.British government says it has \u0027never been naive\u0027 about...Share this articleIn the past few weeks, each has promised to destroy the other’s major cities if threatened, raising fears that the proxy war they have been waging in Syria may soon explode into a direct military confrontation.We should remember that over the past few decades Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly, but erroneously, suggested that Iran is just months away from declaring it has developed a nuclear weapon. Still, it is easy to see why he is so paranoid. Since the revolution in 1979 brought the Shia Islam mullahs to power, the Tehran regime has proudly promoted the destruction of Israel as its top foreign policy objective.    During a visit to the White House last week, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Mr Trump to stick to the agreement – echoing similar pleas by Theresa May and Angela MerkelWorse for Israel, the civil war in Syria has resulted in thousands of Iranian fighters joining thousands more militia men from Hezbollah, Iran’s main regional Shia ally, which has already fought numerous wars with Israel.Their ostensible aim was to help Assad fight Islamic State and other Islamist rebel groups, but that brutal experience means they are now battle-hardened, armed to the hilt and entrenched right on the Jewish state’s border.Until now, Russia – which is allied with Assad, Iran and Hezbollah, but also has warm relations with Israel – has played a delicate diplomatic balancing act, backing Israel’s enemies while turning a blind eye to the Jewish state attacks against them in Syria.          Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run outBut Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run out, and he has promised to deliver the advanced S-300 air defence missile system to Assad to help him defend against such aerial attacks. Israel responded by saying that any such system would be destroyed before it could become operational.It is easy to see, then, why the price of oil is soaring on the back of Mr Netanyahu’s claims yesterday. It’s a sign that the international markets are afraid supply will be disrupted by strife and conflict in the region.The great fear for diplomats around the world is that, if Mr Trump does decide to withdraw from the nuclear deal and reimposes sanctions, Israel will launch unilateral strikes against what it says are Iran’s nuclear facilities. That would almost certainly provoke a devastating military response – not just from Tehran, but also its allies in Syria and Lebanon.And if that happens, it will take a massive effort of will to stop America and Russia coming to the aid of their allies – at which point the risks of a global conflict will rise sharply. Once again, the tinder box Middle East threatens to drag two of the world’s great powers to the edge of the abyss. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/23/4BB4DD1600000578-0-image-a-22_1525127609121.jpg","title":"Spotify music downloads reveal mood nation Bank England claim","story":"    Music downloaded from Spotify can give decision-makers an insight into consumer moods, according to the Bank of England’s chief economist‘Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence,’ he said, referring to an important monthly survey in the United States.‘And why stop at music?

And as the financial details of the merger were revealed early yesterday, my phone rang off the hook.Sainsbury’s most senior executives were clearly fearful that regulators and politicians will be more concerned about potential harm to consumers and suppliers than with the positive impact for investors.I was assured by one of the architects of the deal that it must be a ‘win-win’ situation.Since 85 per cent of what the big grocers buy comes from 100 big suppliers, the deal would give the Sainsbury’s-Asda conglomerate added muscle in its dealings.Astonishing moment Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the...Competition watchdog will probe £12bn merger of Sainsbury\u0027s...Share this article    Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe (pictured) wants to win consumer support with the promise of ‘lower prices by 10 per cent on many of the products customers buy regularly’This is not quite true, however, because Walmart will be the biggest shareholder in the new Sainsbury’s-Asda set-up with 42 per cent of the shares and a third of the votes in the company. There is always excitement when a major merger is announced, but experience tells me that when the public-relations machine is running at full tilt, one should never allow spin to outweigh basic economics.Consumers shouldn’t kid themselves that Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe’s 10 per cent price reductions will necessarily mean an overall cut in the cost in a shopping basket across the huge range of branded, own label and fresh produce goods offered by the new group.Other concerns were aired in Parliament yesterday, where MPs expressed fears not only about job security, but also on whether supermarkets would close in their areas.Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long run. The thinking is that, if there are only Sainsbury’s and Asda stores in a given area, they could effectively operate a monopoly and so one would have to be sold off to a rival supermarket chain.Analysis suggests that, as a result of such overlap, as many as 75 Asda stores will have to be disposed of if this merger is to have any chance of winning approval.Such a large estment could undermine the financial rationale for the deal, and could take years to complete at a time when the whole retail sector is under stress. It is suggested that the new merged company will seek to keep the Sainsbury and Asda brands separate, with the former maintaining its focus on quality, and Asda continuing to push cheaper own-brand products which will compete with the upstart discounters like Lidl and Aldi.But Sainsbury’s tried this with Dutch discounter Netto, and ended up losing £20million after having to close a series of stores where the brands had been sited together.    Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long runLargely the brainchild of Mike Coupe at Sainsbury’s and his ex-colleague Dave Cheesewright at Asda, this merger has been two years in the making. Both firms have been trying to figure out how to deal with the huge global threat from Amazon, which arguably has the best logistics, warehousing and delivery technology, as well as almost unlimited financial resources.Amazon is challenging Asda owner Walmart in the US with the purchase of bricks-and-mortar retail firm Whole Foods Market, and starting to make incursions in the UK, too. Sainsbury’s argues it is in a strong position to integrate Asda because both companies have embraced the best of new technology.Be that as it may, we should heed the lessons of last week’s disastrous IT meltdown at the TSB – that technological change can be chaotic if companies get it wrong.Sainsbury’s is still digesting IT and distribution changes that came with the purchase of Argos owner Home Retail Group two years ago.The Sainsbury’s-Asda merger gives the impression of being a sensible deal designed to create a new leader in British shopping. But like many big mergers, it is a roll of the dice designed in part to cover-up grave shortcomings in the strategy of the managements concerned. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/08/4BAB49F100000578-0-image-a-2_1524987300622.jpg","title":"London born scientist flies Swiss clinic end life regrets having lived 104","story":"    Australia\u0027s oldest scientist , Dr David Goodall (pictured), wants to fly to Switzerland to end his life          Dr Goodall (pictured middle) does not have a terminal illness but greatly regrets having lived to 104Dr Goodall was born in London in 1914, and is an eminent botanist and ecologist. He came to Australia to in 1948, taking up a lecturing position at the University of Melbourne.   Dr Goodall celebrated his 104th birthday in early April and has since decided it is time to access voluntarily euthanasia in Switzerland.\u0027People who are gravely ill should have their pain relieved,...Landmark euthanasia bill passes as Victoria becomes the...Share this articleWest Australia is still in the process of introducing voluntary euthanasia laws which would be restricted to people with a terminal illness. Premier Mark McGowan said the government would not assist Dr Goodall due to the fact he is not suffering from a terminal illness.

But it would have given the government a way of knowing through those biometric ID cards who was here legally and who wasn’t.” Pushed again on whether he supported ID cards, Mr Gardiner replied: “We need to have much better ways of tracking people through the system.”Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague today added his voice to calls for ID cards. “It would be worth thinking again about bringing in universal identity cards,” Lord Hague wrote in his Telegraph column. “We Conservatives were against this a decade ago, but times have moved on.” Yesterday Alan Johnson, and Charles Clarke, who both ran the Home Office under Labour in the 2000s, argued that biometric ID cards were the ‘best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity’.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on the local election campaign trail yesterday, voted against ID cards during the 2000s Ken Clarke, who was Tory Home Secretary in the early 1990s, also said ID cards would help deal with illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East.However, it is understood Theresa May has ruled out bringing in such a scheme, which critics say would breach civil liberties.A Whitehall source said: ‘This Government is not going to introduce mandatory ID cards. It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary. Only around 15,000 cards were ever distributed.A law abolishing ID cards and the national identity register was the first to come out of the Home Office during the coalition government.At the time Mrs May said it would ‘begin the process of reversing the erosion of civil liberties and restoring freedoms’. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa575d6bb00721058a9a6af7e4c46b8455d02fc6/0_1490_6149_3690/master/6149.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bd3fcea1adec0e7eedf42a4f64f0e75","title":"big picture jonas bendiksen sleeping baby home","story":"Last year, a group of photographers from the Magnum agency were invited to reflect on the idea of “home”, each using the same medium-format camera.

In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party.

O’Connell’s book saw off competition that included the Nigerian author Ayòbámi Adébáyò, nominated for Stay With Me, a novel about sickle cell disease, and Sigrid Rausing’s memoir about the impact of addiction on her family, Mayhem.Chair of judges Edmund de Waal called To Be a Machine a “passionate, entertaining and cogent examination of those who would choose to live for ever”.To Be a Machine sees the 38-year-old O’Connell meet with those working to conquer mortality through technology – from the self-proclaimed cyborgs who insert tech implants beneath their skin, to the developers trying to translate human minds into code. Exploring the beliefs and work of several high-profile transhumanists, including PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, inventor Elon Musk and Google’s head of engineering Ray Kurzweil, O’Connell also examines the philosophy and science behind the movement, as well as the opportunities and concerns it may create in the future.“What are my chances, would you say, of living to 1,000?” the author asks gerontologist Aubrey de Grey. “I would say perhaps a little better than fifty-fifty,” de Grey replies. “It’s very much dependent on the level of funding.”De Waal said: “Mark O’Connell brilliantly examines issues of technology and singularity. In doing so he brings into focus timely issues about mortality, what it might mean to be a machine and what it truly means to be human. It is also unequivocally readable, in that what it does is address hugely complicated areas of new science to do with AI and ethics, simultaneously. That’s very remarkable, to be able to traverse bits of cutting-edge scientific research and make something that is funny, engaged, cogent and lucid, all at the same time.”O’Connell, a journalist, essayist and literary critic, “hasn’t got multiple PhDs in this area,” said de Waal. “What he does have, which is critical, is an absolutely ferocious, forensic, enquiring mind. He drills down into what people are saying and gets them to reveal all kinds of complicated and ambiguous aspects to do with their desires and their aspirations. He looks at scientific discoveries through the messiness of human desire. That’s really difficult to do.”Previous winners of the Wellcome prize include Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, and Marion Coutts’s The Iceberg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77809a67d02f46aa4c56171968bf02c3533915d/0_228_5116_3070/master/5116.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d52648b897edfaa80c76eed9751530","title":"municipal dreams john boughton review council housing","story":"In the Conservatives’ successful general election campaign of 1951, the party manifesto declared that housing was “the first of the social services”. Two years later, under the housing minister Harold Macmillan, the Tory government built more council homes in a single year than any government before or since. For Macmillan, as for politicians including Neville Chamberlain, Nye Bevan, Enoch Powell and the Victorian Lord Salisbury, public housing was a stepping stone to political fame, sometimes to the office of prime minister.Times changed. At least since the time of Margaret Thatcher, the Tories have made themselves opponents of council housing and champions of private ownership. Until recently, housing receded from the centre of political debate. And I\u0026nbsphope that the mediocrities who have sometimes been housing ministers in recent years never make it to No\u0026nbsp10.But the consequences of Thatcher’s shift, which was never seriously challenged by Labour governments, have finally made politicians worry again about housing. A new ide has emerged between owner-occupying haves and renting have-nots, one that separates the country by age and region as well as by wealth. As the demographic of have-nots matures and expands, so there are crucial votes to be had in addressing what is widely accepted to be a housing\u0026nbspcrisis.Boughton is the author of a blog, also called Municipal Dreams, in which he regularly posts accounts of inidual housing estates in which detailed knowledge combines with the voices of residents. His sympathies are clear – he was a Labour “foot soldier” in the long years of Tory government up to 1997 and a believer in the idea of council housing – but he is also fair-minded. While he thinks that “the legacy of our early municipal reformers is unjustly neglected and often unfairly maligned”, he accepts that “there were failures and missteps as well as successes”.His book shows that council housing is the ever-changing outcome of complex and competing forces. In its early decades, it tended to serve the better-off working classes, leaving the slum-dwellers at the bottom of the heap no better off. It has been seen as serving a general need, something like a National Health Service for housing, and as a\u0026nbspservice of last resort for those with no other options. Fashions in its architectural form have fluctuated – from suburban “cottage estates” to tower blocks.Some issues endure. The problem of what is now called dependency culture was raised almost as soon as council housing was invented, when it was objected that too-pleasant homes would make the British workman “ornamental”. There has been an enduring concern, expressed by both left and right, that neighbourhoods should be “mixed” or “mingled”, rather than ghettoes of a single class. There is a recurring anxiety, derided by Boughton, that “communities” might not be created in an appropriate way.Council housing has been shaped by national and local politicians, by construction companies, architects and, sometimes, by the people who live and have lived in it. A\u0026nbspsuccession of acts of parliament and policy directives, expertly navigated by Boughton, have had profound and sometimes unintended consequences on the way millions of people live. The Conservative minister Duncan Sandys, whose 1956 Housing Subsidies Act introduced incentives for building tall, had more influence on the rise of tower blocks than the man usually credited or blamed for them, the French-Swiss architect Le\u0026nbspCorbusier.In the 1940s, planning and reconstruction were passionately and widely discussed. Thomas Sharp’s 1940 book Town Planning sold 250,000 copies, more than any other on the subject has done before or since. There was a town planning group among the prisoners in the second world war Stalag Luft III prison camp, the one in The Great Escape – a detail less appealing to the makers of the movie than Steve McQueen’s motorbike.The conventional narrative is that this idealism went sour, that utopia turned to hell, that residents who delighted in the luxury of indoor toilets and central heating soon found themselves living in “sink estates”, “concrete jungles” and “muggers’ paradises”. Architects’ megalomaniac fantasies, combined with the municipal Stalinism inherent in the very notion of council housing were to blame. Boughton rebuts this. Where problems arose, he says, they were more often the result of mass unemployment brought about by the collapse of traditional industries, together with the “residualisation” caused by policies that assign council housing only to the most\u0026nbspdesperate.He notes, too, that homely, low-rise estates, such as Blackbird Leys in Oxford or Meadow Well in North Shields, were as prone to violence and other social problems as tower\u0026nbspblocks.Boughton believes that, if you look past the headline-grabbing failures, council housing has “provided a decent and secure home” to nearly all those who have lived in it.

It’s the logical endpoint for celebrity endorsements: Woody and Buzz Lightyear are selling broadband, the Muppets are selling loaves of bread, James Corden is selling anything he can get his hands on – why shouldn’t Bob get in on the action?But I think Dylan’s missed a trick going with whiskey and not something like Kwik Fit. I can see the advert now: “How many roads must a man drive down, before he takes advantage of a half-price tyre change (subject to terms and conditions, see in store for details)?”To be fair to Dylan, he’s not just slapping his name on the product and taking the cash (what I believe is now known in the industry as a “doing a Kevin Bacon”). Whiskey is clearly something he takes seriously, and he’s personally and rigorously tasted his new brand, “Heaven’s Door” (which maybe explains why he’s been so difficult to get hold of). But all the same, there’s something quite sobering about Dylan’s move into alcoholic marketing.Consumer culture is all about monetising the name, even if the name is virulently opposed to the culture. It’s hard to escape the idea that Dylan’s whiskey is a drinkable version of a mass-produced Che Guevara T-shirt – a way for consumerism to make money off of the people who hate consumerism (or at least want to show everyone they hate consumerism). Perhaps this was always what was going to happen to a revolutionary voice like Dylan: to mangle a quote from The Dark Knight, you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a whiskey spokesman.The reason celebrity endorsements particularly stick in my throat, like a subpar bourbon from an inferior 1960s musician, is that they are irritatingly effective. I had never considered buying a probiotic yoghurt before I saw the actor Martine McCutcheon holding an Activia and rubbing her tummy in a satisfied, non-bloated manner – now I eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I didn’t really care about skin care until I saw an advert with the footballer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain putting on some Nivea – now I use it all the time. If anything my face is too moisturised: if someone tries to kiss me on the cheek their lips slip right off my face.I still trust brands with a recognisable spokesperson more than others, even though deep down I know that these things are a scam. Why do they work? Maybe, depressingly, it’s because we have a subconscious desire to be like the celebrity – we’re sold the idea that if we drink enough of Dylan’s whiskey, some of his talent will rub off on us. At a deeper level, they make success and fame seem laughably attainable – all you have to do to look like Nicole Scherzinger is buy the product she’s advertising, even if it has a dumb name like “Perfectil.” (One assumes “Definitelygoingtoworkil” was already taken.)Sometimes I worry that all celebrity endorsements do is dilute our own uniqueness. We cobble together an identity based on the things that our favourite celebrities like – a funhouse mirror of different reflections, acting as a substitute for our own personality. Maybe some day the cult of celebrity will die down, and we’ll be able to judge products based on what they are, not who likes them.• Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and performer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056ae0ee464081b2bbc8da519744141f7fd0ade5/0_2_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e570a9d64dd42de5a4e789c6198a382","title":"syria rebuke western inaction military intervention assad","story":"The time for military intervention has passed. But we must still do all we can to make Assad feel the heatThrough a quirk of fate, I was on a bus travelling from Beirut to Damascus on the day that the US, Britain and France launched airstrikes on Syria. The group I joined was on a pastoral visit arranged months earlier, at the invitation of the Syriac Orthodox church, to offer support and solidarity to Syria’s Christians. A circular email had arrived soliciting participants in early March. As my visa application to enter the country, where I have had a home for more than a decade, had been refused in February, it seemed worth trying this route, though my husband and I never\u0026nbspimagined we would succeed. We were accepted on the trip – but the experience was surreal on almost every level.The name of the bus, al-Ma’arri Travel \u0026amp Tourism, was chosen for an 11th-century blind Syrian poet-philosopher, Abu’l ’Ala al-Ma’arri, whose treatise on forgiveness is thought to have influenced Dante’s Divine Comedy. His poems expressed the pessimism of his times, during which political anarchy and social decay were prevalent. He became a vegetarian and adopted a life of seclusion.Our clergy-led coach party was treated like royalty throughout there was no need even to sully our feet with a descent from the bus at the border, which was especially surreal for me, accustomed as I was to queueing for hours. Breezing through the checkpoints, our bus clearly shone with the sanctity of those on board. My previous trip in late 2014, to rescue my Damascus house from war profiteers, had involved packets of cigarettes passed to soldiers and profuse sweating as hands rummaged among my bags.When I bought the crumbling building in Damascus’s old city in 2005, I did so as a private inidual, with no shortcuts or favours. For three years I battled to complete its restoration, fighting labyrinthine bureaucracy, helped only by ordinary Syrians, including an architect and his team of craftsmen, a lawyer and a bank manager. Various friends who lost their homes in the suburbs to bombardment by the regime have lived there since 2012 – up to five families at some points, more after the Ghouta chemical attack in 2013 when the courtyard was full of mattresses. Today, just one extended family lives there at my invitation, in residence since 2015.In the Christian quarter of the city, we were whisked on to a smaller bus that wiggled its way past the Damascus citadel into the pedestrianised square, directly in front of the spiritual heart of the city, the Umayyad mosque. Its magnificent courtyard had been cleared of worshippers in our honour and we were ushered into an audience hall I had never known existed, despite scores of previous visits. Here, the grand mufti – the country’s most senior Muslim authority – Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun, presided over an atmosphere of bonhomie and spoke of the joy of Muslim-Christian relations. Amnesty International notes that the grand mufti’s approval would have been required for between 5,000 and 13,000 executions carried out at Saydnaya prison since 2011.The compulsory hooded robe for females ensured my anonymity in the official photograph, though I was peeved to discover later that the worry beads given to me were half the size of the men’s – the gender pay gap in another form.In Homs, our next stop, we passed countless chilling posters of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, mainly in his dark glasses and military fatigues, the slogan beneath assuring his people he would protect Syria from “the terrorists”. Before the war the Assad look was more tracksuited, on a bicycle taking his son to school, or tenderly planting trees at the roadside.Homs was shockingly empty, acres of devastation, with only the famous Khalid ibn al-Walid mosque hastily restored by the military construction department to be viewed from afar. It is an empty shell for show, like so much else.We were in Aleppo for Syria’s national day on 17\u0026nbspApril and arrived just in time for an elaborate concert put on for the country’s elites inside the citadel. As we walked up the ramp of one of the world’s greatest pieces of military architecture, we looked down over the destroyed souks and mosques, and were issued little Syrian flags to wave and shout “Hurriya” (freedom) followed by “Halab” (Aleppo) when prompted. It seemed like a cruel echo of the earliest peaceful chants for freedom in 2011. Freedom is now on the regime’s terms\u0026nbsponly.Back in Damascus, on 19 April I visited my house and watched helplessly from the roof as fighter jets from Mezzeh airbase flew in broad daylight over central Damascus and dropped cluster bombs on the southern suburbs of al-Hajar\u0026nbspal-Aswad.“Trapped” was the word I heard again and again from my Syrian friends, Muslim and Christian, to describe their predicament. While the world debates the legality of airstrikes, to those on the ground the action amounts to no more than hot air. Not one of my friends even mentioned the strikes, knowing their fate remains unchanged – to be killed if they dare to protest or to submit to the will of Assad. It is far too late for the west and the international community to intervene militarily in Syria – that should have been done in 2011, or 2013 at the latest, before Islamic State or Russia came in to fill the lawless vacuum we ignored.Now the only option is to keep up all forms of pressure\u0026nbspon the Assad regime and on Putin, to make both feel the heat. In the past, Assad has caved in quickly to pressure, such as when he removed his troops from Lebanon in a matter of weeks following the international outrage at the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon, in 2005. Assad and Putin are umbilically connected at present, but if the cord were cut, leaving Assad stripped of his Russian shield, he would capitulate much faster than anyone imagines. All it needs is a united and coherent policy. That’s something that has been sadly lacking so far.• Diana Darke is the author of The Merchant of Syria"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70bfac1fa7a9c5da5a8e47177de448ba47e78131/0_0_1128_677/master/1128.jpg?w=740\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6aae0acecb858aaf7c29a02f5f7245df 740w","title":"how we made outnumbered claire skinner interview","story":"‘Once the kids were done filming, Hugh Dennis and I would do all the reaction shots to broom handles with wigs on’There are many reasons why no TV series before Outnumbered had tried to capture the chaos of life with small kids. Restrictions on working hours aside, children hate things like learning lines, standing still, having strangers fiddling with their hair and being shouted at by men in puffa jackets yelling: “Action!”. Kids on telly always behaved wrongly, too. They tended to be standing in one place and looking directly at the person who was talking to them – whereas in real life, the adult who’s talking to them is the least interesting thing around. While we wanted to create something that was funny, we also wanted it to feel real, so we took the eye contact out and got rid of all things kids don’t like. There was no makeup, we ran the set in an informal way and we tried not to keep them hanging around. Before each scene, we would just give them an outline: “Your dad’s going to come in, he’s going to moan at you, you’re going to tell him to leave you alone.” And the kids would do it in their own words, in a completely authentic way.Getting it commissioned didn’t happen overnight. In the end, we made a 10-minute sample and, when we showed it to people, they finally got it. We recycled a chunk of this, the mother and daughter nit-combing scene, in the first episode. If you look closely, you’ll see that both Claire and Ramona suddenly have completely different hair. Nobody ever noticed.Some people thought we just turned up with cameras and let the kids make it up, but we had a complete, polished script that we worked hard on – we just didn’t show it to them. The improvised scenes were always with no pressure, and written so that if they didn’t work, they could just come straight out. As the years went by, we used improvisation less with the kids. As you grow older, you still have your imagination but you don’t have that same unselfconscious access to it. My own kids were mostly grown up but it didn’t matter. Parenting is fairly universal: my experiences turned out to be the same as Guy’s. And the dilemmas our fictional parents found themselves in were being played out in tens of thousands of homes up and down the country.When Andy and Guy approached me to play the mother, Sue, I was in the thick of parenting myself. My own kids were six and eight. I thought: “Yes, absolutely, I get this completely.”I liked the way both the mum and the dad, played by Hugh Dennis, were a bit slippery at times. There’s one episode that has Sue rifling through another child’s book-bag, trying to see what grades and feedback that kid has got to compare it to her own. Every parent wants to do that! We filmed in a house in Wandsworth, London, that belonged to a real family. Sometimes we’d arrive in the morning and find their kids still in bed. Our own three young stars would do their schoolwork in the house next door and we’d all eat our meals there too. When the team were ready to start filming the children, they would nip through a gap in the garden fence. Once the kids’ working hours were done, Hugh and I would do all the reverse shots to broom handles with wigs on, or Andy and Guy would stick gaffer tape across their chests and mark on a set of eyes where the kids’ eyelines would be. The kids were so young in the early series that they’re pretty much being themselves. Dan was perhaps furthest away from his character, Ben. He’s more thoughtful and very clever – although, like Ben, he was always trying to figure out how things worked. And then he’d break them. Will there be any more? Maybe a one-off or a Christmas special. It would be funny to see what the characters are all up to. It was such a great thing to be involved with and a very happy time. It was mad, scrappy, tiring and funny."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fffd94ad08db6a5b2474284a4d1336d2fc4793a7/0_114_3478_2086/master/3478.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24197263018701f044ce96906da96cd0","title":"how universities swept into hostile environment windrush","story":"The same policies that mistreated the Windrush generation turned universities into state ‘enforcers’The scandal about the mistreatment of the sons and daughters of the Windrush generation brought back to me an incident a couple of years ago that had vaguely troubled me at the time but I had put to the back of my mind.I had been asked to be the external examiner for a PhD by a university I had better not name. The supervisor was a former colleague and friend. The thesis was excellent and on an important topic. It all seemed very straightforward.But then I got a request from the HR department to send a photocopy of my passport, something I had never been asked for before. I was uneasy but complied. A few weeks later I met the vice-chancellor and casually mentioned what I had dismissed as typically over-fussy behaviour by HR.I was taken aback when instead of agreeing or sympathising, she robustly defended the request, saying the university was legally obliged to check anyone it paid was not in the UK illegally. I pointed out that it was difficult to imagine illegal immigrants making a living from the token fees paid to external examiners, and dropped the subject.The revelations about the damage inflicted by the government on people of the Windrush generation have been shocking. But there is another sinister symptom of the “hostile environment” that has far-reaching consequences and has yet to be remedied. The only thing the government has apologised for, under the duress of bad publicity, is that the wrong people – UK citizens or those with permanent residence rights – had been caught up in the net of its relentlessly hostile policy to immigrants. This same policy has turned hospitals, local councils, housing associations, employers, and, of course, colleges and universities, into state enforcers.Now universities are expected to check that anyone they make a payment to, however trivial, has a legal right to be in the UK. This covers not only external examiners but also speakers who receive any kind of fee as well as employees, casual and permanent. This vetting of external speakers is a far greater affront to academic freedom than the stray examples of no-platforming that so appal ministers and the Office for Students.It doesn’t end there. For a long time, some students who have lived in the UK and been educated here have been categorised as international students, and so have to pay high fees, because of question marks about their status.Then there is the government’s anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent, which involves more vetting. External speakers now have to prove not only that they are not “illegals”, but occasionally give an indication of what they are going to say to make sure they are not promoting (ill-defined) extremism.This is not the place to get into a detailed argument about the rights and wrongs of Prevent, although it is worth noting that it would be unconstitutional in the US and that restricting free speech, however extreme, has to be fully justified in a liberal democracy and open society.The real issue is whether it is right to place legal-administrative responsibilities on universities that, in effect, make them state agents. As the Windrush scandal reminds us, organisations err on the side of caution. If in doubt, don’t. So the vettings and restrictions inexorably spread.Maybe we should ponder the fate of the Central European University in Budapest, its very existence endangered by the triumphantly re-elected Orbán government – on a platform with chilling reminders of the anti-immigration agenda pursued less aggressively but just as surely by the\u0026nbspUK government with its Brexit “mandate”.The economist Friedrich Hayek, certainly a favourite among ministers and their supporting cast of ideologues, wrote a book entitled The Road to Serfdom. Universities are advancing down that road, lulled by the supposed limits set by English pragmatism and sense of “fair play”. Under the pretence of protecting the “customer”, they are burdened with ever more state regulation and control, as well as being turned into agents of the state on immigration, anti-radicalisation and the rest.Two final thoughts. How reassured will EU citizens working in our colleges and universities be by the treatment of the Windrush generation? As for me, next time I am asked to send a copy of my passport I will politely decline. To agree would be a betrayal of my rights as a free-born citizen of a country for ever associated with liberty.Peter Scott is professor of higher education studies, UCL Institute of Education"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1564bd74fbcabb80b7fe826960944bad54a68a2e/0_177_1485_891/master/1485.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=862cec014b2ebf79c7d90e7c637d5f81","title":"juup heynckes denies real madrid complex but calls for bayern efficiency","story":"Bayern’s manager says he does not fear the champions but Franz Beckenbauer senses the Spaniards have a mental edgeAt the end of the final session at Bayern Munich’s Säbener Strasse training ground their players took penalties but Jupp Heynckes said it had nothing to do with the prospect of a shootout at the Bernabéu on Tuesday night.Instead, their manager claimed, the explanation was simpler than that: the practice match had finished in a draw. Heynckes said there was no way to recreate the pressure and tension of penalties and dismissed Franz Beckenbauer’s suggestion that Bayern have a “complex” when it comes to Real Madrid but he did appeal for his side to seek “inner peace” as they arrived in Spain looking to reach the Champions League final on 26 May.Bayern were defeated 2-1 in Munich but Heynckes believes the first leg showed Madrid could be “hurt” and welcomed the prospect of the semi‑final being decided from 12 yards. Although he said there would be small changes, he insisted that above all his side needed to be more “efficient” than in the first leg, during which they racked up 18 shots but finished with a sixth successive defeat against their European rivals – a run that includes two in last season’s quarter-finals. Bayern lost 2-1 at home then as well but levelled the aggregate score in Madrid, taking the tie into extra time before being defeated 4-2.“Everyone saw we were defeated by two offside goals,” Thomas Müller said but the club’s honorary president had suggested there might be a different explanation. “There will never be a time when it’s so easy to beat them they weren’t brilliant,” Beckenbauer claimed three days ago. “I fear we have a complex with Madrid.”The other major problem they have is injuries: Jérôme Boateng, Arturo Vidal, Arjen Robben, Kingsley Coman and Manuel Neuer are absent.“Recent losses play no part, because I wasn’t the coach then and tomorrow is a different team from last year,” Heynckes said. “For all of us here, what other people say is irrelevant – even if it is our president. This season we have shown we can be successful in close games and tomorrow will be very difficult for us but I think it will be for Real Madrid, too.“I have a lot of players with experience, internationals who have had success, and we come here to take our chance. We face a team that has been champion two years in a row, three times in four years, and are used to big games, but we never surrender and we want to be in the final. Faith moves mountains. If you want to win the Champions League, you have to have talent, good players, luck in the draw and in certain moments the right referee.“We have to have balance between attack and defence. Even if it sounds comic, we have to find an inner peace, that balance we had in 2013. I think we have a better squad now but in these big games we need leaders, people who step forward. That’s the art of great players.”It was put to Müller that he had never scored against Madrid and that Robert Lewandowski’s failure to score in the first leg had cost Bayern. “If you don’t win, people always look for a scapegoat. If we don’t score, people look at Lewandowski. But he has 28 goals and he is undisputed, a great striker. Ronaldo didn’t score in the first game either,” he said. “I didn’t know I hadn’t scored against Madrid. Maybe that’s extra motivation but personal stats don’t interest me much if the result is good without me scoring, fine. Although it wouldn’t be bad to score.”Zinedine Zidane, meanwhile, vowed that Madrid would attack, not seek to protect the lead, even if Sergio Ramos did claim that the most important factor would be “defensive seriousness” and that the counterattack might be key. Despite the probable absence of Isco and injury to Dani Carvajal, Zidane said: “Bayern are a great team and will go for it. We have to go out there to win, to score as soon as we can, without dropping back at all, without trying to contain the game or doing anything odd.”Asked which opponent he would prevent from playing if he could, Bayern’s former Madrid midfielder James Rodríguez said: “I’d take all 11 out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d557062a207bfbf3765c71526f44992eb0b94828/0_44_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1ae86cb2ac1d9f0188b8510cc06410","title":"tottenham hotspur watford premier league match report","story":"If the result is all that matters at this late stage of the season, then Tottenham will reflect on this low-key victory with a measure of satisfaction. It did not bother Mauricio Pochettino that there were times when his bruised players tried too hard to extinguish their disappointment at failing to reach the FA Cup final. They still won with plenty left in the tank and, in the end, this was a timely reminder that the modern Tottenham possess more resolve than many of their predecessors.That is why Pochettino likes to speak about this young team’s development. The Argentinian has hardened their mentality and, while Tottenham’s wait for their first trophy since 2008 will not end this season, the bottom line is that they can guarantee a top-four finish by beating West Brom on Saturday and Newcastle next Wednesday.Dele Alli’s opener provided them with a springboard to move five points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea and Tottenham will pip Liverpool to third place if they win their final three matches. They endured some awkward moments here and Watford, who are still not arithmetically safe from relegation, felt aggrieved not to have won for the first time since 3 March. Harry Kane’s 38th goal of the season killed off Javi Gracia’s side, though, and left Pochettino praising his team’s response to losing their FA Cup semi-final to Manchester United last weekend.“It is important in the last few games that we win,” Pochettino said. “We were all disappointed. Our fans the same. You felt it. I am so proud of the mentality and commitment they showed.”The game was played in a subdued atmosphere, with plenty of empty seats dotted around the ground, and Spurs were often there for the taking. There was a slight air of edginess about their play and Pochettino frowned at his team’s tentativeness in the final third, especially when Kane spurned a decent shooting opportunity with an awkward piece of control in the 12th minute. Watford sensed an opportunity to exploit that unease, showing inventiveness on the break, and Spurs’ defenders were relieved to see Hugo Lloris deny Andre Gray in the 25th minute.The frustration for Watford, however, was that one defensive aberration had already undermined their enterprising approach by the time Gray saw his snapshot pushed away.A team with Tottenham’s attacking options rarely require a helping hand from their opponents and Orestis Karnezis will wince when he watches a replay of the mistake that handed the home team an undeserved lead.The threat looked minimal when Kieran Trippier whipped a cross towards the near post from the right flank. It should have been a routine catch for Karnezis. Instead, the Watford goalkeeper was distracted by Christian Kabasele ducking underneath the ball and his fumble presented Christian Eriksen with the chance to tee up Alli, who drove a low shot into the unguarded net.However, Pochettino was mistaken if he thought that isolated show of composure from Alli would settle his players. Watford targeted Tottenham’s unconvincing high line, forcing Lloris to race out of his area to beat Abdoulaye Doucouré to a through-ball, and all that was missing was a touch of ruthlessness.A lovely backheel from Will Hughes released Doucouré, who shot straight at Lloris, and Richarlison also had an effort pushed away after combining with Gray. “We conceded a few chances but Lloris showed fantastic skills in goal,” Pochettino said. His side would make Watford regret their generosity. “We conceded cheap goals,” Gracia said. “When we created chances we didn’t score.”Tottenham emerged with renewed focus at the start of the second half and normal service was resumed when Kane made it 2-0. The goal stemmed from one of those flowing moves that have made Spurs so enjoyable to watch under Pochettino, Eriksen shuffling a pass to Alli, who poked the ball through to Son Heung-min on the left. Son wasted no time turning the ball across goal and, although Kane slipped in the middle, the striker sprung back to his feet to meet Trippier’s centre with a crisp shot.Watford, winless on their travels since 25 November, had been put in their place. Richarlison contrived to fire over from close range and Gerard Deulofeu had a goal correctly ruled out for offside.

He did the same last summer after relegation and they released £1.5m, of which Mowbray spent £1.25m, including £750,000 signing Bradley Dack, the midfield craftsman whose performances have been outstanding.Anuradha Desai, the chair of Venky’s known respectfully at the club as “Madam”, and her brothers Balaji and Venkatesh Rao have not been to a Rovers match or even Ewood Park for almost three years, since the dire and difficult fourth season in the Championship in 2015-16.“I will go to India and say in the Championship there are at least 12 clubs with parachute payments, with a minimum wage bill of £40m, some of them £60m,” Mowbray said. “Our wage bill now is £8.5m we have to significantly improve that otherwise we will be struggling. The conversations in the summer will be: what is the ambition, what do they want?”The answer to that question has been a head-scratching mystery, their knowledge of English football in doubt, their plans always apparently sketchy, from the moment they bought the club in 2010. Walker’s Jersey-based millions had rebuilt Ewood on three sides and bought a team to win the 1995 Premier League, but after he died his estate’s trustees funded the club modestly and reluctantly for 10 years. Still, Rovers finished 10th in the Premier League in 2009-10, averaging crowds above 25,000. In six-and-a-half years, Venky’s venture into English football brought two relegations, 10 managers, countless players, sundry advisers, and spending put at £120m.Some involved say the Venky family’s appetite to buy a football club was prompted by their enjoyment of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. They were introduced to the Rovers acquisition by Kentaro, a TV rights and sponsorship company now in administration, who had advised Thaksin Shinawatra, the former Thai prime minister, on his 2007 purchase of Manchester City. The prominent football agent Jerome Anderson, best known for representing Arsenal players over 20 years, advised Thaksin at City, working to bring in players who were mostly good value, including the Brazilian international Elano.What followed has certainly brought Venky’s recognition but as a byword for bewildering decline, rather than an advance on global poultry domination. Supporters are still incredulous at the immediate sacking of Sam Allardyce and the elevation of his first-team coach, Steve Kean, an Anderson client, for his first managerial job. Anderson, advising initially on players, hoped to repeat the quality of signings made at City, but the arrivals of the Argentinian Mauro Formica from Newell’s Old Boys and Rubén Rochina from Barcelona’s youth system were not sufficient ballast for a club plunged into turmoil. Senior players spoke out in bemusement and soon the long-serving chairman John Williams and other directors departed, having complained to Desai that an established transfer policy had been abandoned.Kean’s team did beat Liverpool 3-1 in January 2011 and finished 15th but in 2011-12, despite beating Manchester United 3-2 at Old Trafford, Rovers’ 11-year tenure in the Premier League ended in a bitterly rancorous relegation.Kean was backed to sign nine players in the summer of 2012 including the £8m striker Jordan Rhodes, but there were tensions with Shebby Singh, an Asian football TV pundit whom Venky’s appointed as “global football adviser” and Kean resigned at the end of September with Rovers third in the Championship. They went through two more managers that season, Henning Berg and Michael Appleton, and finished 17th, Gary Bowyer made steady progress but was sacked after a difficult start to the 2015-16 season Paul Lambert kept Rovers up that season but activated his own release clause as new finance director, Mike Cheston, warned that spending had to be reined in because Premier League parachute payments had finally been lost. Owen Coyle, formerly manager at nearest rivals Burnley, did not cheer the Ewood Park stands and left last February with the team second bottom in the Championship Mowbray could not effect a rescue last season and Rovers dropped into League One.Yet throughout, the Venky family have continued to fund the club and fend off financial collapse, loaning £95m in total, as the club lost £36.5m in 2012-13, £42m the following season and £17m in 2014‑15. Home crowds have halved 11,679 watched the Peterborough victory, the hardboiled core in the Blackburn End stubbornly chanting “barmy army”. Mowbray spoke of needing to rebuild supporters’ enthusiasm and trust, and hoping to prompt more engagement from the owners when he travels to Pune. “I haven’t seen them for a year I speak on the phone every now and then,” he said. “I met them last summer they are nice, humble people I think they have been poorly advised and the club has been managed poorly. I’m just trying to bring some honesty, integrity and hard work. I think financially they can do it.“But they have been burned so much, maybe they need to get a bit of love and enjoyment back in football, and hopefully this year might reinvigorate that.”Perhaps it will as with much of Venky’s approach in the calamitous years since they decided to buy long‑established Blackburn Rovers, it is all a bit of a puzzle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f4b9ec8f473c1c82d0e3effd7711d2870bc995/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1272a646421a9427484e68e5199538ed","title":"seven ways to support your immune system","story":"Your body works hard to fight off infections, but there are things you can do to give it a boostMost people know about the benefits of exercise for our hearts, waistlines, muscles and bones. Fewer are aware of how it supports our immune defences, especially as we age. Production of naive T cells, which raise the alarm when they detect infections the immune system has not encountered before, declines as we get older. Research published by Professor Janet Lord’s group at the University of Birmingham last month found that cyclists aged 55 to 79 were generating as many of these cells as young adults and had more B regulatory cells, which help to prevent autoimmune disease. Other studies show moderate to vigorous exercise reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold.Sleep is important to the functioning of the immune system. Research suggests that white blood cells in those aged 65 and over who sleep six hours or fewer a night may be less effective in dealing with invading pathogens than cells from those who sleep more. Sleep deprivation also makes people more susceptible to colds and flu.Our guts contain trillions of microbes that play key roles in the immune system. For example, they promote the production of T cells, which help to trigger immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Having a low-fat, high-fibre diet with plenty of vegetables promotes a broad range of gut bugs and boost levels of beneficial bacteria. “Having a varied diet is likely to be better for your bacteria, which is, in turn, likely to be better for your immune function,” says Professor Sheena Cruickshank of the University of Manchester.Probiotics – live bacteria or yeasts added to yoghurts or taken as supplements – can reduce the risk of infectious diarrhoea linked to antibiotic use and help those with ulcerative colitis or pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. However, most of the claims made for probiotics are not supported by good-quality research evidence, despite a global market estimated to be worth about $40bn (£29bn). Prebiotics – non-digestible food ingredients that help existing gut probiotics grow – are also available. There are studies that suggest benefits, but most are small-scale and industry-funded. “It’s a huge business, but at this stage it’s not clear which bacteria we might want to nurture to promote health-giving effects, and most people could probably get the same effects with a healthy, balanced diet,” says Cruickshank.Drinking to excess can leave you with more than a hangover. A 2014 study found that drinking four to five shots of vodka reduced levels of white blood cells, which combat infections and cancer, for up to five hours after peak intoxication. Heavy drinking has also been found to undermine the ability of immune cells called macrophages to engulf bacteria.Smokers are more prone to inflammatory diseases and infections such as pneumonia and flu than non-smokers. Research suggests this may be partly down to nicotine undermining the ability of white blood cells called neutrophils to ingest and kill harmful microbes. Smokers also have fewer friendly bacteria and more pathogens in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and higher levels of bacteria that cause skin infections and oral diseases.Our bodies create vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight outdoors. Vitamin D helps to keep our finely tuned immune systems in balance by, for example, stimulating the development of cells that prevent the autoimmune responses seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used by macrophages to help kill harmful bacteria, and supports our defences against colds and flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee6889e6ad11c9b7dfcc21f27fa3dc66b7d3e56/0_1477_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb33f1cd0a1c78a09a848fa596f1e2ea","title":"nigel slater pearl barley bacon and taleggio recipe","story":"An easy pancetta, cheese and chewy grains recipe for a quick, delicious supperBoil 200g of pearl barley in deep, lightly salted water for 25 minutes until tender.Whilst the pearl barley is cooking, cut 250g of smoked pancetta into 2cm cubes and cook in a couple of glugs of olive oil in a shallow pan until lightly crisp on all sides.

Much of the time it is living on past glories. This sorry state of affairs reflects what we have become. But current democracy is not who we are. It is just a system of government, which we built, and which we could replace. So why don’t we replace it with something better?This line of argument has grown louder in recent years, as democratic politics has become more unpredictable and, to many, deeply alarming in its outcomes. First Brexit, then Donald Trump, plus the rise of populism and the spread of ision, has started a tentative search for plausible alternatives. But the rival systems we see around us have a very limited appeal. The unlovely forms of 21st-century authoritarianism can at best provide only a partial, pragmatic alternative to democracy. The world’s strongmen still pander to public opinion, and in the case of competitive authoritarian regimes such as the ones in Hungary and Turkey, they persist with the rigmarole of elections. From Trump to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is not much of a leap into a brighter future.There is a far more dogmatic alternative, which has its roots in the 19th century. Why not ditch the charade of voting altogether? Stop pretending to respect the views of ordinary people – it’s not worth it, since the people keep getting it wrong. Respect the experts instead! This is the truly radical option. So should we try it?The name for this view of politics is epistocracy: the rule of the knowers. It is directly opposed to democracy, because it argues that the right to participate in political decision-making depends on whether or not you know what you are doing. The basic premise of democracy has always been that it doesn’t matter how much you know: you get a say because you have to live with the consequences of what you do. In ancient Athens, this principle was reflected in the practice of choosing office-holders by lottery. Anyone could do it because everyone – well, everyone who wasn’t a woman, a foreigner, a pauper, a slave or a child – counted as a member of the state. With the exception of jury service in some countries, we don’t choose people at random for important roles any more. But we do uphold the underlying idea by letting citizens vote without checking their suitability for the task.Critics of democracy – starting with Plato – have always argued that it means rule by the ignorant, or worse, rule by the charlatans that the ignorant people fall for. Living in Cambridge, a passionately pro-European town and home to an elite university, I heard echoes of that argument in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. It was usually uttered sotto voce – you have to be a brave person to come out as an epistocrat in a democratic society – but it was unquestionably there. Behind their hands, very intelligent people muttered to each other that this is what you get if you ask a question that ordinary people don’t understand. Dominic Cummings, the author of the “Take Back Control” slogan that helped win the referendum, found that his critics were not so shy about spelling it out to his face. Brexit happened, they told him, because the wicked people lied to the stupid people. So much for democracy.To say that democrats want to be ruled by the stupid and the ignorant is unfair. No defender of democracy has ever claimed that stupidity or ignorance are virtues in themselves. But it is true that democracy doesn’t discriminate on the grounds of a lack of knowledge. It considers the ability to think intelligently about difficult questions a secondary consideration. The primary consideration is whether an inidual is implicated in the outcome. Democracy asks only that the voters should be around long enough to suffer for their own mistakes.The question that epistocracy poses is: why don’t we discriminate on the basis of knowledge? What’s so special about letting everyone take part? Behind it lies the intuitively appealing thought that, instead of living with our mistakes, we should do everything in our power to prevent them in the first place – then it wouldn’t matter who has to take responsibility.This argument has been around for more than 2,000 years. For most of that time, it has been taken very seriously. The consensus until the end of the 19th century was that democracy is usually a bad idea: it is just too risky to put power in the hands of people who don’t know what they are doing. Of course, that was only the consensus among intellectuals. We have little way of knowing what ordinary people thought about the question. Nobody was asking them.Over the course of the 20th century, the intellectual consensus was turned around. Democracy established itself as the default condition of politics, its virtues far outweighing its weaknesses. Now the events of the 21st century have revived some of the original doubts. Democracies do seem to be doing some fairly stupid things at present. Perhaps no one will be able to live with their mistakes. In the age of Trump, climate change and nuclear weapons, epistocracy has teeth again.So why don’t we give more weight to the views of the people who are best qualified to evaluate what to do? Before answering that question, it is important to distinguish between epistocracy and something with which it is often confused: technocracy. They are different. Epistocracy means rule by the people who know best. Technocracy is rule by mechanics and engineers. A technocrat is someone who understands how the machinery works.In November 2011, Greek democracy was suspended and an elected government was replaced by a cabinet of experts, tasked with stabilising the collapsing Greek economy before new elections could be held. This was an experiment in technocracy, however, not epistocracy. The engineers in this case were economists. Even highly qualified economists often haven’t a clue what’s best to do. What they know is how to operate a complex system that they have been instrumental in building – so long as it behaves the way it is meant to. Technocrats are the people who understand what’s best for the machine. But keeping the machine running might be the worst thing we could do. Technocrats won’t help with that question.Both representative democracy and pragmatic authoritarianism have plenty of space for technocracy. Increasingly, each system has put decision-making capacity in the hands of specially trained experts, particularly when it comes to economic questions. Central bankers wield significant power in a wide variety of political systems around the world. For that reason, technocracy is not really an alternative to democracy. Like populism, it is more of an add-on. What makes epistocracy different is that it prioritises the “right” decision over the technically correct decision. It tries to work out where we should be going. A technocrat can only tell us how we should get there.How would epistocracy function in practice? The obvious difficulty is knowing who should count as the knowers. There is no formal qualification for being a general expert. It is much easier to identify a suitable technocrat. Technocracy is more like plumbing than philosophy. When Greece went looking for economic experts to sort out its financial mess, it headed to Goldman Sachs and the other big banks, since that is where the technicians were congregated. When a machine goes wrong, the people responsible for fixing it often have their fingerprints all over it already.Historically, some epistocrats have tackled the problem of identifying who knows best by advocating non-technical qualifications for politics. If there were such a thing as the university of life, that’s where these epistocrats would want political decision-makers to get their higher degrees. But since there is no such university, they often have to make do with cruder tests of competence. The 19th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill argued for a voting system that granted varying numbers of votes to different classes of people depending on what jobs they did. Professionals and other highly educated iniduals would get six or more votes each farmers and traders would get three or four skilled labourers would get two unskilled labourers would get one. Mill also pushed hard for women to get the vote, at a time when that was a deeply unfashionable view. He did not do this because he thought women were the equals of men. It was because he thought some women, especially the better educated, were superior to most men. Mill was a big fan of discrimination, so long as it was on the right grounds.To 21st-century eyes, Mill’s system looks grossly undemocratic. Why should a lawyer get more votes than a labourer? Mill’s answer would be to turn the question on its head: why should a labourer get the same number of votes as a lawyer? Mill was no simple democrat, but he was no technocrat either. Lawyers didn’t qualify for their extra votes because politics placed a special premium on legal expertise. No, lawyers got their extra votes because what’s needed are people who have shown an aptitude for thinking about questions with no easy answers. Mill was trying to stack the system to ensure as many different points of view as possible were represented. A government made up exclusively of economists or legal experts would have horrified him. The labourer still gets a vote. Skilled labourers get two. But even though a task like bricklaying is a skill, it is a narrow one. What was needed was breadth. Mill believed that some points of view carried more weight simply because they had been exposed to more complexity along the way.Jason Brennan, a very 21st-century philosopher, has tried to revive the epistocratic conception of politics, drawing on thinkers like Mill. In his 2016 book Against Democracy, Brennan insists that many political questions are simply too complex for most voters to comprehend. Worse, the voters are ignorant about how little they know: they lack the ability to judge complexity because they are so attached to simplistic solutions that feel right to them.Brennan writes: “Suppose the United States had a referendum on whether to allow significantly more immigrants into the country. Knowing whether this is a good idea requires tremendous social scientific knowledge. One needs to know how immigration tends to affect crime rates, domestic wages, immigrants’ welfare, economic growth, tax revenues, welfare expenditures and the like. Most Americans lack this knowledge in fact, our evidence is that they are systematically mistaken.”In other words, it’s not just that they don’t know it’s not even that they don’t know that they don’t know it’s that they are wrong in ways that reflect their unwavering belief that they are right.Brennan doesn’t have Mill’s faith that we can tell how well-equipped someone is to tackle a complex question by how difficult that person’s job is. There is too much chance and social conditioning involved. He would prefer an actual exam, to “screen out citizens who are badly misinformed or ignorant about the election, or who lack basic social scientific knowledge”. Of course, this just pushes the fundamental problem back a stage without resolving it: who gets to set the exam? Brennan teaches at a university, so he has little faith in the disinterested qualities of most social scientists, who have their own ideologies and incentives. He has also seen students cramming for exams, which can produce its own biases and blind spots. Still, he thinks Mill was right to suggest that the further one advances up the educational ladder, the more votes one should get: five extra votes for finishing high school, another five for a bachelor’s degree, and five more for a graduate degree.Brennan is under no illusions about how provocative this case is today, 150 years after Mill made it. In the middle of the 19th century, the idea that political status should track social and educational standing was barely contentious today, it is barely credible. Brennan also has to face the fact that contemporary social science provides plenty of evidence that the educated are just as subject to groupthink as other people, sometimes even more so. The political scientists Larry Bartels and Christopher Achen point this out in their 2016 book Democracy for Realists: “The historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone wrong in their moral and political thinking as often as everyone else.” Cognitive biases are no respecters of academic qualifications. How many social science graduates would judge the question about immigration according to the demanding tests that Brennan lays out, rather than according to what they would prefer to believe? The irony is that if Brennan’s voter exam were to ask whether the better-educated deserve more votes, the technically correct answer might be no. It would depend on who was marking it.However, in one respect Brennan insists that the case for epistocracy has grown far stronger since Mill made it. That is because Mill was writing at the dawn of democracy. Mill published his arguments in the run-up to what became the Second Reform Act of 1867, which doubled the size of the franchise in Britain to nearly 2.5 million voters (out of a general population of 30 million). Mill’s case for epistocracy was based on his conviction that over time it would merge into democracy. The labourer who gets one vote today would get more tomorrow, once he had learned how to use his vote wisely. Mill was a great believer in the educative power of democratic participation.Brennan thinks we now have 100-plus years of evidence that Mill was wrong. Voting is bad for us. It doesn’t make people better informed. If anything, it makes them stupider, because it dignifies their prejudices and ignorance in the name of democracy. “Political participation is not valuable for most people,” Brennan writes. “On the contrary, it does most of us little good and instead tends to stultify and corrupt us. It turns us into civic enemies who have grounds to hate one another.” The trouble with democracy is that it gives us no reason to become better informed. It tells us we are fine as we are. And we’re not.In the end, Brennan’s argument is more historical than philosophical. If we were unaware of how democracy would turn out, it might make sense to cross our fingers and assume the best of it. But he insists that we do know, and so we have no excuse to keep kidding ourselves. Brennan thinks that we should regard epistocrats like himself as being in the same position as democrats were in the mid-19th century. What he is championing is anathema to many people, as democracy was back then. Still, we took a chance on democracy, waiting to see how it would turn out. Why shouldn’t we take a chance on epistocracy, now we know how the other experiment went? Why do we assume that democracy is the only experiment we are ever allowed to run, even after it has run out of steam?It’s a serious question, and it gets to how the longevity of democracy has stifled our ability to think about the possibility of something different. What was once a seemingly reckless form of politics has become a byword for caution. And yet there are still good reasons to be cautious about ditching it. Epistocracy remains the reckless idea. There are two dangers in particular.The first is that we set the bar too high in politics by insisting on looking for the best thing to do. Sometimes it is more important to avoid the worst. Even if democracy is often bad at coming up with the right answers, it is good at unpicking the wrong ones. Moreover, it is good at exposing people who think they always know best. Democratic politics assumes there is no settled answer to any question and it ensures that is the case by allowing everyone a vote, including the ignorant. The randomness of democracy – which remains its essential quality – protects us against getting stuck with truly bad ideas. It means that nothing will last for long, because something else will come along to disrupt it.Epistocracy is flawed because of the second part of the word rather than the first – this is about power (kratos) as much as it is about knowledge (episteme). Fixing power to knowledge risks creating a monster that can’t be deflected from its course, even when it goes wrong – which it will, since no one and nothing is infallible. Not knowing the right answer is a great defence against people who believe that their knowledge makes them superior.Brennan’s response to this argument (a version of which is made by David Estlund in his 2007 book Democratic Authority) is to turn it on its head. Since democracy is a form of kratos, too, he says, why aren’t we concerned about protecting iniduals from the incompetence of the demos just as much as from the arrogance of the epistocrats? But these are not the same kinds of power. Ignorance and foolishness don’t oppress in the same way that knowledge and wisdom do, precisely because they are incompetent: the demos keeps changing its mind.The democratic case against epistocracy is a version of the democratic case against pragmatic authoritarianism. You have to ask yourself where you’d rather be when things go wrong. Maybe things will go wrong quicker and more often in a democracy, but that is a different issue. Rather than thinking of democracy as the least worst form of politics, we could think of it as the best when at its worst. It is the difference between Winston Churchill’s famous dictum and a similar one from Alexis de Tocqueville a hundred years earlier that is less well-known but more apposite. More fires get started in a democracy, de Tocqueville said, but more fires get put out, too.The recklessness of epistocracy is also a function of the historical record that Brennan uses to defend it. A century or more of democracy may have uncovered its failings, but they have also taught us that we can live with them. We are used to the mess and attached to the benefits. Being an epistocrat like Mill before democracy had got going is very different from being one now that democracy is well established. We now know what we know, not just about democracy’s failings, but about our tolerance for its incompetences.The great German sociologist Max Weber, writing at the turn of the 20th century, took it for granted that universal suffrage was a dangerous idea, because of the way that it empowered the mindless masses. But he argued that once it had been granted, no sane politician should ever think about taking it away: the backlash would be too terrible. The only thing worse than letting everyone vote is telling some people that they no longer qualify. Never mind who sets the exam, who is going to tell us that we’ve failed? Mill was right: democracy comes after epistocracy, not before. You can’t run the experiment in reverse.The cognitive biases that epistocracy is meant to rescue us from are what will ultimately scupper it. Loss aversion makes it more painful to be deprived of something we have that doesn’t always work than something we don’t have that might. It’s like the old joke. Q: “Do you know the way to Dublin?” A: “Well, I wouldn’t start from here.” How do we get to a better politics? Well, maybe we shouldn’t start from here. But here is where we are.Still, there must be other ways of trying to inject more wisdom into democratic politics than an exam. This is the 21st century: we have new tools to work with. If many of the problems with democracy derive from the business of politicians hawking for votes at election time, which feeds noise and bile into the decision-making process, perhaps we should try to simulate what people would choose under more sedate and reflective conditions. For instance, it may be possible to extrapolate from what is known about voters’ interests and preferences what they ought to want if they were better able to access the knowledge they needed. We could run mock elections that replicate the input from different points of view, as happens in real elections, but which strip out all the distractions and distortions of democracy in action.Brennan suggests the following: “We can administer surveys that track citizens’ political preferences and demographic characteristics, while testing their basic objective political knowledge. Once we have this information, we can simulate what would happen if the electorate’s demographics remained unchanged, but all citizens were able to get perfect scores on tests of objective political knowledge. We can determine, with a strong degree of confidence, what ‘We the People’ would want, if only ‘We the People’ understood what we were talking about.”Democratic dignity – the idea that all citizens should be allowed to express their views and have them taken seriously by politicians – goes out the window under such a system. We are each reduced to data points in a machine-learning exercise. But, according to Brennan, the outcomes should improve.In 2017, a US-based digital technology company called Kimera Systems announced that it was close to developing an AI named Nigel, whose job was to help voters know how they should vote in an election, based on what it already knew of their personal preferences. Its creator, Mounir Shita, declared: “Nigel tries to figure out your goals and what reality looks like to you and is constantly assimilating paths to the future to reach your goals. It’s constantly trying to push you in the right direction.”This is the more personalised version of what Brennan\u0026nbspis proposing, with some of the democratic dignity plugged back in. Nigel is not trying to work out what’s best for everyone, only what’s best for you. It accepts your version of reality. Yet Nigel understands that you are incapable of drawing the correct political inferences from your preferences. You need help, from a\u0026nbspmachine that has seen enough of your personal behaviour to understand what it is you are after. Siri recommends books you might like. Nigel recommends political parties and policy positions.Would this be so bad? To many people it instinctively sounds like a parody of democracy because it treats us like confused children. But to Shita it is an enhancement of democracy because it takes our desires seriously. Democratic politicians don’t much care what it is that\u0026nbspwe actually want. They care what it is they can persuade us we want, so they can better appeal to it. Nigel puts the voter first. At the same time, by protecting us from our own confusion and inattention, Nigel strives to improve our self-understanding. Brennan’s version effectively gives up on Mill’s original\u0026nbspidea that voting might be an educative experience. Shita hasn’t given up. Nigel is trying to nudge us along the path to self-knowledge. We\u0026nbspmight end up learning who we really are.The fatal flaw with this approach, however, is that we risk learning only who it is we think we are, or who it is we would like to be. Worse, it is who we would like to be now, not who or what we might become in the future. Like focus groups, Nigel provides a snapshot of a set of\u0026nbspattitudes at a moment in time. The danger of any system\u0026nbspof machine learning is that it produces feedback\u0026nbsploops. By restricting the dataset to our past behaviour, Nigel teaches us nothing about what other people think, or even about other ways of seeing the world. Nigel simply mines the archive of our attitudes for the most consistent expression of our identities. If we lean left, we will end up leaning further left. If we lean right, we will end up leaning further right. Social and political ision would widen. Nigel is designed to\u0026nbspclose the circle in our minds.There are technical fixes for feedback loops. Systems can be adjusted to inject alternative points of view, to notice when data is becoming self-reinforcing or simply to randomise the evidence. We can shake things up to lessen the risk that we get set in our ways. For instance, Nigel could make sure that we visit websites that challenge rather than reinforce our preferences. Alternatively, on Brennan’s model, the aggregation of\u0026nbspour preferences could seek to take account of the likelihood that Nigel had exaggerated rather than tempered who we really are. A Nigel of Nigels – a machine that helps other machines to better align their\u0026nbspown goals – could try to strip out the distortions from the artificial democracy we have built. After all, Nigel is our servant, not our master. We can always tell him what to do.But that is the other fundamental problem with 21st-century epistocracy: we won’t be the ones telling Nigel what to do. It will be the technicians who have built the system. They are the experts we rely on to rescue us from feedback loops. For this reason, it is hard\u0026nbspto see how 21st-century epistocracy can avoid collapsing back into technocracy. When things go wrong, the knowers will be powerless to correct for them. Only the engineers who built the machines have\u0026nbspthat capacity, which means that it will be the engineers who have the power.In recent weeks, we have been given a glimpse of\u0026nbspwhat rule by engineers might look like. It is not an authoritarian nightmare of oppression and violence. It is a picture of confusion and obfuscation. The power of engineers never fully comes out into the open, because most people don’t understand what it is they do. The sight of Mark Zuckerberg, perched on his cushion, batting off the ignorant questions of the people’s representatives in Congress is a glimpse of a technocratic future in which democracy meets its\u0026nbspmatch. But this is not a radical alternative to democratic politics. It is simply a distortion of it.Adapted from How Democracy Ends by David Runciman, which will be published by Profile on 10 May.

The cross-party amendment was supported by 19 Tory rebels, winning by a majority of 91.Ministers have previously warned that should parliament vote down the deal agreed by negotiators, Britain would leave the bloc with no agreement. The amendment, led by former Tory minister Douglas Hogg, would change that scenario, meaning parliament could alter it and ask the government to reopen EU talks. The measure is designed to enhance Conservative MP Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, guaranteeing MPs a vote on the final deal, which won a shock victory in the Commons in December.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the vote “a hugely significant moment in the fight to ensure parliament has a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and that we avoid a no-deal situation”.The leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the amendment “puts parliament in the driving seat”.Rebel Tory sources have said they hope to attract cross-party support in the Commons for the plan, giving remainers the confidence to vote against a damaging Brexit deal without the fear that it will trigger a “no deal” outcome where the consequences would be worse.During the debate, Hogg told peers the clause was “designed to ensure that the future of our country is determined by parliament and not by ministers”.He said a choice between accepting the terms or crashing out of the EU would not be a genuine choice. “This is not regaining control. To act in such a manner would be to impose ministerial decisions on parliament by coercion,” he said, calling it “an elective dictatorship of a particularly flagrant kind”.Echoing Margaret Thatcher, under whom he said he was “privileged to serve”, Hogg said his response was: “No, no no!”He called the referendum vote “at the very best an interim decision” and said the public could not have predicted the terms of the UK’s departure.Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts said he was deeply concerned about the sweeping powers of the government, likening it to the 1933 Enabling Act conferring absolute power on Adolf Hitler. “Perhaps I’m seeing threats that do not exist, but they are there, they are possible,” he said. Later in the debate, the Brexit-backing Green party peer Jenny Jones said she had come to the House of Lords prepared to vote for the amendment on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty, but said she had been put off by the speeches of pro-remain peers.“Quite honestly, the speeches in favour have turned me against them,” she said. “There is clearly more of an agenda than control of the process.”Speaking after the vote, Lord Callanan, a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, said the amendment would “weaken the UK’s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely”.The government also lost a vote on a cross-party amendment led by Labour peer John Monks, which would give parliament even greater powers over the Brexit negotiations, though Lords sources played down the significance of the victory. Peers voted to back the amendment by 270 to 233.The amendment calls on ministers to seek parliamentary approval for their phase two negotiating mandate – similar to the process that exists at the EU level, where leaders of the EU27 approve the mandate of Michel Barnier’s negotiating team.Brexiters have said it fundamentally undermines the government. Writing for the Sun, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said: “Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical – because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.“Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give parliament the power to micromanage the government on how to carry out these negotiations.”Davis said the change would give the EU commission “a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50bf890d25ebe73a127570c8fba29b4fe839e77b/0_0_5146_3089/master/5146.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64677920bbba6bbca6fc9489bcddcfb5","title":"sajid javid tory power stance","story":"On his first day at work, the new home secretary resurrected the tradition of Conservative ministers striking a distinctly odd poseAs he was officially unveiled on his first day at work as home secretary, Sajid Javid struck one familiar chord. Or rather, struck one familiar pose – the rather curious, legs-too-far-apart “power stance”.It has become a habit from leading Conservative politicians, dating back to 2015. George Osborne was the early adopter, photographed here after delivering his speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester that year.The spread soon spread. Future prime minister Theresa May took her turn following her speech at the same conference. And then Michael Gove was spotted by  writer Michael Deacon, appearing backstage interviewed by the BBC, in the very same pose.A few months later, then prime minister David Cameron was also doing it – on live TV – for his doomed TV debate attempts to get the country to vote remain in the 2016 referendum.But where does it come from?Back in 2015 the  asked Dr Connson Locke, a leadership and organisational behaviour lecturer at LSE. After she stopped laughing at Osborne’s picture, she told Homa Khaleeli: “All I can think is that he got the advice that you should take up space to demonstrate confidence and he’s taken that to a weird extreme … It doesn’t mean standing with your feet so out of place that you look unnatural.”One possible source is Amy Cuddy. She did a very popular TEDTalk in 2012 that suggested that people adopting “high-power poses” for a couple of minutes a day lead to a measurable difference in how confidently they felt and acted. One of the poses she claimed had this effect is a Lynda Carter Wonder Woman-style pose, very similar to the one that the Tories keep making.Others suggested the influence might be from a beloved TV programme closer to home.With the political demise of Cameron and Osborne in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, and May’s determination to put the remain-backing Conservative years behind the party, we thought the Tory power stance had disappeared.Could Javid’s resurrection of the pose be a coded message to backbench remainers?Meanwhile, with the news breaking late on Sunday night that Amber Rudd had resigned following the Windrush revelations, Labour MP David Lammy had a very different power stance in mind on his way to work on Monday morning.A vocal critic of both the prime minister and the ousted home secretary, Lammy used Twitter to suggest he’d entered the Houses of Parliament today with more than a little swagger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d16e1ba6b834ecadc07c18f4941923c889869af/0_89_3449_2069/master/3449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=934733a6ee3fa133f0095074a9514184","title":"tories flounder in attempt to launch operation save theresa","story":"Amber Rudd made one teeny-weeny little mistake. The mistake of trying to protect her bossWith Operation Save Amber finally derailed after two weeks of fire-fighting the former home secretary’s failing memory – by the weekend she couldn’t even remember what targets she was meant to have forgotten – the Tory party’s attention turned to Operation Save Face. Aka Operation Save Theresa. With Amber Rudd out of a job, the prime minister has been left with no one else to take the blame for her hostile environment policy that caused the Windrush scandal.First out of the blocks on Radio 4’s Today programme was the former cabinet minister Damian Green, a zen master of never saying anything interesting. It took a while for Green to even admit that Rudd had been forced to resign and even then he restricted himself to a laconic: “She had to go.” Which made one wonder why he and so many other Conservatives had spent the previous week saying she had to stay.Next on the airwaves was Chris Grayling, which showed how much of a panic the government was in. The transport secretary is just about the only minister who makes David Davis look quick-witted and is the last person who should be sent out in a crisis.Sure enough, Grayling self-destructed in 10 seconds. After demonstrating he had no grasp of the situation by insisting a fourth cabinet resignation within six months was merely “unwanted noise”, he went on to say that May wouldn’t have known about the targets letter Rudd had sent her in 2017. After all, if the home secretary couldn’t remember writing the letter, then why on earth should the prime minister be expected to recall having read it? Over in Downing Street, May let out a shriek as Grayling inadvertently tried to get her the sack as well. The transport secretary pressed on. What it came down to was this: no one was really to blame for the Windrush debacle and Rudd was every bit as much a victim as the many thousands who had found themselves deprived of work and healthcare and threatened with deportation.More so, in fact. It had been a real advantage to have someone in charge of the Home Office who didn’t know what she was doing and it was a tragedy that she had resigned. Rudd’s tragedy was that she was just too good for this world. She had just made one teeny-weeny little mistake. The mistake of trying to protect her boss.Shortly after appointing Sajid Javid as her new home secretary, it was May’s turn to face the cameras. She looked and sounded terrible, as if she was featuring in a hostage video. Yes there had been targets when she had been home secretary, she mumbled, her eyes numb with terror. It was near enough a confession that she knew Rudd had misled parliament but hadn’t thought it important enough to mention to anyone. Amber could be very proud of her time as home secretary, she added. It’s not everyone who gets to preside over one of the department’s biggest failures in its history.Having posed with his legs thrust astride outside his new office – the department had needed a bit of manspreading to shake it up – Javid soon found himself inside the Commons to face his first urgent question as home secretary. Understandably, he chose to keep his opening remarks short and sweet. He was Windrush. Kiss the badge. Nobody cared about Windrush more than him and he would do whatever was necessary to put things right.Labour’s Diane Abbott wasn’t convinced. She had heard much the same from the last home secretary and what was required was actions not words. Would he reverse the 2014 immigration act and commit to making sure that no other Commonwealth citizens were treated in the same way?“She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger,” Javid snapped indignantly, before going on to show that he still hadn’t fully understood the nature of the problem by failing to acknowledge it had been the prime minister’s hostile environment policies that had resulted in British citizens being threatened with deportation.Several Labour MPs tried to put him right, but Javid wasn’t having any of it. He refused to recognise the term hostile environment. “It’s a compliant environment,” he protested. Compliant as in being as beastly as possible to anyone who looked foreign without being actively hostile. Words matter.Tory Nick Boles invited the new home secretary to distance himself from legacy policies that were fundamentally wrong. Sajid declined. He’d only just got the promotion and was not about to do anything that might get him sacked on the first day. He knew where his priorities lay. His job was to appear to be different. Not be different.

The cross-party amendment, supported by 19 Conservative rebels, won by a majority of 91. Fox said on Tuesday: “I think there’s a very big debate now about whether the unelected house can actually thwart the view of the British electorate in a referendum and … legislation coming from the House of Commons.”He conceded the parliamentary arithmetic was difficult in a hung parliament. “We don’t have a parliamentary majority and that makes life harder, but there are of course quite a number of Labour MPs who represent seats where there is a very heavy vote in favour of leaving … who I think are rash, to say the least, if they try to confront the democratic view of the British people,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Peers also voted for an amendment that would require parliamentary approval for the Brexit negotiating mandate in phase two of the talks – similar to the process where EU27 leaders approve the mandate of their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The third defeat was led by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, who won backing for his amendment which would ensure child asylum seekers would be allowed to join family members in the UK after Brexit.A Liberal Democrat attempt to amend the bill to give voters a referendum on the final deal did not pass, although one Labour frontbench peer, Philip Hunt, ignored party orders to abstain and voted in favour. Labour sources said he would hauled before Labour’s leader in the Lords and chief whip, but the Conservatives called for him to be sacked.The Brexit minister Steve Baker said: “If Labour want to be taken seriously as a party which respects the decision the people took in the referendum, they must remove Lord Hunt from their frontbench.“All their behaviour to this date has shown a determination to disrupt a successful Brexit, but failure to act now would demonstrate a contempt for those who voted for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/648938af7dd57dd8a4374edf13b0ab91b65ee3c6/0_137_4094_2456/master/4094.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de04a5338b8a6263b53a46ff29318eb7","title":"the five habits that can add more than a decade to your life","story":"Major study calculates effect on life of habits including healthy eating and not smokingPeople who stick to five healthy habits in adulthood can add more than a decade to their lives, according to a major study into the impact behaviour has on life.Researchers at Harvard University used lifestyle questionnaires and medical records from 123,000 volunteers to understand how much longer people lived if they followed a healthy diet, controlled their weight, took regular exercise, drank in moderation and did not smoke.When the scientists calculated average life expectancy, they noticed a dramatic effect from the healthy habits. Compared with people who adopted none of them, men and women who adhered to all five saw their life expectancy at 50 rise from 26 to 38 years and 29 to 43 years respectively, or an extra 12 years for men and 14 for women.“When we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer. But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was,” said Meir Stampfer, a co-author on the study and professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.The researchers performed the analysis in the hope of understanding why the US, which spends more on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than any other nation, ranks 31st in the world for life expectancy at birth. According to the World Health Organization, life expectancy at birth in 2015 was 76.9 and 81.6 years old for US men and women respectively. The equivalent figures for Britain are very similar at 79.4 and 83 years old.The five healthy habits were defined as not smoking having a body mass index between 18.5 and 25 taking at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, having no more than one 150ml glass of wine a day for women, or two for men and having a diet rich in items such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains and low in red meat, saturated fats and sugar.Given that the habits of a healthy lifestyle are well known, the mystery is why we are so bad at adopting them, said Stampfer. Part of the problem is that many people struggle to give up smoking, and the continuous peddling of unhealthy food, as well as poor urban planning, which can make it hard for people to exercise, also feed in, he said.“I do think people need to step up and take some personal responsibility, but as a society we need to make it easier for people to do that,” he said. “People can get stuck in a rut and think it’s too late to change their ways, but what we find is that when people do change their ways, we see remarkable benefits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf3212429511c0d322731047eaeed54e2589471c/0_445_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce46de4b47eb1855c5723d4ba9b8fb04","title":"philippa york macho culture cyclists coming out","story":"• York says there is an absence of support system for riders• ‘You can’t show any kind of weakness … you’ll get more abuse’Philippa York has suggested the macho culture in professional cycling is preventing riders from coming out as gay.York was King of the Mountains on the 1984 Tour de France while competing as Robert Millar and later disappeared from public life before transitioning to become a woman.It is 30 years since York struggled with gender dysphoria while still competing but she believes there is still an absence of a support system to allow an active rider to be openly homosexual. York was speaking before the Giro d’Italia which begins in Jerusalem on Friday, the first time the Grande Partenza – or start of the race – has been held outside Europe. There will be 175 riders competing for 22 teams and hundreds more backroom staff but York said her information was that none of them is openly gay.“There’s certainly no back up in any of the teams which would allow you to show any kind of gayness, anywhere on that gay spectrum,” she said.“It’s that whole macho culture of everybody’s straight white male and that’s it. The crazy thing is that the cycling model is set up by sponsorships, and those big sponsors, they’re usually big companies, they have a whole system of dealing with what I call the gay spectrum and they have no issue with it at all.“You can’t show any kind of weakness because, being gay, anywhere on that gay spectrum is seen as a weakness. In the macho world you can’t show that, because you’ll get more abuse from the side of the road than you get already.”York believes it will take at least a generation for the culture to change.“That is going to change when the young riders who are coming through school nowadays who get taught differently,” she said.The massive logistical operation of the Giro d’Italia was already under way on Monday with a Boeing 747 aircraft transporting the equipment, including several hundred bikes, to Israel. The race begins with a 9.7km time trial in Jerusalem on Friday.There will be two more stages in the country before the plane is loaded up again and flown the 2,000km to Sicily next Sunday when the Giro d’Italia transfers from Israel to Catania for the remainder of the race."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63dc81e5db76a184d70731d18dd572184a08dc46/0_47_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236e23e0b4a9f31a6745de7643a297ef","title":"david haye has one last chance to win back fans against tony bellew","story":"David Haye was once the most exciting heavyweight in the world. He was fast, powerful and smart in the ring, punching considerably above his weight, loud and controversial outside it, a charismatic magnet of controversy.Yet for all that he has achieved – world titles at cruiser and heavyweight and as much celebrity and money as any good-looking working-class south London boy could have asked for – there is little doubt that, at 37, he has fallen short of what he could have achieved in an era of flux.When the Hayemaker finally goaded his way into a showdown with Wladimir Klitschko in 2011, pulling off a masterpiece of aggressive marketing, he stubbed his toe. A string of injuries banjaxed two fights against Tyson Fury. His achilles gave up on him in the ring against Tony Bellew just over a year ago and he fell down some stairs on the eve of their scheduled rematch just before Christmas.Now he gets one more chance. He has stretched the patience of paying customers and opponents to the limit. At the 02 Arena in London on Saturday night – a few miles from where he grew up – Haye and Bellew go at it again.The Liverpudlian, a couple of years younger, will start a slight favourite, and that will suit Haye, who enjoys the added incentive of proving everyone wrong. He promises: “I’ve got something up my sleeve for Bellew.”He has been uncharacteristically quiet in the build-up this time, almost Zen-like in soaking up Bellew’s barbs. It is as if he is trying to con him into a sense of complacency. That probably will not happen, because he has annoyed Bellew to distraction in the past.Bellew (who has already starred in his own movie) is winning the battle for the gallery. On Twitter at the weekend he summed up the fighter’s code: “This time next week I’ll be punching someone in the face and be getting punched right back in the face! I’m actually excited at the thought of this! suppose what ever floats ya boat eh.” In that, at least, they have something in common. Haye loves a tear-up.Nevertheless, a trawl of social media reveals a lot of fans are sick and tired of Haye. Most of them have forgotten the good nights, the performances that thrilled, the crashing overhand rights that rendered opponents senseless and bewildered.Probably Haye’s last impressive display was stopping Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in five rounds. That was nearly six years ago. He said in his pomp he would retire on his 31st birthday. If fighters share a vice it is staying too long at the party. On Saturday night we’ll see if Haye has anything left to celebrate or is prepared finally to wander into the night.The dance has begun. But the tango boxing wants more than any other, the one that makes most sense and most cents – Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder – remains mired in online noise and baby-level exchanges across the ditch.The latest wheeze is that the American heavyweight who cannot fill a 19,000-seater in Brooklyn has gone straight to his British cash cow, bypassing Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, and put $50m on the table.Joshua – whose last three title defences have drawn more than a quarter of a million punters to Wembley and Cardiff – turns to Hearn, lifts an eyebrow, and the Matchroom boss says: “Leave it AJ, they’re not serious.”So the contest is still in round one: much positioning, the odd jab, nobody risking a big shot. It is like David Haye v Audley Harrison on a never-ending loop. Hearn is in New York pushing his middleweight Daniel Jacobs but reported that Wilder’s people failed to show for scheduled talks.Hearn, of course, is loving his name for one of Wilder’s representatives, Shelly Finkel: Shirley Winkle. Lou Di Bella, another of the American’s financial advisers, lashes out from his cot that this is just plain dumb. Meanwhile there is snarling in the cheap seats. Fans want some action.They are sucked into the ritual, believing nothing and everything, so long as the day of the big collision is drawn closer. They will complain that they cannot stand Hearn, or think that Wilder is dodging Joshua, or that no way can Deontay come up with the bucks he is said to have dangled in front of his rival.The only way to cope with the anxiety of such nonsense is to let it run out of steam. Sooner or later Hearn, perhaps with a nudge from his father, will corner the Americans in a hotel room somewhere and thrash out a deal that will make all of them millions they cannot afford to ignore.The problem is not the fighters. They want to get it on. And, understandably, they want to maximise their earnings. But their promoters, managers and lawyers, meanwhile, do not want any spare change leaking to the other side. And that, without exception, is always the story behind the story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62dd3f747d9f252a0d236a734c621464978c1766/0_3264_5739_3441/master/5739.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a08a7113a5edf9c2a9054107c2481f7","title":"puerile provincial and prophetic how the inbetweeners became a classic","story":"It had a lukewarm reception when it debuted 10 years ago, but Damon Beesley and Iain Morris’s show about suburban school friends has become that rare thing: a national-treasure sitcomWhen The Inbetweeners pitched up in 2008, there hadn’t been a hit British sitcom about teenagers since The Young Ones. In the US, teens existed in glossy California dramas or gross-out coming of age movies. In Britain, they featured in gritty films and series about crime and, more alarmingly, Skins – E4’s romp through the untowardly eventful lives of a gaggle of pill-popping, sexually reckless 16-year-olds. It was into this lopsided landscape that The Inbetweeners arrived and injected television’s teenage narrative with a dose of pure, unadulterated ordinariness.Narrated by goody-two-shoes teenager Will (Simon Bird), the show follows his move from private school to bog-standard comprehensive, where he makes bog-standard new friends. He meets perpetually lovelorn Simon (Joe Thomas), chronic bullshitter Jay (James Buckley) and nice-but-dim Neil (Blake Harrison). Iain Morris, who co-created the show with Damon Beesley, said he wanted suburbia to be the show’s fifth main character, and the overwhelming mediocrity of The Inbetweeners’ grey-skied commuter-belt setting is reflected in everything from the soundtrack (landfill indie) to the characters’ ambitions (try to get served in a pub).In many ways, The Inbetweeners was a very conventional sitcom, complete with slapstick scrapes and slickly concluded storylines. Cleaving to British comedy tradition, its on-screen leads, Bird and Thomas, were alumni of the Cambridge Footlights, and it stuck to age-old sitcom tropes like antagonism-glazed male bonding and romantic humiliation. But into this template, Morris and Beesley injected real life. From Simon’s humiliatingly yellow car to Jay’s pretend sexual exploits, the creators packed the show full of their real-life experiences (fans of Morris’s and Jimmy Carr’s mid-00s XFM show will remember the writer as a source of superb adolescence anecdotes). They also took care to mimic the way teenage boys spoke. Doing so meant The Inbetweeners broke new ground when it came to the level of crudity you would expect from a prime-time sitcom. But it worked. The Inbetweeners Movie took £13.22m at the UK box office on its opening weekend. (The most successful TV comedy spin-off before that was Borat, which managed £6.24m.) Its success was staggering and triggered a Gaelic TV and film renaissance when its Skye-based producer Chris Young used the money he had made to start Gaelic-language projects.This puerility made The Inbetweeners easy to dismiss, however its juvenility belied not only expertly constructed comedy, but lexical joy. Like every great sitcom, The Inbetweeners created its own language – popularising terms such as clunge, bus wanker and “friend” (the latter is all in the high-pitched delivery). It feels as if The Inbetweeners was the last comedy to permeate the cultural consciousness of young Britons in this way. Its dialogue passed into common parlance and its characters became archetypes (Jay, in particular, is useful shorthand for a whole category of human). That’s probably because it was broadcast at a time when the TV comedy as a unifying cultural touchstone was steadily disintegrating. Digital channels hadn’t totally poleaxed the concept of the national-treasure sitcom yet (Gavin \u0026amp Stacey, which debuted the year before on BBC Three, was similarly big news), but in the coming years streaming soon would – Netflix was introduced in the UK in 2012 – and viewership would fragment.The turn of the decade was a pivotal moment for television in general, but it was especially important for comedy. As blockbuster sitcoms died away, a new style of comedy was taking its place – one that focused on the people who always played the boring characters: women. As a show about failure, disappointment and rejection, it feels faintly ridiculous to view The Inbetweeners as a tale of four middle-class white men and their privilege, but it is true that the show seemed to put more effort into thinking up slang terms for vagina than giving depth to its female characters. Which makes one facet of The Inbetweeners’ legacy even odder: it created a template for the female-centric sitcom to thrive. Shows such Derry Girls, Some Girls and Drifters (whose leads appeared in the first The Inbetweeners Movie, and is executive-produced by Morris and Beesley) have all been referred to as the “female Inbetweeners”, while Caroline and Caitlin Moran’s sister-sitcom Raised By Wolves picked up where the masturbation-obsessed teen boys left off. Without the original, these shows might never have been possible – they flipped the script that The Inbetweeners wrote.The Inbetweeners also existed at a particular point in teenage life. When it began in 2008, Facebook had just about taken root in the social lives of teenagers the show’s final episode aired 12 days before the launch of Instagram. The latter overhauled teenage life, making adolescents cautious curators of their own image. Teen years no longer seem like a place for fashion sins and horrendous character-building scrapes but a prime time to start building your brand. You probably couldn’t make a show about teenagers today without having social media at its core. For that reason, The Inbetweeners seems like a harbinger of the end of two eras: both as one of the UK’s final sitcom phenomena, and a portrait of a humiliating, awkward and tedious paradise lost.The Inbetweeners is available on All 4 throughout May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/250bcb3f8f6a58551e95c44569fbb50af686ef4c/0_185_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=02f9559dc2272a9683dc9af6c4d5570c","title":"heavy smoker kim jong un shunned cigarettes during peace talks","story":"New details emerge about North Korean leader’s vices at summit with South Korean president last weekKim Jong-un confirmed that he enjoyed a drink during Friday’s historic summit with Moon Jae-in, but it was his refusal to give in to his other vice that has caught the attention of the South Korean media.Over the course of their meetings, Kim, who is known to be a heavy smoker, did not light up once in Moon’s presence, apparently out of respect for the South Korean president, who is 31 years his senior.The absence of a lit cigarette at any point in the proceedings came as a surprise. In official North Korean photographs, Kim is often seen with a cigarette dangling between his fingers, even on visits to a school and children’s hospital and, last July, during a missile launch.But on Friday, the cigarettes were nowhere to be seen, including during his lengthy al fresco bonding session with Moon on a pedestrian bridge in Panmunjom, even though officials had left an ashtray on the table. Nor did he make use of the ashtray placed in front of him during his icebreaking talks with Moon in a reception room at Peace House.While it’s safe to assume that Kim enjoyed a postprandial cigarette back in the north after he and Moon broke for lunch, he reportedly succumbed to nicotine cravings just once on South Korean soil, quietly slipping out of the crowded banquet hall in the evening to smoke in a separate room.Respect for Moon aside, South Korean officials believe that Kim had recognised that lighting up in the middle of talks about peace and denuclearisation might have come across as impolitic.“We heard that Kim Jong-un was a heavy smoker. But we could see him refrain from smoking in public, considering the symbolism of the inter-Korean summit and the number of South Korean and North Korean officials at the scene,” a presidential official told the Korea Herald.Kim’s self-discipline did not extend to alcohol, however. He gratefully accepted every offer of “strong liquor” throughout the banquet, the Korea Herald noted.It isn’t clear if Kim’s resistance crumbled as soon as he and his wife, Ri Sol-ju, arrived back in Pyongyang, where his smoking habit was the topic of discussion during a recent meeting to prepare for the summit.In March, the head of South Korean’s national security council, Chung Eui-yong, left one North Korean official “frozen in terror” when he told Kim he should give up smoking for the sake of his health, according to Japan’s Asahi Shimbun newspaper. There was relief all round when Ri quickly intervened, clapping her hands and saying: “I’m always asking him to quit, but he won’t listen to me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b23878afff45380f73da12ac0d50c96c662d2b5d/0_100_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce519ecf015f351aa12cdeaebd5161f9","title":"ksenia sobchak reality tv star ran against putin tsar for years","story":"Say what you like about Ksenia Sobchak\u0026nbsp– and in Russia they say a\u0026nbsplot of things\u0026nbsp– but she knows how to work a\u0026nbspcrowd. Talking to a\u0026nbsppacked room at Pushkin House, a venue for Russian cultural events in London, she starts with a\u0026nbspjoke. And not a\u0026nbspbad one: “You know, in Russia we say there are three things you can’t choose: your parents, your gender and your\u0026nbsppresident.”We meet before her sold-out appearance at Pushkin House. The night before, she had been at a\u0026nbspdebate hosted by Andrew Neil (whose Scottish accent she struggled to decipher) for the Spectator magazine. She is flustered, tired and has a\u0026nbspcold, but as soon as she is asked a\u0026nbspquestion, she relaxes and segues into politician mode\u0026nbsp– and you remember that she has been watching people do this kind of thing since she was a\u0026nbspchild. Her father, Anatoly Sobchak, was mayor of St Petersburg from 1991 to\u0026nbsp1996.Russia’s most prominent opposition candidate is Alexei Navalny, who called upon those opposed to Putin to boycott the elections entirely. This is where Sobchak’s candidacy becomes hard to fathom. She paints herself as someone who loves politics, wants change for her country and is in a\u0026nbspposition to run. Her platform includes speaking out about political prisoners and championing human rights activists. But if she is a\u0026nbsptrue liberal, why take part in the pantomime at all? There are many competing views within Russia about her decision to run: that she is being used\u0026nbsp– wittingly or otherwise\u0026nbsp– to discredit the liberal opposition that she is a\u0026nbspstooge and a\u0026nbspscapegoat that she’s a\u0026nbsppawn in Putin’s game that it’s all a\u0026nbspbig extension of a\u0026nbspreality show, much like the ones she fronted on Russian television for\u0026nbspyears.Between 2004 and 2012, Sobchak was the host of Dom 2, Russia’s version of Big Brother, and presented numerous other TV programmes. She was also in films and made a\u0026nbsprap video. Despite turning her back on all this to follow a\u0026nbsppolitical path, it hasn’t stopped most of the coverage in Russia and abroad referring to her as “the ex-Playboy model dubbed ‘Russia’s Paris Hilton’.” While that description isn’t entirely inaccurate, it doesn’t really reflect who she is: a\u0026nbspcomplex hybrid of perestroika royalty, modern Russian celebrity and elite\u0026nbspliberalism.Whose side is she on, though? As the polls closed last month, Sobchak was engaged in an argument live on television with Navalny, who was barred from standing for election because of a\u0026nbspsuspended prison sentence for fraud. (Navalny had argued that only those in prison are barred from running, but the ban was upheld.) Navalny accused Sobchak of accepting cash to run and claimed she was an “instrument” of Putin: “You have become the champion of hypocrisy.” He added, as she sat opposite, shaking her head: “You came to me at two in the morning a\u0026nbspmonth before you announced your candidacy and you said, sitting in my kitchen, drinking tea: ‘They’re offering me a\u0026nbsplot of money. I\u0026nbspdon’t know what to do.’” She replied on air: “That’s not true and you know it. You’re\u0026nbsplying.”A month on, she says this episode reflects worse on Navalny. “I\u0026nbspthink Navalny has put himself in an extremely uncomfortable position,” she says. “It’s ridiculous nonsense. But let’s say what he says is true. Why didn’t he say something immediately after this supposed conversation with me? If it’s true, then he concealed life-changing information for half a\u0026nbspyear at a\u0026nbsptime when the country was holding elections.” It’s a\u0026nbspfair point. But, as always with Russian politics (or, to be fair, politics anywhere), someone is concealing their agenda and it is not clear\u0026nbspwho.In another extraordinary TV appearance last year, Sobchak was pitted against two male interviewers, who harangued her about her candidacy while a\u0026nbsplarge screen behind her flashed up pictures from her life as a\u0026nbspparty girl. At the start of the programme, one presenter sneered: “As you know, on this programme we usually cover political and social problems. But in a\u0026nbspdeparture from our usual theme, today we’ll be talking about show business.” At one point, she was asked whether she would debate with Putin. (Putin never lowers himself to debate anyone. Why would he?) She replied: “Oh, come on. I’ll cut my own hand off if Putin takes part in a\u0026nbspdebate. It never happens.” One of the presenters replied: “Please don’t cut off your sweet little\u0026nbsphand.”Later, at the Pushkin House event, she shows the audience a\u0026nbsphint of her true agenda: to be part of change, but also possibly part of the movement pushing for a\u0026nbspliberal candidate chosen by Putin. She suggests this is the most logical outcome six years from now. (Putin has hinted that he will not stand again in 2024, so the narrative is becoming about succession. Will he choose another KGB alumnus, like him? Or someone more liberal?) She speaks openly on the case of the poisoning of the Skripals, saying she has no insider knowledge but would be very surprised if it were ordered by the state so close to an election. Of Putin, she says, fascinatingly: “He has been a\u0026nbsptsar for many years. He is not thinking of himself as being a\u0026nbspperson. He is above that. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Eighteen years. You can\u0026nbspimagine.”Sobchak’s great strength\u0026nbsp– her insight into Putin’s mindset\u0026nbsp– also comes across as a\u0026nbspweakness. She may understand the situation perfectly and be able to articulate it (she is certainly a great speaker). But she can come across as an apologist, as Navalny has hinted. Take this explanation for Putin’s victory: “Why are Russians so ‘anti-liberal’? Because Putin and his team really did win a\u0026nbspdecisive victory. They convinced people that they are surrounded by enemies. And that it’s only possible to survive this new cold war with a\u0026nbspstrong leader. These arguments worked well on people. They really do believe that Putin is the only person who can hold things\u0026nbsptogether.”Inevitably, Sobchak’s personal history complicates things. She has known Putin since she was a\u0026nbspchild as well as being mayor of St Petersburg, her father was a\u0026nbspmentor to Putin, then his deputy. Anatoly Sobchak supported Putin’s presidential ambitions. He died in 2000, officially of a\u0026nbspheart condition, but among other theories there were rumours about Putin’s involvement. (Referring to the rumours, Sobchak said in an interview with the dissident author Masha Gessen in the New Yorker last year: “That’s just unthinkable. If that is true then the world is an entirely different place than I\u0026nbspimagine.”) She recently made a\u0026nbspfilm about her father, The Case of Anatoly Sobchak, which features a\u0026nbsppreviously unseen interview with Putin. It will be released in Russia in May and she is hoping for a British release, too. I\u0026nbspwonder if this visit is a\u0026nbsptesting ground for another rebranding based on this documentary. After all, by cementing her father’s legacy, she could further her own career. His influence represents a\u0026nbspcontradiction: at the height of his career, he was feted as a\u0026nbspgreat liberaliser. And yet Putin, his mentee, seems to have taken a\u0026nbspdifferent path. How does that add up? At Pushkin House, she tells the audience, cryptically: “You will never see Putin like he is in this\u0026nbspmovie.”Meanwhile, her political future hangs in the balance. Last month, Sobchak and the politician Dmitry Gudkov announced they were forming a\u0026nbspparty with the provisional name of Partiya Peremen (Party of Change). Gudkov, 38, was a\u0026nbspmember of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, between 2011 and\u0026nbsp2016.“I’m trying to work out what’s next,” she says. “We are experimenting with crowdfunding for this new party.” She alternates between optimism and stoicism. “I\u0026nbsphad to try to influence the situation somehow,” she says of her election failure. “I\u0026nbspdon’t know what will happen next. There are not very many opportunities to change the situation. But you have to try.” What would her father think? “Seeing as my father loved me, I\u0026nbspknow he’d have one piece of advice: Don’t go into\u0026nbsppolitics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/699ba087647a5c49ee50dd20aa5e39a3401ab6d0/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8849b4dc0c758d51a32437c866cbdb5","title":"labour backs push for public ownership registers in uk overseas territories","story":"Shadow chancellor says government needs to show it is serious about clamping down on tax avoidance Labour’s frontbench has asked its MPs to support a backbench amendment that would force Theresa May to tell Britain’s overseas territories to introduce public ownership registers in an attempt to prevent them from being exploited by the global super-rich.The party’s three line whip backing for the amendment, which has attracted the support of 20 rebel Conservatives, makes it more likely that the government will be defeated on the transparency measure in the Commons on Tuesday.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the government needed to show it was “serious about clamping down on tax avoidance and taking on the vested interests of the super rich” by supporting the backbench amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill.Its proponents, Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell and Labour MP Margaret Hodge, argue that if the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands are forced to introduce public ownership registers it will stem the flow of “dirty money” around the world and into the UK.They say that “transparency is vital in the fight against money laundering and tax avoidance by crooks, kleptocrats and terrorist gangs” in a joint article for the Evening Standard. Campaign group Global Witness estimates that £68bn flowed out of Russia via the UK overseas territories between 2007 and 2016.David Cameron and George Osborne promised to introduce public ownership registers in the overseas territories in 2013 but the measure was dropped when May took over as prime minister. The amendment, which has the support of Ken Clarke, Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, as well as the SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, asks the 14 territories to comply by the end of 2020.Number 10 has said it will study whether the proposed amendment will be effective, although government whips had suggested that implementation could be delayed until 2025 in an attempt to peel off the rebels that Mitchell insisted had not been successful.Opposition to the measure in the overseas territories has been led by the British Virgin Islands. The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), of which the BVI is an associate member, said it was unfair to target the BVI at a time when the region is recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma.Allen Chastanet, the prime minister of Saint Lucia and chairman of the OECS, added there was an an “ongoing frustration” among member states at “having to continually battle the unilateral shifting of goal posts on the financial services front”. The OECS also complained that the amendment did not target the UK crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and so appeared to “specifically target the Caribbean” – although MPs supporting the amendment said they hoped to turn to the crown dependencies in due course.Labour also said it intended to campaign further on the issue and unveiled a series of “internet posters” with the strapline: “Hostile Environment? Not for Tory donors” which it intended to promote online in the belief that it can successfully attack the government on this issue.Duncan Hames, director of policy at anti-corruption campaign group Transparency International UK, added: “Without leaks like the Panama and Paradise Papers, it is increasingly clear that only public registers can provide the accountability to expose corrupt iniduals seeking to hide their identities and sources of wealth.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479492.1525112611!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier tries to calm politics around unresolved border issue","story":"Speaking in Dundalk during a two-day visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has urged rapid agreement by June on the scope of any British alignment with the single market. Video: DFA\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief negotiator on Brexit Michel Barnier speaking to journalists in Newry on Monday. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesThe European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, came to the Border again and crossed it but first had to deny that the “backstop” option for the post-Brexit frontier was an EU land grab for Northern Ireland.The suggestion, in a question from a journalist with the pro-Brexit Daily , shows the extent to which the political noise in London around the negotiations on Britain’s departure is making Barnier’s job so difficult.“We have no intention of questioning the UK’s constitutional order,” Barnier told the All-Island Civic Forum on Brexit in Dundalk. “This is none of our business.”Almost two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and less than a year until its departure, nobody is any clearer about what Brexit means for the Border – and the temperature around Brexit is still too high to figure it out.Barnier, on his second visit to the Border since Brexit, said this was exactly why he had come to visit both sides of the Border: to find “technical and practical solutions to assure safety controls” that protect the EU’s single market and, he suggested, the UK’s internal market too.“We have to de-dramatise this point to avoid any kind of ideology,” he said.“There is absolutely no question of Ireland or the European Union being interested in a land grab,” stressed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, sharing a stage with Barnier and Tánaiste Simon Coveney.The clock is ticking down to the next critical deadline in the Brexit negotiations, the European Council summit of EU leaders at the end of June, and the issue of how to maintain an invisible border remains unresolved.So far, the only solution on the negotiating table is the backstop, the default position that will effectively keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market.It is an option the UK has agreed to and conceded should be covered by a legal text in the Brexit treaty, but it does not want it and has so far failed to agree to the legal text or proposed an alternative acceptable to the EU.In an attempt to keep the pressure on the British to come up with other concrete proposals, Barnier, Varadkar and Coveney displayed a unified line of offence here near the Border. The three were “absolutely united,” the Taoiseach said, in seeking “meaningful progress” by the June summit.Barnier suggested June was a “stepping stone” to October’s deadline for a final Brexit treaty but warned that until there was agreement on an operational backstop, there was “a risk” of a disorderly Brexit.He inadvertently had a dig at Davis when he took a question from a Northern Irish journalist about Davis believing the backstop wasn’t necessary.“Who?” he asked, not quite catching the Northern accent. The backstop was there not to change the UK’s red lines (leaving the EU single market and customs union), he replied, but “because of the UK’s red lines”.The heaviest punches were thrown by Opposition politicians during the forum’s plenary session.Labour leader Brendan Howlin referred to the “civil war” that had erupted in the UK Tory party over Brexit. Independent Alliance Minister Shane Ross suggested that England’s difficulty should be Ireland’s opportunity.“If they insist on imposing this self-inflicted wound, it is probably something that we can take advantage of,” he said, pointing to the opportunities for financial services and tourism.While Barnier wants no drama, no visit to the Border area by anyone so connected with Brexit could avoid it.Hours before his visit, DUP leader Arlene Foster questioned Barnier’s honesty as a broker. He was “not ready to engage in polemics,” Barnier replied, calmly.For some hard Brexiteers, they do not seem ready to move beyond them.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479500.1525112908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"with no sense of direction theresa may is the plaything of events","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May arrives for a visit to Brooklands Primary School in Sale, near Manchester, on Monday as part of the Conservative Party’s local election campaign. Photograph: Oli ScarffPA WireFive years after her arrival in parliament, Amber Rudd was given the UK energy department to run. Her credentials for such a strategic role in a $2.9 trillion economy were her sound intellect and common sense. An unquantifiable hunch that she was doing well spurred her promotion to the Home Office a year later, where she had to master another wad of detail from scratch. On Sunday, she resigned over the mistreatment of the Windrush migrants, or rather a false statement about the policy behind it.The light-speed rise and fall, the intellectual generalism tested to destruction, the almost holy significance put on matters of communication: Rudd’s was the echt career in British politics. It could only be more typical of our public life if she returns to cabinet before long with another portfolio to wing her way through. Her replacement, Sajid Javid, who is running his fourth department in as many years, should be on his fifth by then.The British state is set up for low-key shambles. What permanence there is resides in a civil service that has interests, if not beliefs, of its own. Indeed, Conservatives wonder about the source of the leak that did for Rudd.A good prime minister can withstand these administrative fumbles and 10-a-penny resignations by espousing a central mission. Margaret Thatcher weathered crises as serious as the Westland affair because her quest for economic reform put them in perspective as transient news stories. Theresa May has no quest beyond Brexit and her own survival. There is little in the way of a domestic policy programme. Parliament is scrutinising such momentous legislation as the Civil Liability Bill, with its new measures against vexatious motor insurance claims. In the air is the kind of listlessness that attends the ninth year of a premiership. It is the second year of May’s.Having promised to stand for more than Brexit, the prime minister has managed to stand for less (given her constructive ambiguity on even that question). Her circumstances provide her with good excuses. Without a majority in either house of parliament, she cannot venture any contentious bills. Without the political capital to fire senior ministers, she cannot impose herself on government. While talks with the EU proceed, she cannot devote herself to anything else. Nor does her legislative inhibition have to be a problem for the nation. There are worse things than an inactive government, such as an active government. Savour this break from do-somethingism, the most righteous religion of our time, while it lasts.The problem is for May herself. With no sense of direction, she is the plaything of events. Each resignation – there have been five in six months – matters more than it should. Losses in the local elections this week would be no trouble to brush off for a prime minister with projects of their own to pursue. In May’s case, losses will renew gossip about her position.The Windrush scandal is traceable to decisions taken before Rudd’s time. Critics say that May’s own tenure at the Home Office is returning to dog her. They cannot know how right they are.The Home Office is a (necessarily) negative department. Its job is to stop bad things from happening, of which crime, terror and illegal immigration are the most serious. In her six years in that confoundingly avant garde building, May never had to create, only enforce. It is life-and-death work but inadequate preparation for Downing Street, to which parliament and the executive look for drive.There have been prime ministers of her reticent type before but they tend to be paired with a more dynamic chancellor of the exchequer. May has Philip Hammond, who compounds her own caution. The result is a government that avoids outright crisis in favour of ennui and drift. A very small mercy, that. May’s admirers still talk about her debut speech as prime minister as though Cicero is up there kicking himself for having been beaten to it. Even at the time, though, it was colour-by-numbers flannel about “burning injustice”, influenced by advisers who are no longer with her. She was never a seer. She was a conscientious, civic-minded politician who needs instructions to be getting on with.That was what Britain required in the summer of 2016, when zanier Tories were vying for power after the Brexit vote. But there are diminishing returns to mere diligence. Rudd’s departure would be a non-event for a busier prime minister. It matters to this one, but then so does every glancing blow. Britain can live without a governing vision. Whether May can is less clear. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

I\u0027m not happy. I want to die. It\u0027s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.My feeling is that an old person like myself should have full citizenship rights including the right of assisted suicide, he added.Prof Goodall made headlines in 2016 when his university tried to force him from his role on the grounds that, at the age of 102, he was no longer fit to be on campus.Prof Goodall with Carol O\u0026#39Neill of Exit International, which advocates for voluntary euthanasiaAssisted suicide is illegal in most countries around the world and was banned in Australia until the state of Victoria became the first to legalise the practice last year.But that legislation, which takes effect from June 2019, only applies to terminally ill patients of sound mind and a life expectancy of less than six months.At the age of 104, David Goodall says he is ready to die despite not having a terminal illnessOther states in Australia have debated euthanasia in the past, but the proposals have always been defeated, mostly recently in New South Wales state last year.Exit International, which is helping Mr Goodall make the trip, said it was unjust that one of Australia\u0027s oldest and most prominent citizens should be forced to travel to the other side of the world to die with dignity.A peaceful, dignified death is the entitlement of all who want it. And a person should not be forced to leave home to achieve it, it said on its website Monday.The group has launched a GoFundMe campaign to get plane tickets for Goodall and his helper upgraded to business class from economy and has so far raised more than Aus$17,000 (£9,000).Prof Goodall, an honorary research associate at Perth\u0027s Edith Cowan University, fought attempts to banish him from the campus two years ago.After an uproar and support from scientists globally, the decision was reversed.He has produced dozens of research papers and until recently continued to review and edit for different ecology journals.Ramadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranWhat is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

A diet rich in fresh legumes such as peas and beans was also linked to a later menopause, with a 90g portion daily associated with a one year delay.And on average, meat eaters experienced menopause more than a year later than vegetarians.A higher intake of vitamins B6 and zinc also appeared to delay the onset, the study found.The study was observational - meaning it did not demonstrate that the foods caused the later menopause..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}The age at which menopause begins can have serious health implications for some womenJanet Cade, study co-authorWomen who go through the menopause early are at an increased risk of osteoporosis and heart disease.However, those who do so later are more likely to develop breast, womb, ovarian cancers.Study co-author Janet Cade, professor of nutritional epidemiology, said: The age at which menopause begins can have serious health implications for some women.A clear understanding of how diet affects the start of natural menopause will be very beneficial to those who may already be at risk or have a family history of certain complications related to menopause.Researchers said the antioxidents found in legumes might affect the maturation and release of eggs, helping to preserve menstruation for longer.Omega 3 fatty acids, abundant in oily fish, are also thought to stimulate antioxidant capacity in the body.Meanwhile, refined carbohydrates can increase the risk of insulin resistance.This can interfere with the activity of sex hormones and boosting oestrogen levels, leading to quicker depletion of egg supply, the researchers said.The women provided information on potentially influential factors such as weight history, physical activity levels, reproductive history, and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT).They also estimated the quantities of 217 foodstuffs they ate every day by completing a food frequency questionnaire.Lead author Yashvee Dunneram, of the School of Food Science and Nutrition, said: This study is the first to investigate the links between inidual nutrients and a wide variety of food groups and age at natural menopause in a large cohort of British women.But further studies are needed to improve understanding on how this may impact health and wellbeing.Kathy Abernethy, chairman of the British Menopause Society, said: “We welcome research like this as age of menopause can affect future health, with women experiencing menopause at a young age having greater health risks later in life if they do not receive appropriate treatment.”Pointing out that the study was observational - and did not prove particular foods caused an earlier or later menopause, she said there were good reasons to aim for a healthy diet.“The foods  linked to healthy menopause, such as oily fish and legumes are also good for other health measures so always to be recommended. Whether or not you can change the age of your own menopause simply by diet is less clear,” she said.Dr Channa Jayasena, Clinical Senior Lecturer and Consultant in Reproductive Endocrinology at Imperial College London said: “This is a large study looking at diet and the age of menopause in a population of women. The body’s metabolism plays an important role regulating ovulation and having periods.“The authors suggest that women who took more refined carbs, savoury snacks and being vegetarian had an earlier menopause. It is tempting to speculate that this provides a recipe for delaying menopause. Unfortunately, a big limitation of these observational studies, is their inability to prove that dietary behaviour actually causes early menopause. Until we have that type of proof, I see no reason for people to change their diet.”Nutrition and dietingRamadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranWhat is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

The plant, known for its sweet scent and delicate clusters of pink flowers, is thought to be the first East Asian rose to reach Europe some time in the 18th century.The scientists, led by Mohammed Bendahmane, from the University of Lyon in France, made comparisons with the genomes of other plants including strawberry, apricot and peach, to explore rose ancestry and evolution.They uncovered more than 36,000 protein-coding genes, and a biochemical pathway that co-ordinated the regulation of scent and colour.A number of candidate genes for flowering were identified which could in future be targeted to produce genetically improved rose cultivars.“If you go to the market and look at the cut roses, they won’t smell like anything. They smell like plastic,” Dr Bendahmane told The Times.A rose on display at the 2016 Hampton Court Flower show“I hope we will be able to change how these flowers look in the future and make them last longer with more of a scent, which is lost the longer roses stay in a vase.“They could also be made more brightly-coloured.”The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is expected to help researchers and breeders to manipulate rose flowering and colour, strengthen scent, or increase vase life.Writing in the journal, the scientists said: Reconstructing regulatory and secondary metabolism pathways allowed us to propose a model of interconnected regulation of scent and flower colour.This genome provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms governing rose traits and should accelerate improvement in roses.A team from the University of Lyon identified the enzyme that helps produce roses\u0027 intoxicating aroma three years ago.They said the key lay in encouraging the roses to produce greater levels of an organic compound called geraniol, which is produced in petals.Arthur Bouquet, an American horticulturalist, claimed that just 50 per cent of today\u0027s roses have a noticeable scent, compared with 75 per cent in the 19th century.Bugs talk to each other to help evade detection Ramadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranWhat is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

I know that there are people talking about these documents not being authentic. I can confirm with you, for you, that these documents are real, they are authentic.Asked whether the United States had been aware for many years that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program - dubbed Project Amad - before 2004, Pompeo said: That\u0027s partly true. The existence of the Amad program ended roughly in December 2003, January 2004.It\u0027s accurate to say that the knowledge of that, the fact of that, has been known for quite some time, but there are thousands of new documents and new information, the top US diplomat added.We\u0027re still going through it, there\u0027s still a lot of work to do to figure out the scope and scale of it, but it is the case that there is new information about that programme.Supporters of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which President Donald Trump is expected to pull the US out from on May 12, have argued that Netanyahu\u0027s intelligence release deals simply with a historic Iranian program and does not prove they are in breach of the 2015 accord.A spokesman for the UK government, a signatory of the deal, said it would continue to back the deal, adding: We have never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions. That is why the IAEA inspection regime agreed as part of the Iran nuclear deal is one of the most extensive and robust in the history of international nuclear accords.The spokesman added: “It remains a vitally important way of independently verifying that Iran is adhering to the deal and that Iran’s nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.”But Pompeo argued that Israel\u0027s new claims had changed the debate about the Iran deal.This will, I think, spell out the scope and scale of the program that they undertook there, and I think that it makes clear that at the very least the Iranians have continued to lie to their own people, he told reporters.The Iranians have consistently taken the position that they\u0027ve never had a programme like this. This will belie any notion that there wasn\u0027t a program.Pompeo said that Trump would have to determine whether the United States feels Iran is in violation of the deal, and said US translators and analysts are still trawling through the intelligence provided by the Israelis.Please review our commenting policyRamadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranWhat is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

Many administrative functions will be duplicated meaning some jobs are highly likely to go.Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who worked at Asda’s head office for 11 years, told the House of Commons that he did not believe the site would survive a few years after the merger.He added that distribution centres “will be absolutely hammered a year or two years down the line if this merger goes ahead”.For shop-floor staff which make up the majority of Sainsbury’s and Asda’s 350,000 employees the competition watchdog’s investigation will cause concern.In a similar probe when Morrisons bought Safeway in a far smaller deal in 2003, the regulator forced the supermarkets to offload 53 stores.So a Sainsbury’s-Asda probe would surely require the sale of stores in locations where the combined company would limit choice for shoppers. Coupe admitted as much on Friday morning but said he would miraculously not cut jobs as a result. How?“Even if we have to est stores they will be sold as trading entities,” he said. In other words, a rival will buy them and they will stay open.But just who would snap them up? Only Tesco and Morrisons would remain as potential purchasers out of a new “big three” of supermarkets.It’s far from certain they would look to acquire large numbers of stores.The space race that saw supermarkets aggressively add new shops throughout the 2000s, particularly large out-of-town locations, is well and truly over. What the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Sainsbury’s merger with Asda likely to face competition watchdog probeSainsbury’s grows sales but warns bank profits will take a hit in 2018Sainsbury’s share price soars as it unveils details of Asda mergerCustomers habits have changed. Fewer consumers do one big weekly shop, instead preferring regular trips to convenience stores or shopping online.Aldi and Lidl are adding stores at a rapid rate but much of Asda and Sainsbury’s portfolio is likely to be a bad fit for the discounters, both of which favour smaller, more centrally located shops. Some commentators have touted bargain retailers such as B\u0026ampM as potential purchasers.Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, says it is “inevitable” that the merged company will sell branches and he sees Morrison’s as the prime beneficiary.But it will only buy the profitable stores in good locations that become available. It is too early to say which Sainsbury’s or Asdas will disappear, or even how many, but we can make some guesses. Analysis by Patrick O’Brien, research director at Global Data Retail, found 197 Asda stores that had a Sainsbury’s in the same postcode area (eg PL1). He broke this down further to reveal 75 areas where they are in the same postcode sector (eg: PL1 5). These could be the first for the chop.No plans to close any stores, but with 75 Asda stores in the same postcode district as a Sainsbury’s store (excluding Sainsbury’s Locals) we expect the CMA will demand disposals pic.twitterW2oYyPbr2nOn job cuts, Lim says the merger will speed up a process that has been underway for a decade.“The number of people employed in retail has been shrinking by 1 per cent per year since 2008. The industry doesn’t require as much space and the role of employees is changing.” he said.“If the merger does result in redundancies through being forced to sell stores or through cutting back office teams, ultimately this is about making a company that is fit for purpose in the future with a business model that works.”Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, said that despite what has been stated officially, “stores would have to close”.“That’s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would, of course, be a bad thing for those store employees.”During a debate on the takeover on Monday, Conservative MP Stephen Kerr said the concentration of supermarket power could have a “potentially devastating effect” on suppliers.The two largest players would control 60 per cent of the market, allowing them to dictate terms to an even greater degree than at present.For Sainsbury’s and Asda executives, the logic behind a £10bn supermarket mega-merger is clear – for shoppers, suppliers and workers the positives are less obvious.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sterling dropped 0.43 per cent to €1.3723 following Friday’s decline of more than 1 per cent after official figures revealed the UK economy almost slowed to a standstill in the first quarter. Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May interest rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards. “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the Bank of England, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler.

It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.The introduction does appear to be a test ahead of rolling it out on Facebook more broadly, however, and so the feature is expected to come to more people in the future.Facebook says that the button is for voting down comments that are abusive or disrespectful, so that they will not get promoted to the top of a discussion. As such, it mostly functions like the downvote button on Reddit, allowing people to express their dislike of a comment and offset any positive reactions it might be getting.MPs laugh at Facebook boss during intense grilling in parliamentIn doing so, the feature should be able to make conversations on the platform less centred around those comments that generate the most engagement – whether good or bad.Facebook has been struggling with how exactly to integrate a dislike button since at least 2015, when Mark Zuckerberg noted that not every moment is a good moment. He also noted that any feature would have to be carefully designed to avoid spreading negativity or to be used for bullying.To solve that, Facebook introduced its Reactions – allowing people to not only like something, but also to offer a range of other reactions, such as anger or laughter. But doing so introduced yet another problem: reacting angrily still counted as a reaction, and so content that made people upset was still being engaged with and promoted on the site.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

It\u0027s clear that the government must develop a national alcohol strategy to address the harm they and their families face, and include treatment at its heart to reduce the suffering of the four in every five who currently do not access the services they need.This report shows very clearly what action is needed and we urge policy-makers, practitioners and service providers to join together to implement these recommendations to help the hundreds of thousands of people who are in desperate need of support.Press Association contributed to this report. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sterling dropped 0.43 per cent to €1.3723 following Friday’s decline of more than 1 per cent after official figures revealed the UK economy almost slowed to a standstill in the first quarter. Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May interest rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards. “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the Bank of England, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler.

It also helps both humans and animals to navigate, and protects our telecommunication and satellite systems.Substance that gives birds power to see Earth’s magnetic field foundIf the two magnetic poles were to switch places, something that has happened periodically over the course of Earth’s history, all of this would be compromised.Since 1840, the year scientists began to measure such things, the global strength of the Earth’s magnetic field has been declining at a rate of around 5 per cent per century.This weakening, combined with the expansion of a particularly weak area in the planet’s magnetic field called the South Atlantic Anomaly, led to speculation that Earth’s magnetic fields were about to\u0026nbspreverse.The last time such a “geomagnetic reversal” or “excursion” happened was 780,000 years ago, but coverage of this phenomenon has suggested such an\u0026nbspevent is right around the corner.\u0026nbspAn extract from a book by journalist Alanna Mitchell was published on the science website Undark.The book was titled The Spinning Magnet: The Electromagnetic Force That Created the Modern World — and Could Destroy It, and the extract included a warning that it was “time to wake up to the dangers and start preparing” for a magnetic pole reversal.This warning was picked up with gusto and soon many other articles were popping up warning of the dangers of an imminent pole reversal.However, the new study suggests the worst of these fears may have been unwarranted.Based on the Earth’s history of flipping its magnetic field, something which can be calculated based on magnetics minerals in rocks, they think such an event is unlikely to happen any time soon.“There has been speculation that we are about to experience a magnetic polar reversal or excursion,” said Professor Richard Holme, a geomagnetism expert at the University of Liverpool.Why the Earth’s magnetic poles could be about to swap places – and how“However, by studying the two most recent excursion events, we show that neither bear resemblance to current changes in the geomagnetic field and therefore it is probably unlikely that such an event is about to happen.Our research suggests instead that the current weakened field will recover without such an extreme event, and therefore is unlikely to reverse.Instead, the scientists predict it may take thousands of years before Earth’s magnetic field reverses again.Scientists are certainly aware of the possibility that the Earth’s magnetic field will flip its polarity at some point in the future. As Nasa states in a post on its website from 2011: “Reversals are the rule, not the exception”.In the Undark extract, Ms Mitchell quotes physicist Dr Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado, Boulder saying he fears parts of the planet will become uninhabitable during such a reversal.However, the consensus still seems to be that even if such an event did take place, its outcomes would not be as serious as some commentators have made out:“Many doomsday theorists have tried to take this natural geological occurrence and suggest it could lead to Earth\u0027s destruction,” Nasa continued in their post.“But would there be any dramatic effects? The answer, from the geologic and fossil records we have from hundreds of past magnetic polarity reversals, seems to be \u0027no.\u0027”Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer.

Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade.

The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.\u0026#13He added that he completed a free first aid course in February specialising in CPR for babies.“We are in a remote area it is a good thing to have,” he said.The particular course was organised by a mother working with St Andrews First Aid, whose own child had been saved by CPR, “Whether you are a mummy, daddy, nana or grandpa, just do an infant CPR course as soon as you can, as a general CPR course does not teach you the same things, it is different for adults and children,” Mr Brown said.Tobermory RNLI Lifeboat, which Mr Brown volunteers for, praised him on their Facebook page.“First aid training is for all not just emergency services personnel, they wrote. “We are so proud of our volunteer crew member Alec and even more pleased that Ruaridh has made a full recovery and looking forward to seeing him at the Station barbecue next month.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Cambridge Analytica insisted the Facebook data it received was obtained legally and that it was not used in the Brexit referendum.Mr Banks and Eldon Insurance have denied that the company shared any data with either Leave.EU or with Cambridge Analytica – and insisted the data consultancy did no work for its campaign.AIQ, meanwhile, says it has never been a part of either Cambridge Analytica or SCL, its parent firm, nor entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.However, the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, is investigating both Leave.EU and Mr Banks over possible breaches of the Data Protection Act, issuing “information notices” requiring specified cooperation.Her office also raided Cambridge Analytica’s offices, as part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum.A few days ago, Ms Denham publicly accused AIQ of failing to co-operate with her inquiry, saying: “We are considering the legal steps available to obtain the information.”Of the 87 Facebook users whose personal data was shared with Cambridge Analytica, more than one million live in the UK, the company has acknowledged.“One million people was the margin of the win in the Brexit referendum,” Ms Sandbach pointed out.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But critics cast doubt on whether his words meant an actual change of approach.It was shortly after 10am on Monday that Downing Street announced Mr Javid would take charge of the Home Office from Ms Rudd, who quit amid a row about deportation targets and the Windrush scandal.Critics claim both issues are underpinned by the single-minded drive to create a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants in the UK – instigated by Ms May when she was home secretary.Theresa May admits there were deportation targets when she was home secretaryWith Mr Javid forced to confront anger over the “hostile environment” approach in the Commons by 4pm, he said: “I don’t like the phrase hostile.“So the terminology I think is incorrect and I think it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it doesn’t represent our values as a country.”I don’t like the phrase hostile. So the terminology I think is incorrect and I think it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it doesn’t represent our values as a countryBefore quitting, Ms Rudd was reported to have been livid that she was dealing with the fallout of a broad approach to immigration implemented by Ms May.She was quick to tweet praise for Mr Javid’s opening comments on Monday, calling his appearance an “outstanding debut”.It will not have gone unnoticed in Downing Street that the new home secretary suggested language used by the prime minister for years does not reflect British “values”.He also risked provoking anger at Number 10 by saying he would review the use of “internal migration targets” at the Home Office, before deciding whether they should be kept – just hours after the prime minister gave an interview defending them.Boris Johnson clashes with Theresa May after demanding amnesty for all long-standing Commonwealth immigrantsMs May had said: “When I was home secretary we did have targets, targets for ensuring we were dealing with illegal immigrants.“I think if you ask any member of the public they will say that they do want government making sure that people who are here illegally are removed.”Asked whether Ms May wanted targets to continue at the Home Office later in the day, a Downing Street spokesman said it is up to the secretary of state to set “priorities”.It is not the first sign that Ms May’s Cabinet is challenging her long-established approach to immigration, with foreign secretary Boris Johnson recently reported to have called for an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have resided in the country for 10 years or more.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesSajid Javid outside the Home Office in Westminster after he was appointed as the new Home Secretary.

If you talk to members of the public, they want to be reassured that we are dealing with people who are here illegally.”The revelation will sharpen the focus on the role of the prime minister, the architect of the “hostile environment” policy that ended up persecuting the Windrush generation.Crucially, it is believed that any members of the Windrush generation detained for deportation – or prevented from returning to the UK – would have counted towards the now-revealed forced removal target.Jeremy Corbyn said: “Amber Rudd has been a human shield for Theresa May – and now she has gone.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

He added: “Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!”China is North Korea’s sole major ally, but trade has declined by about 90 per cent after Beijing implemented economic sanctions due to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.In March Mr Kim visited China by train, meeting Mr Xi and the pair – according to the state-run China Daily – agreed a plan to develop relations between the two countries, and to address the North’s nuclear programme.The 36-year-old dictator is anticipated to meet Mr Trump at some point in May or early June, though no date has been announced for the encounter the Republican accepted on the spur of the moment earlier this year.On Twitter Mr Trump suggested he was considering the Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, as the intended location. It is where last week’s summit between Mr Moon and Mr Kim was held.He tweeted: “Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace HouseFreedom House, on the Border of North \u0026amp South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country?

Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang quickly matched the South’s action with its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. Seoul’s announcement came a day after it said Mr Kim had told Mr Moon during the summit that he would shut down his country’s only known nuclear testing site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We are going to hopefully make a deal,” he told reporters.Mr Trump added he would maintain pressure on the North not to “repeat the mistakes of past administrations”.Korea Summit: Kim Jong-un crosses border for historic meetingKorea Summit: Kim Jong-un crosses border for historic meetingNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in raise their hands after signing on a joint statement Kim Jong-un heads towards Moon Jae-in to shake his hand between the military demarcation line, at the Joint Security Area on the Demilitarized Zone in the border village of Panmunjom in PajuSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un hold hands as they cross the military demarcation lineSouth Koreans react while watching a screen reporting the Inter Korean SummitSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un chat as they arrive at the Peace HouseNorth Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un was escorted by bodyguards from the North to the Military Demarcation Line that ides the two Koreas to meet with his South Korean counterpart at the truce village North Korean leader Kim Jong-un crosses the military demarcation line to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-inKim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in shake handsNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in shake hands after Kim crossing the military demarcation lineSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the Joint Security AreaSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un speak with two South Korean children who presented Kim Jong-un with a bouquet of flowersMoon Jae-in Kim Jong-un pose for photographers at the Joint Security Area (JSA)North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signs the guest book as South Korean President Moon Jae-in looks onNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s entry in the guestbook.

That is not letting parliament have it\u0026rsquos say. The truth is if we want parliament to have a truly meaningful vote we have to insist on it.\u0026ldquoThat is what this new clause is about.A total of 335 Lords backed the amendment while 244 voted against it.                \u0026lsquoMost DANGEROUS day for Brexit\u0026rsquo: Lords to block \u0026lsquono deal\u0027                Rees-Mogg\u0027s brilliant message to Peers attempting to thwart BrexitMrs May\u0027s spokesman has criticised the moveMrs May\u0026rsquos spokesman said prior to the vote: The withdrawal bill is about ensuring we leave the EU in a smooth and orderly manner.\u0026ldquoIt is not a mechanism for overturning the referendum.What this amendment would do is weaken the UK\u0027s hand in the Brexit negotiations by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything in regard to the negotiations, including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.The Government does not have a majority in the unelected Lords, and the amendment attracted support from cross-benchers and opposition MPs.Labour\u0027s Keir Starmer called the amendment one of the most important in the Brexit processMrs May\u0026rsquos difficulties are compounded by the fact that she has a wafer-thin majority in the Commons and relies on support from Unionist MPs in Northern Ireland.This means it would only take a small Tory rebellion to throw a ner in the works, especially as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has signalled his support for remaining in a customs union with the EU.The government has committed to giving parliament a vote on the final deal, but has framed this as a choice of whether to accept the terms it has negotiated with Brussels or reject them and leave without a deal.Brexit Secretary David Davis said prior to the vote: \u0026ldquoThe Government represents the country in international negotiations, not Parliament.The Tory frontbencher added: \u0026ldquoThere is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.Speaking specifically about the amendment, he said: \u0026ldquoAt best it undermines the government\u0026rsquos ability to reach a good deal with the EU.\u0026ldquoAt worst, it could reverse the British people\u0026rsquos decision and keep us in the EU.Brexit secretary said the Lords were undermining the government\u0026rsquos ability to reach a good dealLord Callanan, the Tory Brexit Minister in the House of Lords, added: This flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from Government to Parliament.It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the \u0026lsquono Brexit\u0026rsquo amendment.Hours later Lords approved a second amendment, tabled by Lord Monks,\u0026nbspwhich would require ministers to seek parliamentary approval for their phase two negotiating mandate, by 270 votes to 233.Tweeting about last night\u0027s \u0027No Deal\u0027 block, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote: Labour and Lib Dem peers vote to give themselves a veto on Brexit.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s patronising rubbish.It’s no surprise that this latest rebellion is being led by the Lib Dems, a party whose anti-Brexit platform was so popular at the last election that they managed to win 12 seats — just under 2 per cent of the Commons.Hardly shocking then that they’re no fans of democracy.What they’re doing is downright dangerous, and not just because a trolling guide produced by one Remoaning pressure group ominously promises “direct action”.The risk is that they put up enough barriers to our departure that the Government ends up compromising on membership of the customs union.That would be a knife in the heart of Global Britain and mean that Brussels bureaucrats would still be setting the rules.That simply cannot happen.The Prime Minister must stand firm.THE tragic death of Alfie Evans has touched the nation.There are real questions to be asked about who has the final say on treatment for terminally-ill children.But for now those debates should be put to one side.Our hearts go out to his parents who have fought so hard to give their son a chance.We also want to offer a tribute to the NHS staff who did all they could for him.And who will do the same, again and again, for hundreds of kids in the future.MO Salah is one of those sportsmen that you just want to succeed.But he’s proved himself much more than just a footballer.He’s broken down walls between different communities and has given back to those in his home town who weren’t blessed with such a cultured left foot.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we will be giving Parliament a vote on the final deal when we have concluded our negotiations with the EU.When all is said and done, I’m a Parliamentarian before a Minister, and a democrat before a Conservative.But there is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.The amendment Labour have proposed today in the House of Lords is at risk of doing just that.There are three crucial reasons why the Government could never accept it.Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for Parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical — because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give Parliament the power to micromanage the Government on how to carry out these negotiations.This would give the EU Commission a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions until the deadline has passed and the Government is stripped of its ability to negotiate freely.This fundamental change to the balance of our constitution would be both unprecedented and unworkable.And in our negotiations with the EU to date, the progress we have made has in part been down to the flexibility that both sides have shown.Imagine if every quick decision, proposal or response the Prime Minister and I have to take instead had to be timetabled, debated and voted on by over a thousand MPs and peers?Finally, the amendment proposes giving Parliament the power to direct the Government on anything relating to the negotiations – including extending the negotiation process and keeping the UK in the EU indefinitely.Sure, the peers proposing it may claim it is about keeping power in Parliament or ensuring their votes are ‘meaningful’.But those who want to overturn the result of the Referendum have been calling for a ‘no Brexit option’ for months, and this amendment would grant it to them.This is not what the British people want, and it is not something that we can accept. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As part of the feature a photofit was released of a man seen at the NAAFI on the day Katrice disappeared, holding a child similar to Katrice and getting into a green saloon car. We are keen to hear from anyone who could help to identify this person.A green saloon car was also seen on the River Alme Bridge near the NAAFI the day after Katrice disappeared. It may or may not be the same car, but we are very keen to identify this car.The investigation team would also like to hear from anyone who was living in the Paderborn area who owned a green saloon car in 1981, so that they can be ruled out of the teams enquiries.Officer OLeary said: Thirty six years have passed and allegiances may have changed.We are appealing to members of the public and the military community, including veterans and retired civil servants in both Germany and the UK - do you know what happened to Katrice?She had been shopping for her second birthday tea treats with her mum Sharon at the Schloss Neuhaus NAAFI supermarket when she disappeared.The case, which has chilling similarities to season two of BBC drama The Missing, remains unsolved.Sharon, now 64, said the toddler was “gone in a matter of seconds”. She added: “It’s living a nightmare that you never wake up from.“Nearly 37 years ago we became members of an exclusive club we didn’t ask for membership of — we became parents of a missing daughter. I would dearly love to be able to revoke that membership.Fighting back tears, Sharon told The Sun: “Although I would like a fairytale ending to our story, I fully appreciate that might not be.“But at the end of the day, we will have closure and any emotions that come from that closure we will learn to live with and deal with as we have for the past nearly 37 years.“The next five weeks is a double-edged sword for us as a family. We desperately want Katrice to be found but we also know that if anything is discovered during this search then my daughter’s life would have been ended in very unsavoury circumstances.“That’s another emotion we have to learn to live with.”Katrice’s dad Staff Sergeant Richard Lee, of the King’s Royal Hussars, was posted in West Germany at the height of the Cold War.On November 28, 1981, the NAAFI was rammed on the last payday before Christmas. Sharon said: “If you wanted English goodies, that was the time to get them.Katrice wouldn’t sit in the trolley, so I carried her all the way around in my arms doing my shopping.“When we got to the checkout I realised I’d forgotten crisps.“I put Katrice down and said to my sister Wendy, ‘Just keep an eye on her while I go back to the crisps stand’. It wasn’t far away. It took me about 40 seconds, a minute at most. When I got back I asked, ‘Where’s Katrice?’.“My sister said, ‘I thought she was with you. She ran and followed you’.“I went back down the aisle and she wasn’t there. Panic started to set in. I couldn’t see her anywhere. There was so many people. I was calling her name. Katrice couldn’t be found — she wasn’t there.”The Royal Military Police and German cops worked on the assumption the little girl — wearing red wellies, a turquoise duffle coat and tartan dress — wandered off, fell into another nearby river, the flooded Lippe, and drowned. But a hunt proved fruitless.Statements from shop staff were not taken for six weeks and details of an eye condition Katrice had were not released.The case was reopened in 2000 and led to the arrest of a former soldier. But he was released without charge and the case closed again after three years. There were further inquiries in 2012.Sharon, of Gosport, Hants, now divorced from Richard, is convinced Katrice was abducted. She said: “It’s my belief she left the NAAFI shop that morning, but she didn’t leave alone. I can’t believe — the NAAFI was so busy that morning — that a two-year-old walked out and disappeared off the face of the Earth and no one saw what happened.“I still have to go out and face the world and go about a daily routine but this situation never leaves you.“You can’t live with it 24/7. You have to push it to the back of your mind.

He said: “Hopefully, we can resolve issues and find out where my daughter is.”As cops appeal again for information to help solve the case, Sharon added: “If people put themselves in my shoes for five minutes and feel how we have lived and felt for the past 36 years, then maybe those feelings would get them to come forward.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger”.In a declaration that will sound alarm in Downing Street, Mr Javid was also swift to rubbish the ‘hostile environment’ mantra, a phrase used by Theresa May herself just last week.Instead, he would refer to policies to make it harder for illegal immigrants to prosper here as “compliant environment”, telling MPs: “I don’t like the phrase hostile. It’s not a phrase I’m going to use. It doesn’t represent the values of our country”.And hinting he is ready to make major changes to introduce a more liberal immigration policy, Mr Javid added: “It’s not just about a personnel change. It’s about action, and that’s why she’ll be seeing from my department”.But he said he is yet to decide on whether to continue with deportation targets, the controversial issue that Ms Rudd had to resign over after inadvertently misleading the Commons when she said last week they didn’t exist.Mr Javid immediately won the praise of his predecessor Ms Rudd, who tweeted: Outstanding debut by fantastic Sajid Javid in House of Commons today.But he risked angering his ageing mother by admitting he was yet to call her, but pledged: “I will do later”.Mr Javid’s elevation now makes him the boss of his younger brother Bas, who is a Chief Superintendent with West Midlands Police.Mr Javid has already ran for the Tory leadership once, on a joint ticket with Stephen Crabb against Theresa May in 2016. But they were eliminated in the first round of voting.Ms Rudd’s Cabinet exit has slashed the number of women around Theresa May’s top table down to just 22% in a blow for one of her own personal goals.Just five out of the Cabinets 23 full members are now women, after the PM failed to replace the outgoing Home Secretary with another woman.A further four female ministers are allowed to attend Cabinet.Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt took over Rudd’s Women and Equalities brief yesterday in addition to her aid responsibilities. Despite it being just day one on the job, Mr Javid was bombarded with calls from many quarters to reform the government’s creaking immigration policy.He also inherits a huge in tray, from also drawing up tough new terrorism laws to conquering rising gun and knife crime, and devising a new post-Brexit immigration system for EU citizens. Yesterday MEPs gave the new Home Secretary one of his first headaches in office as they voiced concerns over the registration process for EU citizens.In a letter to Mr Javid, the EU parliament’s Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt laid out a series of demands for the settled status scheme.MEPs also want applications to be cleared within 48 hours, with those who don’t receive a response within that time presumed to have been successful.Finally, in a sign of how low trust in the Home Office has sunk, the Parliament demanded to see evidence of how it will finance the scheme.The letter follows a presentation by Home Office officials in Brussels last week at which it emerged their flagship registration app doesn’t work properly on iPhones.Through hard graft and natural wit, he has gone from growing up on Britain’s most crime ridden street to the Home Office’s HQ on Marsham Street.On Bristol’s notorious Stapleton Road, he shared a cramped two bedroom flat with his parents and FOUR brothers until the age of 12.It was opposite a brothel, and a prostitute used to stand outside.“I didn’t know what a prostitute was at the time,” Sajid told me during the 2015 general election campaign. “For me, it was home”.Both parents were first generation Brits, immigrating from the Punjab in Pakistan – his father with just £1 in his pocket when he arrived.Dad Abdul eventually escaped the Rochdale cotton mill to realise his ambition of becoming a bus driver, before achieving his next one of owning his own clothes shop with a family move down south to Bristol.A childhood highlight for Sajid came twice a year when, as a special treat, the boys’ father would rent a VHS player for a weekend and leave them to binge on all the latest movies, until it went back to the shop on Monday.From being able to speak only Punjabi when he first went to nursery aged three, Sajid won a place at Exeter University.From there, he went into the City and made millions, becoming the youngest ever vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank aged just 25.All his success he attributes to his mum and dad.The MP for Bromsgrove still lives by his father’s favourite mantra.“You get back what you put in, my dad would often say,” he also told me.It was the Falklands War two years on that “awoke my patriotism”, he said.“I wouldn’t miss a single night of the TV news and I bought all the newspapers, I had to follow every turn.”Sajid’s proud father saw his son elected to Parliament in 2010, but died of cancer a year later, and didn’t witness his elevation to the government as a junior Treasury minister in 2012, having caught the keen eye of then Chancellor George Osborne.He entered the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in 2014, going on to serve as Business Secretary in 2015, and Housing Secretary in 2016.A father of three himself now, the 48-year-old appears far from finished yet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If this means London swings to Labour, then it’s also likely to mean much of the rest of England will swing to Conservative.”He added: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even those they have lost more seats in London.”The Strathcylde University Professor – Britain’s most famous so-called psephologist – received a knighthood in the Queen’s 2018 New Year’s honours list.He has accurately predicted the last four general elections, including last June’s surprise results where he correctly said the Conservatives would lose their majority.The forecast came as separate research claimed voters were “anxious” about the state of the country – led by fury over the housing crisis.Deborah Mattinson at Britain Thinks added that young 18-30 voters were “more gloomy than older voters” and felt a “strong sense of injustice”.She said: “Seven out of ten no longer think it pays to work hard.”Some 4,410 seats are being contested on Thursday across 150 councils. Just over 40 per cent are in London.Sir John said: “Because London accounts for 42 per cent of seats, there is a risk that the headline tally of seats won or lost will be misleading.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is taking Lexlaw to a tribunal alleging constructive dismissal, but is said to be “entirely sanguine” about airing details of his kinky activities.Sources close to Mr Jones insist the spanking was consensual and the couple did not have sex.But he is said to be keen to protect the “very junior employee” involved in a tryst that sent rumbles through London’s stuffy Inns of Court.Mr Jones told legal blog RollOnFriday that he was suspended last June just a day after he rejected a request from Lexlaw’s managing director to reconsider his resignation amid a salary dispute.The lawyer said the spanking session had happened long before he quit and claimed it was only raised so Lexlaw would not have to pay him for his notice period.Mr Jones studied at Cambridge from 1996 to 2000, gaining a first-class degree in mathematics and a special prize in astrophysics before studying law. He joined Lexlaw in October 2012 and specialised in corporate finance, before leaving last year to become a freelance barrister.On the row, Mr Jones said: “I had a consensual BDSM relationship with another employee, which included one brief incident in private on work premises several months before the disciplinary proceedings.“I was appalled to find out that my employer was monitoring my personal communications over a period of at least several months.”He claims the disciplinary action was in “retaliation” for him handing in his notice and “not a result of the much earlier incident”.A spokesman for Lexlaw confirmed “inappropriate workplace activities” had taken place last year involving a senior barrister.They declined to comment further other than to say: “The activities that took place are as unacceptable in our workplace as they would no doubt be in any workplace.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It stated: “This is very effective.

Overall, women were at greatest risk if they scoffed large amounts of rice and pasta.The study of 14,000 people found carb-lovers were affected nearly five years earlier than those who ate plenty of oily fish and beans.The average age at menopause in the UK is 51.But experts found diet affects when women go through the change.Vegetarians went through menopause around 10 months earlier than meat-eaters. Scientists claim animal fats raise levels of the hormone oestrogen, which may impact fertility.Eating oily fish and beans was also found to delay the menopause by more than three years, thanks to their high levels of antioxidants.It includes servings of salmon, mackerel and sardines.But insulin spikes triggered by consumption of refined carbohydrates like pasta are believed to speed up a woman’s periods and earlier menopause.Researcher Professor Janet Cade, from the School of Food Science and Nutrition at Leeds University, said: The age at which menopause begins can have serious health implications for some women.A clear understanding of how diet affects the start of natural menopause will be very beneficial to those who may already be at risk or have a family history of certain complications related to menopause. A higher intake of vitamin B6 and zinc also appeared to delay the onset.Women who suffer later menopause are more likely to develop breast, womb, and ovarian cancers. The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, followed 14,172 Brit women for four years.More than 900 experienced the start of menopause during the research.Lead author Yashvee Dunneram, of the School of Food Science and Nutrition, said: This study is the first to investigate the links between individual nutrients and a wide variety of food groups and age at natural menopause in a large cohort of British women.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But then I couldn’t have imagined the abuse the elephants suffer.“Now I know, and I think everyone else needs to see this and know too.”Arthur is one of 50 elephants kept in pain and terror at an “elephant temple” in Guruvayur, in Kerala, South India.It is a popular destination for thousands of the more than 850,000 Brits who visit India each year.Evanna, who is also an avid animal rights campaigner, continued: “I have been so shocked. We saw one elephant chained up — it couldn’t move at all.“It had a stick resting on its head so if it moved the stick would fall. If it did the trainer would give it a beating.“I asked the man standing there how long the elephant might have been there, and he told me probably his whole life. That is unfathomable.”India’s elephants are snatched from their mothers in the wild when they are babies and taken to secret “training camps”. Here they are beaten, starved and tortured into complete submission in a process called “pajan”.The first step is for the beasts to be forced into a kraal or “crushing cage”.This is a wooden structure designed to keep the elephant so tightly caged it cannot move — not even to turn around, nod its head or sit down.Trainers then starve the animal and keep it awake for days on end.Exhausted and on the brink of death, the elephants are then beaten with wooden weapons, specially designed to inflict as much pain as possible.This happens every day for at least six months, but can go on for years.When finally their spirit is so broken that they let their trainers ride them, they are deemed safe enough to be rented out or sold to tourist attractions and temples across India.Nearly half of the elephants die from this abuse, and of those who survive to be sold, another ten per cent die within a year due to stress. But their suffering is a tourism goldmine.Elephants can be rented out for rides, festivals or to temples for anything from £34 to £1,600 a day — in a country where the average labourer only makes £10 a day.While much of the most violent training takes place out of sight of tourists, the brutal reality of elephants’ lives is far from hidden.When we arrive at Kerala’s Kochi airport a giant elephant statue welcomes us, complete with chains around its feet.Within half an hour of being on the road we are overtaken on a motorway by a rusty truck carrying an elephant tied down by chains, wires and rope. Seconds later another passes.They are being transported from camps across the country to one of India’s famous elephant festivals, Thrissur Pooram, in Thrissur, Kerala.We are on our way to the same event, where we find more than 90 elephants have been shipped in. They are dressed up and forced to stand in front of huge crowds while cannons fire and drums are banged for hours.With the help of our guide we gain access to a backstage holding pen for the animals, out of sight of visitors.In this dark, corrugated-iron structure the animals are heavily chained, unable to move or access water. Each has at least one trainer guarding it with sticks, and every animal looks terrified.Many have gaping wounds on their feet and backs — not a problem for the trainers who simply paint the wounds grey to cover up the injuries from the tourists.In order to discover more about what these beasts have been through, Evanna and I travel two hours north into deep forest to the village of Kodanad, where our guide tells us there is a training camp. After some careful negotiations with guards we manage to enter, posing as tourists who “just want to see the elephants”. Inside we see the terrible, stark reality of their lives.Chained to tree stumps, they are in appalling condition.Autoor is 16 years old and we find her swaying her head from side to side, over and over again — a sign of huge distress.It is impossible not to want to comfort her, but before we get too close a trainer approaches and whacks her with a stick, she immediately stops swaying, instead standing completely still.We quickly move on until we find a clearing in the forest. It is here we find the saddest of sights — a lone elephant locked in a crushing cage.The wooden cell stands so tall at first it is almost impossible to make out the elephant stuck inside.Then the trainers arrive and begin hitting and stabbing the elephant through the cage with large sticks.It is too much to bear and, with our guide getting increasingly anxious about our pictures being discovered, we quickly leave.I ask our guide, is this how all elephants are trained, or are some tamed more humanely?His response is chilling: “This is every single tourist elephant’s fate. The only reason they obey is with fear. They have been broken.”Duncan McNair, founder of charity Save The Asian Elephants (STAE) is campaigning for a law banning UK holiday firms and tour companies advertising trips for these sorts of encounters with animals.He says: “Elephants are some of the most intelligent, emotional creatures in the world and the abuse they suffer is unimaginable.“Those horrors ensure the rest of their life is lived in fear.“I’m confident that if any tourist ever saw this, or even a small aspect of it, they would be appalled.”With tears in her eyes, Evanna said: “When people who have ridden elephants in the past or visited these places see this article, I don’t want them to feel guilty — they were misled by the irresponsible tourist industry.“What we need to do is to put that guilt into action and not visit these places in future.“I’d read a lot about the abuse elephants suffer but seeing it up close has given me the ability to speak from my heart and tell others that we can make a change by not spending our money and posting these tourist images.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added: “This my Lords is a wrecker’s amendment. And I wish it ill.”Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts sparked uproar in the chamber by comparing the proposed Bill to something out of Nazi Germany.He said: “My mind went back to Berlin in March 1933, when the Enabling Bill was passed in the Reichstag.That transferred democratic rights of the parliament into the hands of one man. His name was Adolf Hitler.”Brexit Minister Steve Baker slammed the “disgraceful, irresponsible rhetoric”.Lib Dem peers said they were “in the driving seat” over Brexit. Lord Newby added it was “vital that Parliament, not the Government, decides whether or not any Brexit deal is acceptable”.MPs will now vote on the amendment.

Evidence from health groups found that US companies are “particularly keen to gain access to the public health systems of Europe”.The International Trade committee recommends working across parties to achieve political consensus on its post-Brexit trade policy because trade deals are likely to take years to negotiate and could involve governments led by different parties over the coming years.SNP MP and chair of the International Trade committee Angus MacNeil said: “It would be a catastrophic error to rush into negotiations with the US without a comprehensive trade strategy.“The economic benefits of a US deal are presently unproven. The Government appears to be engaged in an exercise in doublethink: on the one hand telling us that new trade deals will be the pot of gold at the end of the Brexit rainbow, while simultaneously saying it’s too soon to offer a realistic estimate of the possible contents or benefits a deal with its highest-priority target.”“Even in ideal circumstances, trade-offs will have to be made to get a comprehensive US deal. Without a trade strategy, we have no idea what these may be. Will the Government, in their rush to secure the future of the UK services sector, sacrifice UK agriculture or manufacturing? What does the Government intend to do to help industries if they are negatively affected by this bargain?“It was clear in our inquiry that questions about trade with the EU and with the US cannot be answered in isolation. Will the UK align its regulations with the US, and risk erecting impenetrable trade barriers with our other global partners, particularly the EU?If there is a clash between the regulatory regimes of the EU and the US, which does the Government plan to prioritise? These issues need to be worked out, not just before negotiating a deal with the US, but also before we finalise our future trading relationship with the EU.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I want to die. It’s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.“If one chooses to kill oneself, then that should be fair enough. I don’t think anyone else should interfere.”Dr Goodall told Seven News: My feeling is that an old person like myself should have full citizenship rights including the right of assisted suicide.Controversial euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke said his organisation, Exit International, was assisting Professor Goodall to travel business class to the clinic.Dr Goodall has been a member of the group for almost 20 years and will fly out of Perth on Wednesday.One of the organisations nurses, Carol O’Neil, will accompany him to the Life Circle in Basel, Switzerland, which has been able to fast track him.Exit International started a GoFundMe campaign, which had raised more than $18,5000 by Tuesday.Dr Nitschke, who burnt his practising certificate in 2015 to protest against Medical Board conditions on his registration, said it was a shame Dr Goodall had to undertake an arduous trip to have a peaceful death at the time of his choosing.The centenarian made international headlines in 2016 when his university reversed a decision to kick him out of his office on campus amid concerns his long public transport commute was a health risk.Considered a leading botanist and ecologist, Prof Goodall was born in Edmonton, London, in 1914.He received his PhD from the Imperial College of Science and Technology in the capital in 1941 before emigrating to Australia in 1948, where took up a post at the University of Melbourne.David was awarded a Doctor of Science from Melbourne University as well as an honorary doctorate from the Università degli Studí di Trieste  in Italy.

But the application was eventually successful.Mr Brokenshire’s appointment as the new Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government comes just weeks after he had a cancerous tumour removed from his right lung.He quit as Northern Ireland Secretary in January ahead of the surgery.His embarrassing nimbyism came as housing groups piled on the pressure for Mr Brokenshire to get a grip of the “biggest housing emergency in decades”.Housing charity Shelter said: “With the lowest levels of social housebuilding since the second world war and rough sleeping is its highest for a decade, we hope the new Secretary of State will take the bold action needed to fix our broken housing market.
