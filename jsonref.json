She turned it down and re-signed with Sony but went on to give Tidal exclusive rights to her latest album, Lemonade, which can only be streamed on Tidal.’Directly addressing the recent allegations surrounding Tidal supposedly manipulating streaming figures, including that of Beyonce’s hit album, our source added:‘Jay has now been accused of falsifying data to make it seem as if it was played more times than it was. He’s appalled by the claim and believes the story is being pushed by people who feel slighted by Bey’s decision to choose his business over theirs.’It comes just after the Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv reported that the streaming service falsified and inflated streaming numbers for Kanye’s The Life of Pablo and Beyoncé’s Lemonade albums in 2016.It comes just after a Norwegian newspaper, Dagens Næringsliv, published a report in which it claims a study has found evidence Tidal figures were ‘manipulate’  (Picture: SONYLemonade)The disputed numbers in question were that The Life of Pablo achieved 250 million streams in 10 days, and that Lemonade clocked-up 306 million streams within 15 days.What make this interesting is the fact that Tidal’s service is believed to have had three million subscribers in total across its user base in March of 2016 (which was touted in a press release that year), however, the newspaper published an article in January of this year claiming that it had evidence showing internal figures were well-below this.The publication instead states that an internal report reveals the streaming service only made payments to record labels for around 850,000 users.Now, after enlisting the help of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s Centre for Cyber and Information Security to investigate data that the paper said it got from a hard drive handed in to them, an investigation has supposedly found a manipulation must have occurred.Responding to the allegations made by the paper using the study, Tidal released the following statement to Music Business Worldwide:Apple\u0027s iOS 11.3 is causing nasty problems with some people\u0027s iPhonesApple is apparently planning to bring back a feature missing from latest iPhonesApple has a secret base in the UK that\u0027s working on futuristic confidential technology‘This is a smear campaign from a publication that once referred to our employee as an “Israeli Intelligence officer” and our owner as a “crack dealer.” We expect nothing less from them than this ridiculous story, lies and falsehoods.

She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.

Meghan and Harry have invited hundreds of school children to the wedding of the yearWhen the couple went to Leonora\u0027s school in December, Ms Markle made a promise to return for a private visit.Ms Markle honoured her promise and returned to the school for a private visit earlier this year and spent some time with Leonora giving her acting tips.Palace officials then contacted Leonora and the school\u0027s deputy principal that they have two tickets and will be attending the wedding last month. Leonora says she already has her dress ready for the wedding and will be going along with deputy principal Helen Foulger. Leonora said: \u0027When I found out that I was invited to the wedding, I was speechless. I am so excited. \u0027When my mum was told I was invited she screamed for five minutes.\u0027Meghan is such an inspiration to me - the first time I met her I asked her if she had any advice for me as I want to be an actress like her.¿It¿ll be a special day for everybody¿: Prince Charles and...The royals as you¿ve never seen them before: Amateur snaps...Share this article\u0027She said I should always be prepared to face rejection but to keep following my dreams.

This is her highest ever achievement. \u0027She is desperate to be an actress and so she was so thrilled to meet Meghan. \u0027But we\u0027ve had to keep our lips sealed on the details as it is so highly classified.\u0027     Leonora, left, is pictured on the day of the royal visit alongside her fellow pupils and former Apprentice candidate Elizabeth McKenna          Meghan spoke to Leonora and promised her a private visit to the academy, which she honoured earlier this year          A Household Cavalry troop of Life Guards leaves the barracks as they prepare for the royal wedding          The Manchester survivorSchoolgirl Amelia Thompson (right with her mother Lisa) , who was caught up in the Manchester Arena suicide bombing last year, has found herself on the guest list.And in a touching gesture, the 12-year-old is planning to take a grandmother who lost a loved one in last year\u0027s terrorist attack.The youngster, from Dronfield Woodhouse, near Sheffield, has spent a year recovering from the trauma she suffered after she witnessed the aftermath of the bombing.But the invitation has helped to lift her spirits - indeed, Amelia said she was \u0027speechless\u0027 when she saw the message saying she was going to the wedding.She said she was \u0027so excited\u0027 she could not respond, and is already planning to buy a dress for the occasion.Movingly, she has decided to give her other ticket to grandmother Sharon Goodman, whose 15-year-old granddaughter Olivia Campbell-Hardy died in the attack.The homeless teenager          Kai Fletcher (right) had a difficult childhood growing up in a household troubled by alcohol and domestic violence, and found himself homeless at the age of just 15.After turning to Bath-based charity Southside for help, the 18-year-old now works for the organisation as a young advocate team leader having turned his life around.\u0027It was a bit surprising. I am looking forward to going, really excited,\u0027 he said of his invitation.Mr Fletcher, who lives in Bath, said he would be taking his sister Louise with him to the wedding at Windsor Castle next month.He said he said: \u0027I am giving back to Southside what they have given to me, which was a new opportunity.\u0027The rallying Royal Marine          A former Royal Marine\u0027s love of rally cars led to him leading a charity helping ex-service personnel and has now seen him invited to the royal wedding.Grant White, 52, (right) spent 23 years as a commando, leaving in 2008 as a warrant officer after being medically discharged, and is now head of operations for the Race2Recovery charity.The charity, which runs an off-road team that has competed in the Dakar Rally, provides opportunities in motorsport for people who have suffered life-changing injuries.Mr White, who lost his right leg below the knee in a hit-and-run road accident, said: \u0027It was a very pleasant surprise and it caught me slightly off-guard, I must admit.\u0027It is a fantastic opportunity and a great occasion.\u0027 He has not met Prince Harry personally but has met other royals during his long military career.Mr White, who lives in Dorset but is originally from Leicester, started out as a beneficiary of Race2Recovery because of a keen interest in motorsport before working for the charity.\u0027The priority will always be wounded, injured and sick service personnel,\u0027 he said.\u0027The big area we are hitting on now is mental health and we are getting a lot of PTSD. In the old days it was all amputees, people like me, and wheelchair users. I am now trying to push people\u0027s mental boundaries.\u0027  The deaf teenage campaigner          Fourteen-year-old Reuben Litherland\u0027s school support worker in Derby did not believe him at first when he informed her he would be among the congregation at the wedding, his mother said.The Saint Benedict Catholic Academy pupil (right), who is deaf and has set up a lunchtime sign language club at school, is still coming to terms with the news, she said.Jacinta Litherland, who will attend the wedding with her son, said: \u0027He is very excited, and probably a bit bewildered. It\u0027s just not quite sunk in.\u0027She said she was \u0027very proud\u0027 of her son\u0027s achievements, which include campaigning for deaf friendly cinema screenings, at such a young age.\u0027He is raising awareness of the difficulties and struggles that deaf children face, and he\u0027s doing it very well,\u0027 she said. The charitable entrepreneur          \u0027Miss Macaroon\u0027 Rosie Ginday, 34, (right) earned her invitation after Harry and Meghan were blown away by her Birmingham social enterprise and baking business on a visit to the city earlier this year.Set up in 2011, her sweet treats organisation reinvests profits into developing disadvantaged young people\u0027s potential, training them as chefs, and offering them real world experience.And the royal couple got the chance to sample some of her trainees\u0027 macaroons during their visit in March.The qualified pastry chef and former English teacher said: \u0027Harry and Meghan came to Millennium Point (Birmingham), and got to taste our macaroons which was really fun.\u0027They were both so passionate about meeting all the young girls there and took a real interest.\u0027They\u0027re accessible as well, and it\u0027s great to have a younger generation of royals showing they do care and they are invested in what young people can do.\u0027Ms Ginday\u0027s organisation has worked with care-leavers, the homeless, lone single parents and those with mental health problems, introducing them to working life, at the firm\u0027s shop and bakery, and even giving some the chance to work at Michelin star restaurant Purnell\u0027s.The inspiring primary school teacher          David Gregory (right) will be will be celebrating his first wedding anniversary on the same weekend as the royal wedding.Fortunately, though, the 28-year-old from Blyth, Northumberland, is taking wife Hannah to enjoy the festivities in the grounds of Windsor Castle on May 19.The pair married on May 20 last year and Mr Gregory described the invitation as the \u0027perfect\u0027 way to mark their own milestone.Mr Gregory, who teaches Year 4 at Newsham Primary School in Blyth, said : \u0027My mam wanted to go, the headteacher wanted to go, but the only thing that was ever going to happen was for me and my wife to head down.\u0027He will be wearing his own wedding suit for the occasion, but joked that his 26-year-old wife is stopping short of turning up in her wedding gown.\u0027We\u0027d always planned on celebrating our one-year anniversary as you\u0027d expect, but I don\u0027t think it could have been any more perfect,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m planning on going in very formal attire. I felt very comfortable and happy in my wedding suit so I think that\u0027s the right way to go.\u0027Obviously we thought about Hannah wearing her wedding dress as well but we\u0027re not going to try and steal any limelight.\u0027Mr Gregory, who was put forward for an invitation by the Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, was singled out for his work strengthening and celebrating his local community in Blyth.His recycling initiative with pupils won a Love Northumberland award, and he is a driving force behind the Port of Blyth\u0027s STEM hub, designed to encourage pupils\u0027 engagement with STEM subjects, and inspire their future careers.The youngsters in his school have yet to find out about his invite because they are on holiday.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to tell them. We\u0027re looking at how we can make this really relevant and real to the children,\u0027 Mr Gregory said.He is, however, planning to record a video diary of his experience on the day for them.   The Welsh charity worker          Zoe Ardunell (above) will be lucky enough to see the couple for a second time, having met them during a recent visit to Cardiff Castle.The 20-year-old from Penygraig in Wales described that as \u0027a very happy day\u0027 and said Harry told her she was \u0027definitely a role model\u0027 for her work with the Valley Kids charity which helps disadvantaged children and families.She will take as her guest her 62-year-old grandmother Pat Churches, who she said \u0027loves the royals\u0027.Ms Arundell said she was relieved to see she had no plans that weekend, but quickly added: \u0027I think if I did have any plans they would be changed straight away!\u0027 Schoolgirl born with one leg          A schoolgirl born with one leg who became a charity ambassador and mental health champion is now looking forward to buying a new dress.Jorja Furze, 12, (right) says she will go shopping with her mother, Gabrielle, 39, who will also accompany her on the day, for something to wear for the event.Describing her delight at receiving an email invitation last week, the schoolgirl said: \u0027I was really excited and shocked because I didn\u0027t think I would get an invite.\u0027I had been told my name had been mentioned to some people about the wedding, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get close to it.\u0027The youngster, who was born with only a right leg, is an ambassador for the Steel Bones charity which supports civilian amputees, added: \u0027They thought I would be a good candidate.\u0027I\u0027ve grown up without a leg and they thought having someone that younger children could relate to would be good.\u0027Jorja, from the village of Isleham near Ely, Cambridgeshire, has also set up a quiet space at her high school where children with mental health issues can relax.She said: \u0027Me and my friend both suffer from anxiety and mental health, we decided we should do something because we knew a lot of people had similar problems and we convinced the teacher to let us start this up.\u0027 The community lunchers          Tessa Hince (right), who lives near Banbury, Oxfordshire, and Hayley Ash, of Shipston-on-Stour, both 32, have been running the successful Shipston Christmas Community Lunch, since 2016.The community event brings together people who might otherwise be isolated at Christmas, drawing its funds and produce from public donations.Both had already got invitations to the Queen\u0027s garden party on May 15, and joked they now needed to find different outfits for the wedding.Miss Hince, who is taking along her best friend, said she was \u0027absolutely speechless\u0027 and \u0027so excited\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s giving some coverage to this great cause,\u0027 she added.Miss Ash, who is taking her mother as a guest, said: \u0027It\u0027s crazy - it all feels like a bit of a whirlwind.\u0027 The amputee campaigner          Ex-Royal Irish Regiment soldier Phillip Gillespie (right) says it is \u0027a wee bit surreal\u0027 to think he will be there next month with his girlfriend, Kirsty Crawford.The 30-year-old, who lost his right leg in Afghanistan in 2011, is also eagerly awaiting news as to whether he has made the rowing and archery teams for the next Invictus Games - a brainchild of Harry.Mr Gillespie, who is involved with ABF The Soldiers\u0027 Charity, said he was looking forward to a busy few months with the Invictus trial results, the wedding and then a royal garden party following his BEM award last year.He said he had not told many people yet but expected his friends\u0027 reaction to be muted, compared to the feedback his girlfriend was getting.\u0027I think Kirsty has got more of a reaction, I think it (a wedding) is more of a girl thing,\u0027 he laughed.He added: \u0027It\u0027s a massive privilege, it will be a huge spectacle.\u0027                                                      Revealed: The full schedule and timings of Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding from their arrival at Windsor Castle to a glitzy evening bashRoyal fans across the country have been waiting with bated breath for the full details of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.And finally Kensington Palace have released the full schedule and timings for the big day.Here we look at what we can expect on May 19, from when the first guests arrive at Windsor Castle to the evening celebrations at Frogmore House.The couple will spend, as according to tradition, the night before their wedding apart.There will be no American-style maid of honour and all of the couple\u0027s page boys and bridesmaids – who are expected to include Prince George and Princess Charlotte – will be children.The couple will not go on honeymoon straight away – and will, remarkably, undertake their first public engagement as man and wife just days after the ceremony.

Mr Belhaj - a leading member of the Islamist opposition to Colonel Gaddafi - and his wife have offered to settle for a token £1 from each defendant and an apology for what they sufferedThe couple claim the UK was involved in \u0027arranging, assisting and encouraging their unlawful rendition\u0027.International human rights group Reprieve and the Belhaj family say their abduction was a direct result of a joint MI6-CIA operation following the \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 in which Tony Blair\u0027s government re-opened diplomatic links with Gaddafi.According to Reprieve, part of the deal involved the illegal kidnapping and flying of Libyan dissidents to Tripoli.They say cases came to light in 2011, when faxes written by Sir Mark, which described the rendition flights, were found in Libya\u0027s intelligence headquarters. Giving his judgment at the Supreme Court, Lord Mance said: \u0027They allege that they suffered mistreatment amounting to torture at the hands of US agents in Bangkok and in the airplane and at the hands of Libyan officials in Libya.\u0027The judge said the couple were relying on the letter supposedly written by Sir Mark to Mr Moussa Koussa, head of the Libyan External Security Organisation.\u0027The letter congratulated Mr Moussa Koussa on the safe arrival of (Mr Belhaj),\u0027 said the judge.\u0027It said that This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years.\u0027It indicated that British intelligence had led to Mr Belhaj\u0027s transfer to Libya, although the British services did not pay for the air cargo.\u0027 Government lawyers had argued that the Belhaj claims should be barred under state immunity.They said the foreign \u0027act of state\u0027 doctrine prohibits the courts of one country sitting in judgment on the acts of the government of another within its own territory.The High Court agreed with the Government\u0027s stance and ruled that the claims should be struck out.          Belhaj was allegedly transported to Libya and was tortured by forces of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi But Reprieve argued that the Government had already settled a related claim out of court by paying compensation to another family who were rendered to Libya in the same \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 conspiracy.The Court of Appeal then reversed the High Court ruling.It said the doctrine relied upon by the government might not apply to alleged breaches of international law or human rights obligations, even in cases involving the conduct of a foreign state.The appeal judges said there was a \u0027compelling public interest\u0027 in allegations of unlawful rendition and \u0027particularly grave violations of international law and human rights\u0027 being investigated by the English courts.UK Government lawyers then argued that the compensation claim could not be heard in a British court because it would damage relations with the US.But the argument was dismissed by the seven justices - court president Lord Neuberger, sitting with Lady Hale and Lords Mance, Clarke, Wilson, Sumption and Hughes. Lord Mance said that \u0027state immunity is no bar to the claims\u0027, and the defendants had not \u0027on the assumed facts shown any entitlement to rely on the doctrine of foreign act of state\u0027.He said: \u0027The appeals are dismissed and the cases may proceed to trial.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/15/4B5E85C500000578-0-image-m-53_1524322087001.jpg","title":"Customer confronts Subway worker makes confess BACON vegetarian

Serenity and good humour radiated from the Chair. There were no tantrums. There was no sucking up to any lobby or any VIP in the galleries. The occupant of the Chair did not, after each question, scratch furiously on his order paper with his ballpoint pen, as though expunging an imagined evil spot.The names of those MPs who were called to speak were barked out crisply and without mocking over-emphasis or mimicry of their accents. Everything felt blissfully unaffected and effortlessly objective. The Chair was the Chair and that was an end to the matter. All the ghastly self-esteem of Bercow had evaporated.The moment he leaves Speaker’s House for good, all his balefulness and bias will disperse like eggy gas on a breeze.By the end of PMQs, some MPs were cheering Sir Lindsay and calling for an encore. ‘More, more, more,’ they cried. Sir Lindsay looked mortified by this acclaim. He blushed.The Prime Minister bade Sir Lindsay a brief and apparently friendly adieu as she left the Chamber. Jeremy Corbyn went up to him a few minutes later and appeared to say well done to him, shaking his hand. The clerks looked happier.

There was no sitting back and letting the two main party leaders hog the time. Theresa May finds pithiness a challenge, to put it mildly. She’d be ace at Radio 4’s waffle contest ‘Just A Minute’ (though she might find the avoidance of repetition and deviation tricky).Some of her replies yesterday could have been at least half as long and would have benefited greatly from that, making her sound more decisive. But she was a little less long-winded than normal.

Sometimes his exchanges with Mrs May go on for more than 15 minutes. Yesterday they were completed in about ten. Much better.Not once did Sir Lindsay do that Bercow thing of upbraiding an MP by name, or making a foul gargling noise to indicate his displeasure. Not once did he try to tick off errant backbenchers by saying ‘go and lie down in a darkened room and take some soothing medicament, man’ (what weary tropes his interventions have become). Not once did he pour gloop on some MP whose birthday it happened to be, or someone who happened to have been an acquaintance of his since their days together in student politics. All these we were spared.When Rachel Maclean (Con, Redditch) was asking Mrs May a sycophantic question about the local elections, Sir Lindsay briefly muttered ‘let’s get on with it’. He also signalled to Mrs May’s pit-mechanics that she should stop being quite so windy. The rest of the time he maintained good order by little more than a raised hand (to quell some Tory heckling) and a disbelieving frown (to let Labour MPs know they were pushing their misbehaviour too far).A class act.

The plane carrying Pompeo and the three Americans - Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim - touched down on US soil in Anchorage, Alaska on Wednesday for a brief refueling stop before continuing on its journey to Washington, DC          Earlier on Wednesday, the US government plane on which Pompeo and the three newly freed men were traveling (left) landed at Yokota U.S. Airbase in the outskirts of Tokyo before refueling for the long haul back to North America  Two fire trucks are hoisting up a large American flag which will greet the freed detainees once they arrive at Joint Base Andrews sometime around 2:00am Eastern Standard Time          President Donald Trump tweeted late Wednesday that he was \u0027Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M.\u0027In a statement released by the State Department, the former detainees expressed their \u0027deep appreciation\u0027 to the US government, Trump, Pompeo and the American people \u0027for bringing us home.\u0027They are the latest in a series of Americans to be held in North Korea for alleged anti-state activities in recent years, only to be freed during the visit of a high-level US official or statesman. Their releases draw a line under an issue that had weighed on plans for a historic summit between Kim and Trump that will focus on North Korea\u0027s nuclear weapons.\u0027We\u0027re granting amnesty to the three detained Americans,\u0027 the North Korean emissary told Pompeo at Pyongyang\u0027s Koryo Hotel, according to the senior US official who requested anonymity to discuss the exchange. \u0027We issued the order to grant immediate amnesty to the detainees.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s great,\u0027 the secretary of state replied.The North Korean official then advised that the releases would follow a \u0027very brief ceremony\u0027 - which he described as more like a legal process. The official closed with a gentle warning for the U.S. to prevent a repeat: \u0027You should make care that they do not make the same mistakes again,\u0027 the official said. \u0027This was a hard decision.\u0027          U.S. citizen Kim Hak-song was detained \u0027on suspicion of acts against the state\u0027  Kim Dong-chul, pictured above, left and right, had been detained since 2015. He was arrested for spying and had been sentenced to 10 years\u0027 hard laborNorth Korea\u0027s official news agency, KCNA, said early Thursday that Kim \u0027accepted an official suggestion of the US president for the release of Americans who have been detained in the DPRK for their anti-DPRK hostilities,\u0027 referring to the initials of the authoritarian nation\u0027s official name, the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea. The dispatch also made the first official mention by the North of plans for the Trump-Kim summit.The Trump administration has made clear it regarded the arrests as politically motivated, and had been bitterly critical of North Korea\u0027s refusal to grant consular access to the three, other than a brief visit by a US envoy last June.           Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-Duk, was a Korean-American professor and aid worker before his arrestThe envoy had repatriated college student Otto Warmbier, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labor for stealing a propaganda poster. Warmbier died in June 2017, days after he arrived back in the US with severe brain damage.Since then, pressure to win the releases of the other three men, whom the administration has referred to as \u0027hostages,\u0027 has intensified.Relatively little is known about the men, all Korean-Americans, and the circumstances in which they ended up in North Korean custody.Kim Dong Chul, a former Virginia resident who had reportedly run a company on North Korea\u0027s border with Russia, had been sentenced in April 2016 to 10 years in prison with hard labor after being convicted of espionage. Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim, who had both taught at a university in Pyongyang that was founded with donations from Christian groups, had been held for about one year and apparently had not been tried.          President Trump triumphantly announced the release of the trio of Americans in his own style – with a pair of tweetsTony Kim\u0027s son Sol Kim, a graduate student in California, is the only relative of the detainees to have appealed in public for their freedom. On learning of the release of Tony, who also uses the name Kim Sang-duk, his family expressed gratitude and credited Trump for engaging directly with North Korea.\u0027We ... want to thank the President for engaging directly with N. Korea. Mostly, we thank God for Tony’s safe return,\u0027 they said.           On learning of the release of Tony, who also uses the name Kim Sang-duk, his family expressed gratitude and credited Trump for engaging directly with North KoreaThe family also called for prayers for \u0027the people of North Korea and for the release of all who are still being held.\u0027 Washington and Pyongyang have remained in a state of war since the fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War ended and do not have formal diplomatic ties, complicating efforts to handle the cases of American detainees. Typically, Swedish diplomats based in North Korea handle US consular affairs.Pompeo, the most senior US official to meet with a North Korean leader since 2000, was making his second visit to the isolated nation in five weeks - and less than two weeks after becoming top diplomat.           Before Wednesday, the only American released by North Korea during Trump’s presidency had been Otto Warmbier (above), a 22-year-old university student who returned to the US in a coma last summer after 17 months of captivity and died days laterSome in Washington had expressed disappointment that Pompeo\u0027s first trip, made in secret when he was still CIA director, did not win the freedom of the three captives.Pompeo said Wednesday he was \u0027thrilled\u0027 the men were now out.\u0027Though we\u0027re not quite back home yet, I welcomed them back,\u0027 he said, recounting his first words with the men after they were freed. \u0027They were happy to be with us on this plane to be sure,\u0027 he said.The three boarded under their own steam, when most of the US delegation had already got on the plane. They were seated with medical personnel in a curtained off area of the aircraft.After arriving at the stop in Japan, the men transferred to another plane with more medical facilities and were expected to land at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington in the wee hours of Thursday, where Trump planned to greet them.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/13/4BF8747000000578-0-image-m-38_1525781319453.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles waxwork unveiled Madame Tussauds display ahead royal wedding","story":"Go green like Meghan in a pencil dress by P.A.R.O.S.HP.A.R.O.S.H. bow detail dress at FarfetchBuy a lighter green version at FarfetchAfter much speculation, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle finally confirmed their engagement back in November, and the photographs quickly became iconic.

I felt very comfortable and happy in my wedding suit so I think that\u0027s the right way to go.\u0027Obviously we thought about Hannah wearing her wedding dress as well but we\u0027re not going to try and steal any limelight.\u0027Mr Gregory, who was put forward for an invitation by the Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, was singled out for his work strengthening and celebrating his local community in Blyth.His recycling initiative with pupils won a Love Northumberland award, and he is a driving force behind the Port of Blyth\u0027s STEM hub, designed to encourage pupils\u0027 engagement with STEM subjects, and inspire their future careers.The youngsters in his school have yet to find out about his invite because they are on holiday.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to tell them. We\u0027re looking at how we can make this really relevant and real to the children,\u0027 Mr Gregory said.He is, however, planning to record a video diary of his experience on the day for them.   The Welsh charity worker          Zoe Ardunell (above) will be lucky enough to see the couple for a second time, having met them during a recent visit to Cardiff Castle.The 20-year-old from Penygraig in Wales described that as \u0027a very happy day\u0027 and said Harry told her she was \u0027definitely a role model\u0027 for her work with the Valley Kids charity which helps disadvantaged children and families.She will take as her guest her 62-year-old grandmother Pat Churches, who she said \u0027loves the royals\u0027.Ms Arundell said she was relieved to see she had no plans that weekend, but quickly added: \u0027I think if I did have any plans they would be changed straight away!\u0027 Schoolgirl born with one leg          A schoolgirl born with one leg who became a charity ambassador and mental health champion is now looking forward to buying a new dress.Jorja Furze, 12, (right) says she will go shopping with her mother, Gabrielle, 39, who will also accompany her on the day, for something to wear for the event.Describing her delight at receiving an email invitation last week, the schoolgirl said: \u0027I was really excited and shocked because I didn\u0027t think I would get an invite.\u0027I had been told my name had been mentioned to some people about the wedding, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get close to it.\u0027The youngster, who was born with only a right leg, is an ambassador for the Steel Bones charity which supports civilian amputees, added: \u0027They thought I would be a good candidate.\u0027I\u0027ve grown up without a leg and they thought having someone that younger children could relate to would be good.\u0027Jorja, from the village of Isleham near Ely, Cambridgeshire, has also set up a quiet space at her high school where children with mental health issues can relax.She said: \u0027Me and my friend both suffer from anxiety and mental health, we decided we should do something because we knew a lot of people had similar problems and we convinced the teacher to let us start this up.\u0027 The community lunchers          Tessa Hince (right), who lives near Banbury, Oxfordshire, and Hayley Ash, of Shipston-on-Stour, both 32, have been running the successful Shipston Christmas Community Lunch, since 2016.The community event brings together people who might otherwise be isolated at Christmas, drawing its funds and produce from public donations.Both had already got invitations to the Queen\u0027s garden party on May 15, and joked they now needed to find different outfits for the wedding.Miss Hince, who is taking along her best friend, said she was \u0027absolutely speechless\u0027 and \u0027so excited\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s giving some coverage to this great cause,\u0027 she added.Miss Ash, who is taking her mother as a guest, said: \u0027It\u0027s crazy -

a brainchild of Harry.Mr Gillespie, who is involved with ABF The Soldiers\u0027 Charity, said he was looking forward to a busy few months with the Invictus trial results, the wedding and then a royal garden party following his BEM award last year.He said he had not told many people yet but expected his friends\u0027 reaction to be muted, compared to the feedback his girlfriend was getting.\u0027I think Kirsty has got more of a reaction, I think it (a wedding) is more of a girl thing,\u0027 he laughed.He added: \u0027It\u0027s a massive privilege, it will be a huge spectacle.\u0027                                                      Revealed: The full schedule and timings of Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding from their arrival at Windsor Castle to a glitzy evening bashRoyal fans across the country have been waiting with bated breath for the full details of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.And finally Kensington Palace have released the full schedule and timings for the big day.Here we look at what we can expect on May 19, from when the first guests arrive at Windsor Castle to the evening celebrations at Frogmore House.The couple will spend, as according to tradition, the night before their wedding apart.There will be no American-style maid of honour and all of the couple\u0027s page boys and bridesmaids – who are expected to include Prince George and Princess Charlotte – will be children.The couple will not go on honeymoon straight away – and will, remarkably, undertake their first public engagement as man and wife just days after the ceremony.

They want to be more visible and accessible, but on their terms, not ours.The Princes have spoken far more frankly about their struggles with depression following the death of their mother than anyone in their position has done before.          What wedding present will the Queen (pictured at the Royal Windsor Horse Show today) gift her beloved grandson Harry when he marries Meghan in a few days\u0027 time?Inspired by their mother, Harry and William have reached out to the homeless, the underprivileged and the disabled, in all sorts of commendable ways.They have used their high profiles to draw attention to what they see as social injustice. All this is be applauded, especially as they were reared in such a rarefied environment. Not for them state education, housework, or Saturday jobs for pocket money, starting work at the bottom of the career ladder.JANET STREET-PORTER: What poor Alfie Evans needs now is...Why SHOULD Charles automatically replace his mother as head...JANET STREET-PORTER: The tacky shrine to villain Henry...JANET STREET-PORTER: Have I got news for you, ladies - if...Share this articleHarry - once the party animal regularly photographed partying in Las Vegas and falling out of nightclubs - has railed against the restrictions imposed on him by his father and Palace advisors - and both brothers distrust the press, who they see as being partly responsible for their mother’s tragic death.By comparison, Meghan has taken some dreary jobs as she struggled to kick start her acting career - and is said to have a huge influence on Harry. He’s better dressed, has started meditating, drinking healthy smoothies, and shunning junk food.          Harry and William both distrust the press, who they see as being partly responsible for their mother Diana’s tragic death. The trio are pictured together in London in 1995Her background, with orced parents and some embarrassing relatives, gives her a far wider experience of the world than her husband. Harry spent ten years in the army, a highly regimented existence, miles away from the UK. He has never had a regular job, but promotes his charities like the Invictus Games and has just been given the courtesy job of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his grandmother.Over the years, Meghan will have gone to humiliating casting sessions, she will have been rejected many times, and will have developed a thick skin and ruthless ambition to land a job in a long-running soap.If she accepts the title of Duchess now, she will be letting working women down in a big way, women who have also struggled to rise up through the corporate and business world, to get recognition for their achievements through pay or powerful jobs.A few of these women get awarded honorary degrees and titles, if they are lucky enough to be spotted - I have a CBE (given to me by the Queen) and an MA in the Creative Arts - and I am not embarrassed about that, I worked my a*** off in the media and broadcasting for over 40 years and helped dozens of other women along the way.          Meghan Markle took some dreary jobs as she struggled to kick start her acting careerOn the other hand, the Royal women get titles for doing absolutely nothing - Catherine (or Kate) took the title Duchess of Cambridge when she married Prince William, before which she did few jobs of any note, working for a fashion retailer.Her real job is prolonging the royal lineage, having given birth to two Princes and a Princess in relatively quick succession. Harry has now slipped down the succession to number six - making it highly unlikely that Meghan will ever become a Princess.In the eyes of the British aristocracy, though, Meghan will never be ‘posh’, she is an outsider and will remain so - but that’s no bad thing.When Camilla married Prince Charles, she became the Duchess of Cornwall, and could have accepted the title of Princess. Out of deference to the memory of Diana, she declined. When Charles becomes King, Camilla’s official title will be Princess Consort.          Kate took the title Duchess of Cambridge when she married Prince William, before which she did few jobs of any note. The couple are pictured with their newborn son Louis on April 23All these titles are no guarantee that the recipient will be accepted by the narrow minded blue bloods of the English aristocracy and the landed gentry. The example of Sarah Ferguson should act as a warning to Meghan. Sarah became the Duchess of York on her marriage to Andrew, a title which she has held onto since their orce (which seems ridiculous). Andrew remains next in line to the throne after Harry and then their daughters, the party Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice - both of whom are said to get on well with Meghan.Sarah’s antics have caused maximim embarrasment to the Royals, along with her endless quest for an income - she’s appeared on TV reality shows and even endorsed weight loss programmes. Sarah has been invited to the wedding ceremony, but is said to be furious she has been denied an invitation to the party in the evening for just 250 guests. Being a Duchess cuts no ice in that company.If Harry and Meghan want to show they’re in touch with their subjects, they should decline this chance to pick up an unearned title and stick to Mr and Mrs Wales."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/00/4BF7AE5500000578-5710373-image-a-12_1525908435772.jpg","title":"Oldest human virus discovered Bronze Age bones","story":"Scientists took DNA from the skeletons to search for evidence of the Hepatitis B virus The hepatitis B virus has many mutations that no longer exist – and the information could help us prepare for dangerous new strains, scientists said.The discovery was made by carrying out DNA sampling on a Bronze Age skeleton in Osterhofen, Germany, as part of a wider study of 300 skeletons from central and western Eurasia, which are between 200 and 7,000 years old. The hepatitis B skeleton belonged to the ‘Bell Beaker’ culture, so called because of the bell-shaped pottery cups left behind.            The study, published in the journal Nature, said it was not previously known that viruses could become extinctTwo-year-old girl who \u0027was raped in Tennant Creek\u0027 tests...$3 MILLION emergency research starts into mysterious...Share this article    The hepatitis B virus has many mutations that no longer exist – and the information could help us prepare for dangerous new strains, scientists saidThe study, published in the journal Nature, said it was not previously known that viruses could become extinct. Joint lead author Barbara Muhlemann, a Cambridge University PhD student, said: ‘People have tried to unravel the history of HBV for decades. \u0027This study transforms our understanding of the virus.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/16/4C05CFE600000578-0-image-m-20_1525880437055.jpg","title":"Teacher loses legal bid wear Islamic headscarf German school","story":"    Zeynep Cetin, from the Network against Discrimination and Islamophobia, at court in Berlin after the court barred a teacher from wearing her headscarf in schoolA German primary school teacher who had wanted to wear her headscarf to work cannot do so, a Berlin court ruled on Wednesday.It pointed to a neutrality policy that prohibits civil servants from wearing religious clothing.This is the latest case in a wider controversy in Germany around wearing religious clothing and especially Muslim dress in public, following a proposal by leading conservative politicians to ban headscarves for school girls aged under 14.\u0027Primary school children should be free of the influence that can be exerted by religious symbols,\u0027 said court spokesman Martin Dressler.The school had prevented the plaintiff from teaching whilst wearing her headscarf.Dressler said that despite the court\u0027s decision, it remained in question whether Berlin\u0027s neutrality policy was in line with the federal constitution which enshrines religious freedom.Woman is stoned to death by Islamist terror group in Somalia...Muslim mother-of-four says a customer who \u0027claimed to be...Share this article\u0027It is likely that this verdict will be appealed and a higher court will look at it,\u0027 he said.In 2015 the federal constitutional court ruled that a general prohibition of the headscarf in state schools was not compatible with the constitution and the freedom of faith. It said a ban could be enforced only in inidual cases of \u0027sufficiently specific danger.\u0027          Ms Cetin (R) from the Network against Discrimination and Islamophobia talks with journalists  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/21/0CD90FDE00000514-5710681-The_fight_in_Las_Vegas_was_one_of_the_most_expensive_fights_in_h-m-28_1525899047752.jpg","title":"Sports fans conned hundreds thousands pounds phantom tickets","story":"    One person claims they were defrauded out of £40,000 for tickets to watch Mayweather v Pacquio in 2015          The fight in Las Vegas was one of the most expensive fights in historyProsecutor Joanna Hardy said customers were \u0027conned and cheated\u0027 after using \u0027legitimate looking websites, often highly positioned in internet search results to purchase tickets which never arrived with money which was never returned\u0027.She added: \u0027Would-be customers paid in excess of £30,000-£40,000 for groups of tickets for events such as boxing in Las Vegas.

What they have in common is that they each received money from one of the tranches of this ticketing fraud and then moved it one way or another through bank accounts. They laundered it.          Phantom tickets were also sold for the Rugby World Cup in 2015\u0027The websites contained false promises that real tickets were for sale.\u0027She said many customers lost their money though some were protected because they bought on their credit cards. Leigh, who allegedly has a company called RAL Event Management to which credit card ticket purchases were paid, denies two offences.They are conspiracy to commit fraud  by falsely representing sporting tickets for sale.The second charge is laundering money by converting or transferring criminal property - proceeds of a ticketing fraud - by passing it through bank accounts.Koukoulis is similarly accused of money laundering between 2 August and 10 November 2015, relating to Greenpitch.Huggins is charged with disguising or converting criminal property relating to Touchline between 26 February and 30 April 2015 by allowing funds to pass through his bank account.The jury was told that Anthony Cheriton, 54, Kent, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy involving Get Sporting and Touchline. Money from those who paid by bank transfer went into two accounts for which Cheriton was the sole signatory.          Ashes tickets were among those that were sold on the website but never deliveredAnother man, Blake Aspill, 33, of Kent, also admitted to money laundering concerning \u0027receiving over £100,000 from defrauded customers using Touchline and cascading it down through bank accounts of other people\u0027.Leigh claims in his defence he was not knowingly involved in any fraud and had no suspicion that money was coming from crime.Koukoulis claims the site he ran was entirely legitimate and the eight customers involved a civil debt not a crime.Huggins denies knowing that the money was the proceeds of crime.Three witnesses, one from Teeside, one from Basingstoke and the other from Oxford have told the court they were caught by the scam.Adil Ditta of Teeside said he paid a total of £44,295 for five tickets to the May 2015 Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquino fight in Las Vegas but never received them. Peter Chris, from Basingstoke, told the court he paid Get Sporting £1,147..08 for four tickets for the England v Wales 26 September 2015 rugby match at Twickenham but again never received them.And Paul Massara, from Oxford, said he never received Twickenham rugby tickets after paying over £1,045.70 to Greenpitch.The hearing continues."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/23/4BFED58000000578-0-image-m-5_1525818647268.jpg","title":"Now Sainsburys boss really money picks 1 8m","story":"    Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe, 57Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe may have been left red-faced when he was filmed singing We’re In The Money last week after striking a deal to buy rival Asda for £7.3billion.But just days later he was handed shares in the supermarket worth £1.8million through a long-term incentive plan.The 57-year-old, who earned £2.3million last year and £2.8million the year before, sold £864,000 of the shares to cover his tax bill. But he still owns more than 1.6million shares in Sainsbury’s, worth £4.8million.Coupe’s latest awards were part of a payout for a string of bosses, worth a total of around £5million.He is masterminding a takeover of Asda that will create Britain’s biggest supermarket chain with £51billion of sales a year.Only hours after announcing the deal to the London Stock Exchange last week, Coupe was filmed by a TV company singing: ‘We’re in the money, the sky is sunny, let’s lend it, spend it, send it rolling along.’Supermarket price war set to intensify as Aldi and Lidl...Amazon sent packing over talks on Waitrose takeover:...Walmart and Amazon go into battle to buy India¿s biggest...Air France-KLM plunges into fresh crisis after boss quits...Share this articleThe lyrics are from one of the best-known songs from the hit musical 42nd Street. The grocery chain boss was forced into a humiliating apology as fears mounted over what impact the Asda deal would have on suppliers and jobs.‘This was an unguarded moment trying to compose myself before a TV interview,’ he said.

Moyes said her funds would cover that time frame, and that she would help the organisation find future funding thereafter.“There’s a political side of me that feels dismayed that it’s down to an inidual to keep a scheme that is basically for the public good going. In an ideal world it wouldn’t be me … but we are where we are,” she said. “We live in really difficult times and I felt sometimes you just have to put your money where your mouth is, and this is a cause I believe in.”Aimed at the one in six adults in the UK with reading difficulties, Quick Reads publishes entertaining, simply written books by well-known writers from Andy McNab to Malala Yousafzai. Launched in 2006, it announced in April that it was preparing to close. Its funding from Mars Galaxy ended in 2016, and from Arts Council England in 2017, and the quest to find money elsewhere had failed.The funding from Moyes, whose novel Me Before You has sold 8m copies around the world and was adapted for film in 2016, means that Quick Reads will be able to continue commissioning books, with the next new title to be released in 2020.The Reading Agency’s chief executive Sue Wilkinson said the charity “couldn’t be more thankful to Jojo for recognising the importance of the scheme and so generously providing the funding to enable it to continue”.“It was with a heavy heart that we announced the end of Quick Reads last month, after seeking ongoing support for the initiative for 18 months,” said Wilkinson. “The moving testimonies from the public, authors and all of our partners last month demonstrated how much they value these wonderful books and how Quick Reads have touched so many people’s lives. As a charity, we are continually working to secure enough funding to keep our high-quality programmes running and support the 1.4 million people who rely on our work each year, so this is an extraordinary gift.”Moyes said she would also be more involved with the scheme. “My aim is to give them a three-year window, so hopefully I can encourage other people to support them. My intention is to make publishers take a bigger role as well, because if we don’t feed the seedbed of reading then frankly we’re not going to have readers. It’s in their interest to have this scheme not just survive, but flourish,” she said.

From a cyborg manifesto to a Don DeLillo novel, the answers are strange and compellingAs humans, we are defined by, among other things, our desire to transcend our humanity. Mythology, religion, fiction and science offer different versions of this dream. Transhumanism – a social movement predicated on the belief that we can and should leave behind our biological condition by merging with technology – is a kind of feverish amalgamation of all four. Though it’s oriented toward the future, and is fuelled by excitable speculation about the implications of the latest science and technology, its roots can be glimpsed in ancient stories like that of the Sumerian king Gilgamesh and his quest for immortality.In writing To Be a Machine, my book about transhumanism, my thinking on the subject was heavily influenced by the psychologist Ernest Becker’s 1974 study The Denial of Death. It’s an extraordinarily potent work of social anthropology, the underlying argument of which is that much of our culture is a reaction – variously destructive and creative – to the inadmissible fact of our own mortality. Though Becker was writing well before transhumanism existed as a movement, his book is useful in positioning it as a neurotic symptom of our inability to accept our own mortality. It’s also, more broadly, an eloquent and unsettling disquisition on the inexhaustible weirdness of the human animal.Speaking of inexhaustible weirdness, Becker could have written an entire book about Ray Kurzweil, the futurist and director of engineering at Google who has made a career out of the elaborate evasion of the reality of death. Kurzweil’s The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology is a monumental work of religious mysticism, which has somehow managed to pass itself off as technological futurism. It is long and complex, but its premise is simple, if incredibly strange: we are on the historical cusp of a great convergence, known as the Singularity, in which artificial intelligence becomes so powerful and sophisticated that we, as humans, will merge with technology, becoming immortal godlike creatures of infinite intelligence and capability. It’s an ecstatic vision of the end of history, from which Kurzweil emerges as a chimeric amalgam of Buckminster Fuller, Steve Ballmer and John of Patmos.Transhumanism represents a desire to obliterate the boundary between human bodies and machines, and a confusion in the first place as to the distinction between the two. Among the great books on the history of this strange and intimate relationship is Technics and Civilization, by the American historian and sociologist Lewis Mumford. Published in 1934, it’s an extraordinarily prescient polemic about the mechanisation of human life. The machine age, he argues, began not with the industrial revolution, but when humans began treating each other, and themselves, as machines. “Before inventors created engines to take the place of men,” he writes, “the leaders of men had drilled and regimented multitudes of human beings: they had discovered how to reduce men to machines.”The transhumanist movement tends to be an overwhelmingly male racket. Writing my book, there were times when I was convinced I was excavating some specifically male neurosis about our animal nature. But one of the most enduringly fascinating pieces of writing on the future of humans and technology is Donna Haraway’s 1984 polemic “A Cyborg Manifesto”, in which she puts the sci-fi idea of the cyborg to feminist uses. “The cyborg,” she writes, “is a kind of disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must code.” Haraway’s writing is strange and occasionally impenetrable, but as a vision of a posthuman existence, it’s more radical and provocative than the business-casual mysticism of Kurzweil or any of his Silicon Valley futurist colleagues.Don DeLillo’s novel Zero K is a haunting story about an aging billionaire who arranges for himself and his dying wife to be cryogenically preserved, in the hope of being reanimated once the technology’s been developed to allow them to live eternally. There are obvious echoes of the transhumanist movement, and the Silicon Valley cult of eternal youth and transformative technology that it feeds off, as DeLillo brilliantly captures the broader perversity of our culture’s fraught relationship with technology, and the strange apocalyptic tenor of our current moment.• To Be a Machine by Mark O’Connell (Granta Books, £9.99).

I mean it strikes me that the Bank’s behaving a bit like a sort of unreliable boyfriend.“One day hot, one day cold, and the people on the other side of the message are left not really knowing where they stand.”Governor Carney must feel such criticism is unfair. His ‘forward guidance’ was based on the promise that the Bank would only raise borrowing costs when the economic data justified it.But the tag has stuck - mainly because the BoE held rates through 2014 and 2015, actually ended up cutting rates after the Brexit vote in 2016.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.All eyes are on the Bank of England this morning as Britain’s central bank meets to set interest rates, and releases its latest assessment of the UK economy.And what a difference three weeks makes. For months, City investors have had today’s meeting circled in their diaries, as the moment when the BoE would raise borrowing costs for only the second time in a decade (the first was last November).After all, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has dropped plenty of hints that a rate rise was coming. However, Carney seems to have got cold feet (not for the first time either!). Last month, he pulled a screeching u-turn, telling the media that expectations of a rate rise had been overblown.That’s because recent economic data from the UK has been rather disappointing, with growth almost stalling in the first three months of 2018. It’s hardly ideal conditions to be raising borrowing costs.As this chart shows, in March investors thought a hike today was a near-certainty. Now, it would be a serious shock.Carney should prepare himself for a bruising interrogation from the economics press when he explains today’s decision, at 12.30pm.Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says some might argue that Carney has “made a mess of things” by preparing us all for higher interest rates.”Some might say Bank of England Governor Mark Carney made a mess of things again. As late as February he was still very positive on monetary policy. But dismal retail sales, disappointing GDP growth and the accelerating softening of inflation have burst Carney’s bubble.Since Carney’s credibility is obviously at stake again the question for the BoE rate decision then becomes: will Mark Carney pull off a Houdini worthy escape act, or will markets once again call him out as an “unreliable boyfriend”?“We don’t expect a rate hike tomorrow and we even envision the economic growth expectations to be lowered for the rest of the year. It’s a busy day for corporate news. Overnight, Royal Bank of Scotland finally reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the misselling of mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis.It’s paying a $4.9bn fine - in a “milestone moment” in the bank’s long, slow recovery.The other big shock is that BT is cutting 13,000 jobs, and planning to exit its London headquarters, as part of a strategic shake-up. More on that shortlyNext, the retailer, has better news it’s raised its profit forecast after reporting better than expected sales in recent weeks, as the warmer weather lured shoppers into buying new outfits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5e4f16d079155d01d10527fb00c85b01ec8d4e0/0_210_3812_2287/master/3812.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e44293e22be87ebdf7b97ca80fbcbe5f","title":"soft brexit lords tory moderates","story":"The assault on the Brexit bill – inspired by the Duke of Wellington – has emboldened Tory moderates. This could be their momentNext week the EU withdrawal bill finally emerges from the House of Lords. The bill is now a very different piece of legislation to the one launched in the Commons by David Davis last September. It was significantly amended in the Commons just before Christmas. Now the Lords have fundamentally transformed it. MPs must therefore decide what to do with the many changes that the Lords have made. It will be the most important few months of parliamentary activity in a generation, perhaps more.It was not always clear, when the withdrawal bill was launched, that such a great moment of decision would ever be reached. If the government and Labour leadership had had their way, the soft Brexit opportunities that now face MPs this summer would probably not have existed at all, or in very constrained ways. Both parties had their own reasons for wanting the bill to go through. But a combination of doggedness, craftiness and, above all, the size of the opposition in both houses to a hard Brexit has changed the political agenda through a series of hugely important amendments, often opposed by both the government and the Labour leadership.The most wide-ranging, however, was the amendment tabled by Labour’s Lord Alli to keep the UK in the European Economic Area, which was passed on Tuesday by a majority of 29, against the advice of both major parties. This would put Britain in a relationship with the EU that is comparable to that of Norway. Norway has twice voted not to join the EU, but it remains in the European single market through the EEA. Now Britain’s MPs will have to vote again, not just on the EEA, but on almost all the pivotal issues that would make the difference between a hard Brexit and a soft one.When the bill went through the Commons last autumn, relatively few of these issues raised large tussles. The one big defeat for Theresa May in the Commons was Dominic Grieve’s amendment that, in effect, requires parliament to vote to approve the final withdrawal agreement with the EU, on which work still continues. This remains a crunch issue, but it is now joined by the 13 or so Lords amendments on a wide range of other issues. These include continued membership of the customs union in some form, the adoption of the EU charter of fundamental rights into domestic UK law, and Chris Patten’s amendment ensuring that the UK and Ireland must agree any new Irish border rules before they come into force.For parliament these are all very big questions, on which there could be Commons majorities if MPs were not forced to follow party lines. Coalitions similar to the one that passed the Grieve amendment could be assembled again. Don’t forget, also, that the withdrawal bill is not the only Brexit-related legislation currently under consideration in parliament (the trade bill is particularly significant). And there is the hugely significant possibility that any new bill on the withdrawal terms could be defeated or amended (including by a demand for a fresh referendum).May’s Brexit strategy is to hold the Tory party together by withdrawing entirely from the EU, while making serious practical compromises to maintain as “frictionless” a relationship as possible with the EU, its institutions, agencies and member states – Ireland above all. Government defeats on crucial questions such as the single market, the customs union or the Irish border would overturn the entire strategy. Yet this is becoming more likely now. May’s strategy worked for her first months as prime minister. But the “lost election” of 2017 and the fundamental differences among Conservative MPs and ministers over Brexit issues that cannot be permanently postponed mean its lifetime is now almost spent. Labour’s caution on Brexit shows little sign of changing, but there are enormous temptations for Jeremy Corbyn to overcome his anti-EU instincts in order to humiliate the government on at least some of the Lords amendments.This explains why, even as she runs out of road on Brexit, May still acts as if she is hoping that something unexpected will turn up. There is now talk at Westminster of the Brexit bill votes being delayed to the autumn, partly to avoid embarrassing Commons defeats affecting the June EU summit at which the future relationship will be discussed – and partly because Conservative rebels on both sides of the argument might be more disciplined if the talks appear to be nearing a successful conclusion.It is hard to imagine that the Tory party’s Commons discipline is about to collapse on every single issue that the Lords have put on the table. Nevertheless, the Tory soft Brexiters seem a bit bolder now. That is partly because their numbers are gently creeping up – and also because, in the end, these moderate Tories feel they have to fight harder now if they are to prevent their party collapsing even further to the Ukip right.That is why every disloyal provocation by Boris\u0026nbspJohnson or other ministers – such as the foreign secretary’s “crazy” jibe this week – acts as a recruiting sergeant for the soft Brexiters. The coming weeks and months may be their moment. A hung parliament gives them the means. The slide to the right gives them the motive. And now the Lords have given them their opportunity. It will be a hot political summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d613f9e9e473f3b80987d633146581749d6ec2/247_85_2517_1510/master/2517.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c03331cf0d2e5ce9868c2fae2296617","title":"west end theatre to show all one act plays by harold pinter","story":"Exclusive: Danny Dyer, Martin Freeman and Tamsin Greig among stars of London seasonA starry lineup of actors including Martin Freeman, Jane Horrocks, Tamsin Greig, David Suchet and Danny Dyer are to appear in a mammoth and unprecedented theatrical venture to bring all Harold Pinter’s one-act plays to the West End.The ambitious season will mark the 10th anniversary of Pinter’s death by staging 20 plays over 24 weeks in the London theatre that has borne his name since 2011.The man behind the season is stage director Jamie Lloyd, who said he hoped theatregoers would feel it was a bit like collecting vinyl. “You can rediscover some great mini-masterpieces, experience those rarities you’ve been waiting ages to find, as well as stumble upon some surprising discoveries that lead you somewhere new.”Pinter, awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 2005, is regarded as one of the finest, most influential and most provocative dramatists of his generation. The word Pinteresque – long pauses, hidden menace – even appears in the Oxford English Dictionary.Lloyd said Pinter revolutionised international theatre. “He captured the comedically inane inconsistencies of everyday conversation, but, crucially, he understood that behind so much of our interaction with each other is a jostling for power – the battle for survival – or a concealment of emotion. “There is always something else lurking just below the surface.”Pinter’s plays, said Lloyd, are “as surreal, funny, dangerous, beautiful and as puzzling as life … and the political force of his words feels more vital and necessary than ever”.The Pinter at the Pinter season is supported by the writer’s widow, Lady Antonia Fraser, who called it a “great adventure”. She said: “It’s never been done before and I am deeply excited at the prospect of seeing them all together in one season.“I do have a wistful thought: if only Harold could be here to experience it himself. As it is, this is the most appropriate and thrilling way to mark the 10th anniversary of his death.”Many of the company that is being gathered were Pinter’s friends and collaborators. Danny Dyer, for example, was mentored by Pinter when he was a young actor and spoke fondly, in his own Danny Dyer way, about Pinter in a  interview.“He was the only person who I feared but loved,” Dyer said. “He had faith in me, he suffered all my shit because he knew I was a talented actor. He was a fucking tyrant too, you know, but he could get away with it because he was so enchanting. He was a poet.”Dyer appeared in the premiere of Celebration at the Almeida theatre in Islington in 2000 and its transfer to the Lincoln Center in New York. He was later in the 2001 National Theatre production of No Man’s Land and the Almeida’s 2008 production of The Homecoming.For the Pinter season Dyer, who plays EastEnders landlord Mick Carter – this week attacked by a mystery masked strangler – will appear with Martin Freeman in the dark 1957 comedy The Dumb Waiter about two hitmen holed up in a grotty basement waiting for their next job. Directors for the season include Lloyd, Lyndsey Turner and Patrick Marber, who directed the 40th anniversary production of The Caretaker. For the one-act play season Marber will direct Pinter’s rarely staged first play, The Room, starring Horrocks, and Family Voices and Victoria Station.Other highlights include Tamsin Greig in A Kind of Alaska, inspired by Oliver Sacks’s book Awakenings, about a woman who wakes up from a 29-year sleep and is suspended between the conscious and unconscious worlds. It was first performed in 1982 at the National Theatre with Judi Dench in the role.Lloyd has become known for staging commercial productions that actively and successfully seek out new, younger, more erse audiences with plays such as Macbeth with James McAvoy and Genet’s The Maids with Zawe Ashton, Laura Carmichael and Uzo Aduba.For the new season he will direct 10 of the plays, including Celebration and Party Time, with a cast that will include Ron Cook, Celia Imrie, Abraham Popoola and Tracy-Ann Oberman.Tickets go on sale on Thursday and producers are offering 25,000 across the season at £15 for people under 30, key workers and those receiving jobseeker’s allowance. At the other end of the scale, a best seats season ticket will cost £420.The season will be one of a number of cultural events marking the 10th anniversary of Pinter’s death, which include a season of his films and television work at the BFI Southbank in June and July.• Pinter at the Pinter, at the Harold Pinter theatre, runs from 6 September to 23 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/697beef694905756b7702005c1a799323eaeb012/0_0_5616_3744/master/5616.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3a90f5c1b6cafd01145ecb26cd617367 1760w","title":"the best bat experience in britain cambridges nocturnal punting safaris","story":"A trip following bats along the river Cam has become one of the hottest tickets in town – and raised money for their protectionIt’s an impossibly idyllic early summer evening on the Backs of Cambridge. A blackbird flutes as a man pressure-washes a table outside a hotel. Mating flies drift on the breeze, alongside a whiff of marijuana. A student lies flat on the riverbank, feet in the water.Punting on the river Cam has stopped for the night but one boat slips into the gathering dusk: the Bat Punt Safari.The charm of crashing into overhanging willow branches in the dark in pursuit of mostly feared nocturnal mammals is, unexpectedly, one of the hottest tickets in town. This Friday, the curtain lifts on the new bat-punting season, which has raised £36,000 for Cambridgeshire Wildlife Trust over recent summers.“It’s the best bat experience in Britain,” says Iain Webb of the Wildlife Trust, who devised the concept and is approaching his 100th safari. “The fantastic thing about nature is that you don’t know what you’re going to see. You’re constantly surprised every time you go out.”The most surprising thing Webb has seen on these nocturnal tours? A naked student swinging from a bridge. Our first strange sighting of the evening is a surfboard, adrift on the river, without any trace of an owner. “Surf’s down at the minute,” said Webb.Scudamore’s Punts, which operates the safari, has taken bookings from all over the world, with one couple flying in from New Zealand for a second time to repeat their experience.Almost as excited as the tourists is Samuel Harris, an artist and part-time punt “chauffeur”, who stands at the rear of the boat and expertly navigates fallen trees and the infamous “Dead Man’s Corner” where many a punter loses their quant (the pole) in a treacherously deep riverbed hole. It’s Harris’s first trip to look for bats. “I get a great view from where I am,” he says. “It’s a lovely thing to do on a Friday night.”A tawny owl calls and Webb deciphers the “ak-ak-ak” of a juvenile heron, unseen in the riverside willows. Then, a flit of bat against the darkening sky.It makes a wet slapping noise on the small bat detectors we hold up to pick up their echolocating sounds, which are too high for all but the youngest of human ears. Webb identifies it as soprano pipistrelle soon we drift through a feeding pack of half a dozen beneath a busy road bridge.Webb points out how their echolocation noises speed up – sounding like someone blowing a raspberry – as the bat closes in on its prey.Each bat species sounds subtly different – the high-pitched wibbling of a lesser horseshoe bat is “like a 1960s alien,” according to Webb. We don’t hear that one but we’re soon picking up the “random hand-clapping” beat of a serotine bat, which looks noticeably bigger against the indigo sky.Bats declined hugely in Britain during the 20th century with the loss of draughty roofs for roosting and the destruction of insect-rich wildflower meadows, but many species appear to be slowly increasing in number again this century.Cambridge remains a bat hotspot, with a plethora of cavernous old college roofs to roost in and plenty of insects on the river Cam’s preserved water meadows.Later, Webb takes out a high-powered lamp and sweeps it over the river. It illuminates a bat almost skimming the surface: Daubenton’s, also known as the water bat for its habit of seizing insects just above the water. With its pale belly and dipping flight, it looks like a nocturnal swallow.What’s the appeal of bats? “We’re diurnal ground-based, slow-moving mammals and they are completely the opposite,” says Webb. “There’s so much mystery, and it’s amazing how much is still being learnt about bats.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/584dfe3c8bc3fa0ebc7ba822282b00d08dd426b2/1756_0_6663_4000/master/6663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b955934fe9061cb7e0d5545bdb0aae47","title":"running wild five of the best national park runs","story":"Boost your stamina by hitting a national park trail, where natural wonders will push you to new heightsLength: 4 milesTime: 50 minutesStartfinish: Loch Morlich Beach car park (OS Explorer OL57)Grade: EasyAscent: 164 feet (50 metres)Terrain: Wide gravel paths and forest trailsRefuel: Glenmore Visitor Centre cafe (PH22 1QU)Home to the highest mountains in the UK, the Cairngorms national park is known for its snowy plateaux and abundant Munros (hills over 3,000ft914 metres). But don’t let the extreme landscape put you off lacing up your trainers, as among the lofty peaks are swathes of ancient native forests and hidden lochs to explore on foot – and you won’t need to pack an ice-axe or crampons. This gentle route takes you on a clockwise circuit of Loch Morlich, a tranquil stretch of water surrounded by woodland and fringed by sandy beaches at the foot of the northern Cairngorms. For most of the waymarked route you’ll be running through open pine forest, glimpsing views of Loch Morlich and the stunning backdrop of rounded, often snow-covered mountains mirrored in its still water. The area is a haven for wildlife – it’s worth pausing to catch your breath at one of the many burns (streams) that feed the loch, for a chance to spot dippers, wagtails and herons. As you continue around the loch keep an eye out for red squirrels darting up trees and golden eagles soaring overhead. Once you’ve completed the four-mile loop, there’s always the option to finish with a bracing dip in the water at Loch Morlich beach, famous for being one of the highest in Britain.Length: 3.8 milesTime: 1 hourStartfinish: Whitesands car park (OS Explorer OL35)Grade: ModerateAscent: 392ft (119 metres)Terrain: Coastal path and heathlandRefuel: Whitesands beach cafe (SA62 6PS)Following a section of the long-distance Pembrokeshire Coast Path, this 3.8-mile circular route around St David’s Head packs plenty into its short length. And what it lacks in mileage it more than makes up for with a magnificent seascape dominated by Ramsey Island and an archipelago of rocky islands known as the Bishops and Clerks. As you follow the undulating coast path towards the rugged peninsula of St David’s Head, it’s worth looking back at the curving mile-long sandy beach of Whitesands Bay with its rolling surf breaks. Along with breathtaking coastal views and plenty of wildlife-spotting opportunities, the route passes two prehistoric monuments: Coetan Arthur, a 5,000-year-old burial chamber, and an iron age coastal fort perched at the end of the peninsula. The inland return leg takes you through wildlife-rich heathland that skirts the lower flanks of the jagged outcrop of Carn Llidi, before rejoining the coast path back to Whitesands Bay. If you’re keen to try a spot of off-road running then this is a very accessible circuit with enough punch to give your legs a bit of a test.Length: 11 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Market Cross, OsmotherleyClay Bank car park (OS Explorer OL26)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 2,460ft (750 metres)Terrain: Stone-paved moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Lordstones cafe at Carlton Bank (TS9 7JH)Following a segment of the 109-mile Cleveland Way national trail across the northern escarpment of the North York Moors national park, this is a strenuous route with some thigh-burning ascents and descents. But at the top of each steep climb you will be rewarded with outstanding views across the national park and beyond: north to the distant conurbation of Teesside and south and east across an expanse of moors and dales. The waymarked route heads north out of the pretty village of Osmotherley before entering a rollercoaster landscape that crosses five undulating moors: Scarth Wood Moor, Live Moor, Cringle Moor, Cold Moor and Hasty Bank. Along the way, signs of the area’s industrial past are visible in the remains of alum, jet and ironstone mining the raw materials that were transported to Teesside during the Industrial Revolution. After a well-deserved break at Lordstones cafe, the route gets serious as it crosses the Three Sisters, a series of steep, rocky climbs with technical downhill sections including the impressive jagged sandstone crags known as the Wainstones, before a final steep descent brings you to Clay Bank. It’s not a route for the faint-hearted, but it certainly delivers when it comes to stunning moorland scenery. And the sense of achievement you feel at the end is most definitely worth it.Length: 7.3 milesTime: 2 hoursStartfinish: Heddon valley National Trust car park (OS Explorer OL9)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,270ft (387 metres)Terrain: Woodland track, exposed coast path and quiet roadRefuel: Hunters Inn, Heddon valley (EX31 4PY)The deep, wooded Heddon valley on the western flanks of Exmoor national park is a hidden gem for trail running, with its appealing mix of terrain, from gentle riverside paths and peaceful woodland tracks to rugged high sea cliffs and exposed moorland. And this circular route includes a healthy blend of them all. It begins in a tranquil woodland setting following an old smugglers’ path towards Heddon’s Mouth Cleave. But don’t be lulled into a false sense of “easiness” – the sting isn’t in the tail of this route, but a mere mile into the run when it climbs a steep zig-zag path to reach high sea cliffs with spectacular views across the Bristol channel to the south Wales coastline. You will need to keep your wits about you at this point as the route follows a narrow, exposed path that runs perilously close to the edge of the sheer cliffs rising more than 650ft (200 metres) above the sea below. It’s worth pausing along this coastal stretch to take in the rugged coastline, both ahead and behind you – if you’re lucky you may spot a kestrel hovering above the path or a peregrine falcon nesting in the cliff face. Veering off the coast path the route takes you across open moorland to reach its highest point at Holdstone Hill (1,145ft349 metres) before gently descending into dense oak woodland to follow Ladies’ Mile back to Hunters Inn, where you can reward yourself with a pint of local ale.Length: 10 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Cutthroat Bridge lay-by on the A57 (OS Explorer OL1)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,689ft (515 metres)Terrain: Moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Ladybower Inn (S33 0AX)The Peak District national park can certainly deliver the goods when it comes to a bracing off-road course with stupendous views. On this 10-mile circular route, prepare yourself for some hefty climbing during the first half as you ascend to Derwent Moor and journey along the ridge of Derwent Edge, but once past the trig point at Back Tor (1,765ft538 metres) the remainder of the route is much less demanding. Your first glimpse of Ladybower reservoir, a vast Y-shaped man-made reservoir, appears as you approach Whinstone Lee Tor, and as you continue northwards along Derwent Edge, passing a number of surreal eroded granite outcrops, the views of the Peak District landscape continue to impress: east across a vast stretch of exposed moorland and west along the lush Derwent valley towards the distinctive ridge of Mam Tor, Hollins Cross and Lose Hill in the distance. The final segment is a gentle leg-stretcher along the eastern edge of the reservoir through Ladybower wood, passing through the lost village of Ashopton, which was flooded during the construction of the reservoir in 1940s. This isn’t a route for putting your head down and gunning for a personal best in fact, it’s worth easing off your pace so that you can fully enjoy the spectacular scenery.Unisex Colorado running packThis pack is ideal for long trail runs, with adjustable hip belt and chest straps.

What message am I supposed to draw from it?Daisy, by emailGlad you asked, Daisy, because there are many lessons to take from I Feel Pretty, but not one of them is the message that the movie itself is promoting. Let’s look at this film, briefly. Schumer plays a woman, Renee, who feels ugly and is treated like an absolute troll by everyone around her, because that is how Hollywood thinks people who look like Schumer should be treated. She then whacks her head on a giant piece of Convenient Plot Device and is so brain-damaged that when she wakes up she thinks she looks beautiful because, Christ, you’d basically have to knock out all your grey matter to think Schumer, an A-list actress, is attractive, right? The film proceeds to laugh at her for the next two or whatever hours as she goes around town acting deranged because she thinks she’s gorgeous, which is definitely how grown women behave. She also ditches her friends because she feels too beautiful for them, which is also how women behave, and all of this is a searing exploration of the beauty standards for women or something something blah blah blah feminist lite word salad feminist lite word salad. Anyway, the film ends with Renee realising she’s not pretty, but is, like, on the inside, and she then makes a super-inspirational speech about the importance of inner beauty while selling makeup to other women the film considers equally trollish. Because inner beauty is great but, let’s be honest, gals, it has its limits.Schumer has spent much of the past few months insisting this film is all about helping women’s self-esteem, which suggests she hasn’t actually seen it. Because what it is actually saying is that women who don’t look like Emily Ratajkowski, who also appears in the film, are public laughing stocks who, at best, might learn to style it out. Well, I\u0026nbspcan’t really blame Schumer for giving it a miss because it’s absolute garbage and I’d rather eat my hands than have to sit through it again.What I am interested in is not what beauty does or doesn’t do to women, but what Hollywood has done to Schumer. There is a\u0026nbspfascinating disjunct between the stuff Schumer made for TV and the stuff she is making for the movies. Her sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, was uneven, like all sketch shows, but when it was good it was excellent, skewering standards for female beauty and the expectations society puts on women and women put on themselves. Yet her films, namely Trainwreck and I Feel Pretty, do precisely the opposite. In Trainwreck, which Schumer wrote, her character had to prove she was worth some tedious sports doctor, and to do this she had to quit her job, become a cheerleader and be physically humiliated. I Feel Pretty is one long sneer at Schumer and anyone who doesn’t look like Ratajkowski, a\u0026nbspwoman whose real-life career, as far as I can tell, is Instagramming her cleavage. Now, we can argue all day about whether photographing your boobs is a feminist pursuit or not (spoiler: it’s not), but any film that posits someone who does this as the physical ideal is not a film that can seriously claim it is fighting against the narrowness of beauty standards for women.Schumer is not the first woman whose brilliance on TV has been bleached out of her in the movies – Tina Fey has been here before her, as was Gilda Radner before that. But there is something extra dismaying about seeing Schumer make – and defend! – this egregious woman-hating garbage, when she used to be smarter than this. So the conclusion to draw, Daisy, is that Hollywood is the Sunken Place for smart women, where their souls and brains are cut out of them as they find themselves serving, zombie-like, the oppressors they once abhorred. It’s too late to save Schumer, but can we all just promise not to let Mindy Kaling, Jessica Williams and Kristen Schaal go the same way, too? Because, honestly, I don’t think my heart could take it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d9f1022caa3712baea39c46c14c378ace4a01fd/408_142_1325_795/master/1325.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e92156a3270fb9365cb4d27f03b0a22e","title":"revenge review coralie fargeat","story":"Is Coralie Fargeat’s stylish rape-revenge shocker a feminist take on the genre, or just more of the same brutality and bloodshed?Is the rape-revenge genre just a way to bring the dual spectacles of rape and violence to a male audience? This is a French movie from first-time feature director and screenwriter Coralie Fargeat, and there is no doubt that it is smart, gruesomely violent and stylishly made. The DayGlo colours in the burning sun are as fierce as the retributive action brought by the plot. It has been hailed as a subversive feminist take on this form – although it is open to question whether the film would look all that different if it were directed by a man. Revenge is not unlike Kill Bill, a modern classic that Uma Thurman has placed in a new light by disclosing what the director put her through in its making. The story concerns Richard (Kevin Janssens), a rich, arrogant type who has brought an extramarital girlfriend to his luxury chalet in the desert for a weekend’s hunting. This is super-sexy Jen (Matilda Lutz) who knows he is married, doesn’t care and enjoys being lusted over. But then arrive his two ugly incel buddies, Stan (Vincent Columbe) and Dimitri (Guillaume Bouchède) who slaver over Jen and envy Richard’s alpha-male prerogative. When he is out one morning, things take a brutal course. And then Jen, with superhuman or supernatural strength (again, very like the Bride in Kill Bill) sets out to exact a bloody revenge on all of them. These three infernos of violence are stomach-turningly shocking, though without the tension of something recognisably rooted in real life.

There is a streak of sentimentality – with which I have no real problem – but also a kind of infantilisation.Beshay is a man who has recovered from leprosy, but left with extensive scarring: he makes cash by scavenging for sellable items from the local garbage dump. Bashay is played with relaxed candour and without prosthetics by non-professional Rady Gamal. The feature was in fact developed by the director AB Shawky from his earlier documentary short entitled The Colony, about the Abu Zaabal leper colony, just outside Cairo. Bashay has been raised in the colony as a Christian, and evidently married to a woman who has depression which has been insensitively and negligently treated.When tragedy strikes Bashay, he arrives at a midlife crisis and resolves to travel somehow, anyhow, to his home village which is hundreds of miles away – to find his family, to reconnect with them, and perhaps to confront them about the way his father abandoned him. This he does sweetly in the company of a trusting young boy from the neighbouring orphanage, played by another non-professional newcomer: Ahmed Abdelhafiz. This boy’s nickname, to which he responds as earnestly as any given name, is “Obama”. It is a sort of joke which is not explicitly acknowledged until the very end when he says that his name is the same as “the guy on TV”. The humour or irony struck me on watching the film as slightly condescending and ill-considered.Obama stows away on the covered donkey-cart that Bashay has procured for his great journey. He is furious on finding the boy at first, but then they become firm friends and have many wildly implausible adventures together on the road, the unlikely nature of which we are encouraged to overlook in the interests of sympathising with his condition and applauding his stoicism and courage. Comedy is the solvent for this situation - comedy of both the gentle sort and the tougher, more acid kind when Bashay befriends a crowd of quasi-Tod-Browning disabled beggars who are finally – and again, very implausibly – to hook our heroes up with a free ride to the home village.But the pain is present too. There is a flashback to the awful boyhood moment when Bashay was left at the colony’s gates wearing a sackcloth mask which looks very like the famous mask of The Elephant Man. Later, in a bus, the grownup Bashay will furiously rail at everyone shrinking from him in disgust: “I am a human being!” His humanity is to come into full focus when he finally encounters his father. It is an affecting scene.But why was his journey only dramatically valid when taken in company with a little boy of colour named “Obama”? This is an intelligent adult we are talking about, with some hard won life experiences, and someone who appears to have had an adult relationship. I’d somehow preferred to have learned more about his marriage than the rather quaint Chaplin-and-the-kid set-up. It is a rather slight dramatic experience.

Wagner deserves similar accolades. “People said we had no chance and they were right,” he offered, his trousers hoisted back to his waist after an unfortunate and inadvertent flash as he was subjected to the bumps in front of the away support.“We were anything but a Premier League club last summer, but we have given it a go. If you have the passion, desire and spirit you can compete with top, top quality.”They have done just that, at Manchester City and Chelsea in successive games, to claim the unlikely draws to edge them to safety and effectively condemn Swansea – three points adrift of Southampton and 10 goals worse off – in the process. It was fitting Town should achieve a campaign’s objective with such a scrap of a performance, a frenzy of blocks and challenges to blunt Chelsea’s Champions League aspirations, with their resolve utterly unbreakable as the home side poured at them through the chaotic latter stages.One madcap pinball in the visitors’ penalty area seven minutes from time summed up their refusal to wilt, players flinging themselves into a succession of blocks as the ball ricocheted off the mass of bodies. When it eventually broke free to loop up invitingly to Andreas Christensen, the Dane’s header back towards the far corner was tipped thrillingly on to a post and behind for a corner by the ing Jonas Lössl. They simply would not allow Chelsea in for the victory that would have thrust them level with Liverpool. Huddersfield were not to be denied.They had briefly even enjoyed a lead here, plucked from one of their three shots. Willian lost out to Chris Lowe and with home players committed upfield, Aaron Mooy, a midfielder whose industry sets the tone, lofted a simple pass down the middle into space beyond Christensen.On to the loose ball lumbered Laurent Depoitre, a striker previously without a goal this year and noted more for his brawn than any searing pace, to attempt to lift a shot over the onrushing Willy Caballero as the pair collided on the edge of the penalty area. As the Argentinian goalkeeper lay prone on the turf Depoitre retained his composure to lift a follow-up beyond a stumbling Antonio Rüdiger and into the gaping net.The majority inside this arena blanched at the concession. Antonio Conte had rested six players here with one eye on the FA\u0026nbspCup final and while his team’s endeavour could not be doubted, it took the introduction of the cavalry – Olivier Giroud and Eden Hazard – to force parity. César Azpilicueta’s low centre fizzed across the six-yard box and Mathias Jørgensen, in attempting to hack it clear, succeeded only in belting the ball on to Marcos Alonso’s forehead. In it flew beyond a startled Lössl, the Spaniard just as shocked to have been rewarded in such bizarre fashion.Yet, for all that Rüdiger would miss two appealing opportunities from close range, that was the extent of the damage the home side would inflict. Christopher Schindler was vocal and inspirational organising his back-line, Lössl excellent in goal and the Mooy and Jonathan Hogg combination in midfield snapped into challenges to disrupt the home side’s rhythm. Chelsea could find no way through and, trailing Liverpool by two points on the final afternoon, have surely now given up any lingering hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.The vast majority of the home support had ambled away as the players went through the motions of a post-match lap of appreciation, their body language almost apologetic. This may have been Conte’s last home game in charge. “It is for the club to judge the situation and then to take the best decision,” he offered through numbed disappointment. “We have another game to play, and the FA Cup final, and then the club – for sure – will do the best to improve the situation.”The Italian is unlikely to be in the Premier League next season. Huddersfield most definitely will be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d8a3db25b5f56e3cd95d954f8458b92c104507/0_238_5605_3363/master/5605.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bc308cf453af998c15ed319407c382c","title":"young ethiopians poverty yemen the gulf","story":"Persecution and hardship in the Oromia region drives tens of thousands of migrants each year to cross the Red Sea from Djibouti, in a bid to reach the Gulf“We met in the desert,” says Badru Mohammed, gesturing at his three companions. The four Ethiopian boys pause for breath and refreshment beside the road, grasping their plastic water bottles tightly as they sip, careful not to waste a drop. The Djiboutian sun is still low in the sky but the road is already hot. They have more than 200km left to walk and their plastic sandals are disintegrating.Badru and friends are from Jimma, a poor farming district in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. Over the past fortnight they have travelled more than 1,000km from their homes, first on buses and then later on foot, jumping the border into neighbouring Djibouti under the cover of darkness. When the group gathered in Dire Dawa, a town in the arid drylands of eastern Ethiopia a couple of hundred kilometres from the border, there were 20 of them. “Most are left in the desert,” says Badru wearily. “They are very tired. I don’t think they can follow us.”Many do not make it. The numbers that die in the Djiboutian desert are unknown but there are enough unburied dead to contaminate the water supply. Ethiopians walking along the road north to Obock told the  that friends had perished en route. Another group of three, also from Jimma, say they had no food for the duration of the six-day walk from Dire Dawa. Seven of their companions were left in the desert some got lost, they say, but one they watched die. “We’ve had no help from anyone,” says the youngest, a 10-year-old orphan.The journey across the Bab el-Mandeb strait to Yemen is also perilous. One recent estimate put the numbers who have died making the crossing over the past decade at close to 3,000. The boats organised by smugglers are old, rickety and often overcrowded. Few Ethiopians can swim but the vessels, which depart at night in order to avoid detection, usually hover 20m or so away from the shore, which can be fatal for those clambering aboard.The anarchy in Yemen brings a welter of dangers. In January at least 30 people drowned when their migrant boat capsized, with reports of gunfire being used against those on board. In March 2017, a helicopter opened fire on a vessel carrying more than 140 migrants, killing 42 Somalis. Those who make it to shore then face multiple threats. UNHCR has catalogued reports of physical and sexual abuse, abduction, extortion, torture and forced labour by smugglers and criminal networks. “Only a very small minority make it to Saudi Arabia without facing at least one incident of abuse,” says Danielle Botti of the regional mixed migration secretariat (RMMS), which monitors movements between the Horn of Africa and Yemen.Those who survive remain vulnerable. Some are deported straight back to Yemen rather than home, in violation of international law. Some have their passports taken away by their employers, which is against international labour conventions. Francesco Martialis, head of Caritas, which works with street children in Djibouti, recounts the story of a 15-year-old who had fled life as a slave in Saudi Arabia. He had been beaten, his skull cracked, leaving him with amnesia. Unable to remember his family or his home, he had walked hundreds of kilometres alone along the road from Obock to Djibouti City, in the country’s south, before being picked up by police.Young Ethiopians in Obock are either unaware or unfazed by the dangers awaiting across the sea. Around 250 have set up makeshift homes under acacia trees and in caves beneath the cliffs near the rubbish-strewn village of Fantahero. “So what?” asks Hassen, a 20-year-old teacher from Wollo region. “That’s the life of the Ethiopian people.” His companion, Murad, 18, agrees: “We fear Ethiopia more than the war in Yemen.”Many cite persecution and violence as reasons for fleeing. Oromos, the country’s largest ethnic group, complain of marginalisation for more than three years anti-government protests and deadly confrontations with security forces have plagued the region. “I quit my schooling and came here,” says Mohammed, a 17-year-old from Arsi in southern Oromia. “I was a ninth-grade student. But when I saw youths like myself being arrested and thrown in jail I decided to leave. I was afraid of being arrested too.”But for most, poverty is the biggest grievance. “I’m going to Yemen because I need work,” says Hassen. “There’s nothing in Ethiopia. I have a job but it is too expensive there – 2,000 birr (£53) a month? That is not enough! In Saudi Arabia I will get 10,000 birr a month.”Three days earlier, police had arrived in Fantahero and loaded many of the boys into trucks to deposit at the Ethiopian border. But on the whole the migrants are tolerated. Obock locals have done well out of smuggling and a journey that costs somewhere between $300 and $500 (£221-£368) per person. “Nobody will control it,” says Momina Ahmed, a French-Djiboutian who grew up in the town. “All the locals, including the authorities, are profiting.”An IOM transit centre in Obock, across the road from a UNHCR camp for Yemeni refugees fleeing in other direction, is one of the few institutions available for people who want to return to Ethiopia. It assists with voluntary returns, but it can take in only around 250 at any one time. Mohammed, the schoolboy from Arsi, says he is one of the few in Fantahero to get cold feet, but that the centre was full when he visited earlier in the day.Elsewhere in Djibouti, facilities are even more scarce. Mobile health patrols started work only late last year. There are plans to build a humanitarian shelter at Lake Assal, near where the desert hits the coast. There is only one shelter in Djibouti City for migrant children, Caritas, and it is prohibited from providing beds at night.Few will return home without something to show for their efforts. “If it is the will of Allah to improve my life, then maybe one day I will return to Ethiopia,” Badru says fatalistically. Just as he speaks a police truck pulls round the corner. Within moments, the four boys have been ushered into the back by armed police officers, their long, hard journey cut suddenly short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b76e40f3e61a88ac6c8c564396be354f9f4ce11/0_185_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9459291d8e72749a48312aed5f539c26","title":"travellers community against settling local common","story":"In this series Poppy Noor discusses an issue concerning how we can build happy, well-run communities. But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesOccasionally Travellers settle on a small common near where I live. There is a playground on the common, but the caravans that were previously here weren’t near it, and didn’t take up much space. I have never noticed any problems when Travellers settle here, but the rest of my community are vehemently against it. They insist that stealing and litter-dropping rise when Travellers arrive. They have signed petitions and asked the council to prevent them from settling. This anti-Traveller sentiment seems to unite all parts of the community. Recently I noticed that large rocks and raised plant beds had been placed around the common, which someone informed me was a council initiative to stop Travellers driving on to the land. How do I know if this is true? Why is it that being anti-Traveller is still acceptable and why is the council supporting the community in this regard? Surely, the Travellers are legally allowed to settle on this land as it is held in common.Additionally, Nuttall says, it’s common for local authorities to limit opportunities for Travellers to stop over, even when it is their right to do so: “Local authorities spend hundreds of thousands every year creating ditches and earth mounds, and putting up metal barriers and gates, that prevent Travellers from settling when it may actually be cheaper to house them.” Such restrictions not only stop the council earning money through rents and council tax from the Traveller community, they also create health, education and housing inequalities.So there could be a battle ahead. I have looked into the detail of the common that you mention. It came under local authority ownership a long time ago, meaning your local council is responsible for it. You should scour your council website to see whether any development plans for the common have been included in recent planning or policy papers, giving the reason why. It’s unlikely you will find an outright mention of wanting to disturb a specific community, but you can check whether the council has considered the needs of Travellers through an equality and impact assessment, and write in to raise your concerns if not. But be wary of trying to be a saviour: your intentions may be good, but without consultation with the Traveller community, you could end up accidentally causing more harm. You can take Gypsy and Traveller cultural awareness training online.I have also found a user group that maintains the common. The members have planted trees, hedges and bulbs, so may have been involved in installing the rocks and plants. You should join this group. You won’t know whether they were involved in the decision – and whether their aims were sinister or careless – until you do. Their mission statement is to protect and enhance the common and to improve its use and enjoyment by locals. They may benefit from hearing from you if they truly want to achieve this goal. You may be the only person in the group thinking about the impact of recent changes or you may provide useful scrutiny and accountability if their aims are more sinister.You are in a difficult position. If prejudice is the driving force at play here, you may find yourself confronted with resistance and denial. But it sounds like you have the compassion and sensitivity to take on the task.

I went through the procedure again and called the branch to check the payment had only been taken once. I later discovered my account had, in fact, been debited twice. Pizza Hut said they’d sort it. In the meantime, I enjoyed my (incredibly expensive) pizza. Eight weeks on I have still not been refunded. I complained through the company dashboard, tweeted, phoned and emailed the UK CEO. At the end of week seven I was finally told the money would be refunded within four days. It wasn’t. TE, Saltney, FlintshireIn one respect, you are lucky. At least you got your pizza even if you did pay double. Others have shelled out for thin air. Something has been going wrong with the chain whose “speed guarantee” promises delivery within 30 minutes. SJ of Birmingham was left supperless after ordering via the app. “I got a call to say they couldn’t deliver as the manager had sent the drivers home and I would have to phone head office for a refund,” he writes. “I did so, and, after an interrogation, was told to expect an emailed form within 24 hours which I was to fill out to get my money back within five days. I’ve heard nothing.”KP of London reports that her student daughter is also waiting for a refund for an order which Pizza Hut cancelled due to adverse weather. “Despite numerous telephone calls, lots of Facebook and Twitter posts, there has been no refund,” she says. “It appears they want to make it so difficult you give up and let them keep your money.”Eight other readers have reported double charging, non-delivery or pizzas arriving hours after they’d given up and cancelled their order.As is so often the case when corporate standards drop, the cause appears to be an attempt at self-improvement. “We recently upgraded the process used by our customer services team and this, coupled with some technological difficulties which we have since resolved, resulted in some delays in processing refunds,” it says.“We apologise to all customers who have been affected and are working through any outstanding refunds to ensure customers receive payment as quickly as possible.”TE, SJ and KP have now been refunded. The company says it has introduced measures to improve deliveries.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

By  Sam KnightIf you have been wearing glasses for years, like me, it can be surprising to discover that you perceive the world thanks to a few giant companies that you have never heard of. Worrying about the fraying edge of motorway lights at night, or words that slide on the page, and occasionally spending a fortune at the opticians is, for many of us, enough to think about. And spectacles are unusual things. It is hard to think of another object in our society which is both a medical device that you don’t want and a fashion accessory which you do.Buying them, in my experience anyway, is a fraught, somewhat exciting exercise that starts in a darkened room, where you contemplate the blurred letters and the degeneration of your visual cortex, and ends in a bright, gallery-like space where you enjoy the spry feel of acetate in your fingers, listen to what you are told, pay more than you were expecting to, and look forward to inhabiting a new, slightly sharper version of your existing self.But what we see masks the underlying structure of the global eyewear business. Over the last generation, just two companies have risen above all the rest to dominate the industry. The lenses in my glasses – and yours too, most likely – are made by Essilor, a French multinational that controls almost half of the world’s prescription lens business and has acquired more than 250 other companies in the past 20 years.There is a good chance, meanwhile, that your frames are made by Luxottica, an Italian company with an unparalleled combination of factories, designer labels and retail outlets. Luxottica pioneered the use of luxury brands in the optical business, and one of the many powerful functions of names such as Ray-Ban (which is owned by Luxottica) or Vogue (which is owned by Luxottica) or Prada (whose glasses are made by Luxottica) or Oliver Peoples (which is owned by Luxottica) or high-street outlets such as LensCrafters, the largest optical retailer in the US (which is owned by Luxottica), or John Lewis Opticians in the UK (which is run by Luxottica), or Sunglass Hut (which is owned by Luxottica) is to make the marketplace feel more varied than it actually is.Between them, Essilor and Luxottica play a central, intimate role in the lives of a remarkable number of people. Around 1.4 billion of us rely on their products to drive to work, read on the beach, follow the whiteboard in biology lessons, type text messages to our grandchildren, land aircraft, watch old movies, write dissertations and glance across restaurants, hoping to look slightly more intelligent and interesting than we actually are. Last year, the two companies had a combined customer base that is somewhere between Apple’s and Facebook’s, but with none of the hassle and scrutiny of being as well known.The creation of EssilorLuxottica is a big deal. It will have knock-on consequences for opticians and eyewear manufacturers from Hong Kong to Peru. But it is also a response to an unprecedented moment in the story of human vision – namely, the accelerating degradation of our eyes. For several thousand years, human beings have lived in more or less advanced societies, reading, writing and doing business with one another, mostly without the aid of glasses. But that is coming to an end. No one is exactly sure what it is about early 21st-century urban living – the time we spend indoors, the screens, the colour spectrum in LED lighting, or the needs of ageing populations – but the net result is that across the world, we are becoming a species wearing lenses. The need varies depending where you go, because different populations have different genetic predispositions to poor eyesight, but it is there, and growing, and probably greater than you think. In Nigeria, around 90 million people, or half the population, are now thought to need corrective eyewear.At the same time, across the developing world, a slower and more complex process is underway, as populations age and urbanise and move indoors to work. The history of eyewear tells us that people do not, as a rule, start wearing glasses because they notice everything has gone a little out of focus. It is in order to take part in new forms of entertainment and labour. The mass market in spectacles did not emerge when they were invented, in 13th-century Italy, but 200 years later, alongside the printed word in Germany, because people wanted to read.In 2018, an estimated 2.5 billion people, mostly in India, Africa and China, are thought to need spectacles, but have no means to have their eyes tested or to buy them. “The visual ide”, as NGOs call it, is one of those vast global shortcomings that suddenly makes sense when you think about it. Across the developing world, straightforward myopia and presbyopia, the medical name for longsightedness, have been linked with everything from high road deaths to low educational achievement and poor productivity in factories. Eye-health campaigners call it the largest untreated disability in the world.It is also a staggering business opportunity. Essilor and Luxottica know this. It was Essilor that worked out and first publicised the 2.5 billion statistic, in 2012. “For 2,000 years people were living mainly outside,” said Hubert Sagnières, Essilor’s chairman and chief executive, when we met recently in Paris. “Suddenly, we live inside, and we use this.” He tapped his mobile phone on the table. The legal and technical details of the EssilorLuxottica merger will take a few years to iron out, but Sagnières was transparent about its mission: to equip the planet with eyewear over the coming decades. “I am driving a very profitable company,” Sagnières told me. “You know, between 2020 and 2050, governments will not solve all the problems of the world.”The looming power of EssilorLuxottica is the subject of morbid obsession within the eyewear world. Everyone knows the new company is poised to have a profound impact on the way that we are going to see. “Forgive me,” said one longtime entrepreneur in the sector. “But it is nothing short of control of the industry.” One investor described the new corporation as a “category killer”. In many conversations, people described its arrival, which would have been genuinely unthinkable a generation ago, as both extraordinary and somehow inevitable at the same time. That struck me as the kind of contradiction you come across more often in a person than in a business. And it is true of EssilorLuxottica and, to some extent, the business of vision itself, because it is – to an amazing degree – the legacy of a single man.Leonardo Del Vecchio is the patron, legend and haunting spirit of the global eyewear business. He is its Citizen Kane and its Captain Ahab. His father died before he was born his mother was poor and he was raised in an orphanage in wartime Milan, where he went out to work as a metal engraver at the age of 14. In 1961, Del Vecchio opened a workshop in the town of Agordo, in the Dolomite mountains. He was 25, and starting out on his own. The valley around Agordo was emptying out because of the closure of a mine, and the town was giving away land to companies that were willing to move there. Del Vecchio asked for 3,000 sq metres on the riverbank to build a factory to make parts for spectacles. He had a young family, and in time, he built a house next door to the workshop so he could step from one to the other, starting his day at 3am.Over the next half century, Del Vecchio grew his company, which was called Luxottica, into the world’s greatest maker of glasses frames. In an industry that was traditionally fragmented and small-scale, the totality of Del Vecchio’s ambition took his rivals by surprise. He sought to control every element in the business, from the metal alloys of the hinges to the stores where eyewear is sold. “Never assume that you have arrived, or look at the world as your only point of reference,” he liked to say. In a series of audacious takeovers, Del Vecchio acquired brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley and Persol, and signed contracts with fashion houses such as Armani, Ralph Lauren and Chanel. He built factories in China, acquired vision insurance schemes in the US and retail chains on four continents.Since 1994, Del Vecchio has been Italy’s highest inidual taxpayer and the country’s second-richest man. A few years ago, people thought his career had run its course. But in January 2017, at the age of 81, Del Vecchio announced the greatest deal of his life, in which he also secured the final missing part for his frames – the lenses – when Luxottica agreed to merge with Essilor. “He wants to do this merger,” a former colleague said, “thinking he will leave behind this great company that will last for 100 years.”When I arrived in Agordo one recent afternoon, it was thinking about starting to snow. The town rests among steep wooded hills and the bare grey sides of mountains. The blue buildings of the Luxottica factory, with Del Vecchio’s house still standing by the entrance, glowed across the river. Although the plant is now merely one of the company’s 12 frame manufacturing facilities, which stretch from São Paulo in Brazil to Dongguan in southern China, the founding in Agordo remains Luxottica’s organising myth. Every year, Del Vecchio hosts a Christmas dinner for the plant’s 4,500 workers (the town of Agordo has a population of 4,000), which is entertained by an Italian pop star of his choosing. “People are screaming and crying when he comes in,” said Giorgio Striano, Luxottica’s chief operating officer. In Agordo, Del Vecchio is referred to as simply, “Il Presidente”.For the company’s 30th anniversary, in 1991, Del Vecchio renovated some 15th-century stables in the middle of Agordo and opened a private glasses museum. The curator, Caterina Francavilla, who is the daughter of Del Vecchio’s longtime deputy, showed me round before she closed up for the day. The first glasses were almost certainly made in northern Italy in the last decades of the 13th century. (Lenses are called lenses because they looked like lentils.) But for centuries after their invention, spectacles and other magnifying lenses were mostly rejected by medical men, who warned of their unnaturalness and recommended potions to correct people’s eyesight instead. In The Perfect Oculist, of 1666, Robert Turner, a London doctor, recommended turtle’s blood and the powdered head of a bat for the treatment of squints. For weak eyesight, you might try wearing cow’s eyes around your neck.The cabinets in Del Vecchio’s museum traced the evolution from the leather frames and hinged bridges of the middle ages to the gold rims of the 19th century. There were opera glasses designed by Napoleon for his Polish mistress, Maria Walewska a pair of Emperor Franz Joseph’s spectacles and some pink “occhiali appartenenti a Elton John.” No one knows why it took 400 years to put the arms on glasses – which are known as temples, and were pioneered in London in the early 18th century – so they finally sat comfortably on people’s ears. To mark another historic milestone, one cabinet also held a copy of Luxottica’s slender debut catalogue, from 1971, when the company made its first complete frames.On a shelf near the door of the museum, I spotted A Man Who Sees Far, an official Luxottica biography of Del Vecchio, which was published in 1991. I expected the optical world to be genteel and polite, and was taken aback whenever conversations turned to the personal charisma, and menace, of Del Vecchio. “He’s the godfather,” said Dean Butler, who founded LensCrafters in 1983. (Del Vecchio bought it in 1995.) “The godfather, to me, is the guy. He runs it.” One former senior Luxottica executive told me: “Honestly, he kind of rules by fear.” Very few opticians would even mention Del Vecchio’s name – lending him a Voldemort-like aura – for fear of offending him, however unlikely that might be. One talked about “getting a horse’s head in the bed”. Another concluded our interview by saying: “You can quote me as long as it sounds like I am sucking Del Vecchio’s dick.”I took A Man Who Sees Far back to my hotel. Even in the company’s hagiography, Del Vecchio comes across as improbably driven and unfeeling. The biographer struggles to get a few words with Il Presidente as he crosses the tarmac to his private jet. (Del Vecchio rarely gives interviews he declined to speak to me.) “There were no kisses, no cuddles,” his eldest daughter, Marisa, recalls in the book. “Frankly, we were scared of him.”Del Vecchio built the empire of Luxottica on two ideas. The first was to do everything itself. After the company’s initial progression from parts to frames in the early 1970s, it set out, step by step, to control the entire process of making and selling glasses, from acquiring the raw materials to selling its own products in its own stores. No one had done this before Del Vecchio. “There is a simplicity to him,” one former colleague told me. “To him it is a very simple equation: I make the best stuff, why doesn’t everybody buy it?”For the first 25 years, Luxottica stayed on the wholesale side of the industry – “behind the curtain”, as it is known – selling its glasses through opticians to the public. In the 1990s, however, Del Vecchio decided he wanted a retail network too. First, he got Luxottica listed on the New York stock exchange, an almost-unheard of move for a mid-sized Italian business. “A lot of big experts said it was impossible,” said Roberto Chemello, the chief executive at the time. Luxottica later estimated the listing to have been worth around $100m in advertising in the US – and it laid the ground for Del Vecchio’s hostile takeover of US Shoe, a conglomerate that owned LensCrafters, the country’s largest optical chain, in 1995. On paper, the deal appeared outlandish. US Shoe was five times larger than Luxottica, and its board did not want to sell. Having its own shops would also put Luxottica in direct competition with the thousands of optometrists it had been supplying for decades. “You have to be not only courageous,” said Chemello, of the transaction, “but a little bit crazy.” Luxottica bought US Shoe for $1.4bn.Once the deal was done, Del Vecchio promptly broke up US Shoe, whose roots went back to 1879, until all that was left were the LensCrafters stores that he wanted in the first place, which he proceeded to fill with Luxottica frames. “That is exactly the formula they have used ever since,” said Jeff Cole, the former chief executive of Cole National Corporation, an even larger optical retailer that sold out to Luxottica in 2004. “When they buy a company, they spend a little time figuring it out and kick out all the other suppliers.”In the factory in Agordo, I saw dual-armed robots pinning together the front and temples of Ray-Ban Wayfarers, and basket after basket of metal frames being dunked in a series of chemical baths to coat and colour them. Glasses may appear to be relatively simple objects, but they involve between 180 and 230 manufacturing stages to produce. With its own designers, lasers and massive, quietly humming machines, Luxottica can take a pencil sketch to global production in about three weeks. “We are in a closed loop,” said Striano, the operations chief. Taking into account all the different colours and face shapes (Japanese noses are not the same as Latino noses), Luxottica has around 27,000 models in production at any one time. Its plants turn out 400,000 pairs of frames per day. I asked Striano if any other company came close. “I think nobody,” he said.Del Vecchio’s second great insight is the one that changed the nature of the optical business – and that was to combine it with the fashion industry. Although designers such as Pierre Cardin and Christian Dior had been experimenting with frames since the 1960s, Del Vecchio saw a way to take their ideas, and more importantly, their labels, to a mass market. In 1988, he signed a licensing deal with Giorgio Armani, another self-made tycoon, who had started out as a window-dresser at a department store in Milan. The deal transformed the glasses game. Until then, consumers in Europe and America who wanted fancy spectacles had to rely on staid, industry names such as Zeiss, Rodenstock or Silhouette. After the Armani deal, they could buy Prada, Gucci and Chanel, and they were willing to pay for it. “It created something,” as one Luxottica manager artfully told me, “to make the needs where probably they are not.”People in the industry observe that taste in frames follows a roughly 30-year cycle, from metal, to rimless, to acetate and back again, in which familiar spectacle shapes recur and then disappear. The trend right now is towards metal, and designs that last flowered in Ronald Reagan’s America. In the “Style Area” in Agordo, on the factory’s first floor, I met Mario Mollo, a senior product manager. “You see now the 80s is becoming very popular,” he said. “You see shallow, very wide.”Mollo was poring over a desk of large-scale drawings of a new acetate frame for Oliver Peoples, named “Leonardo”. Spectacle frames require a thousand barely noticeable design decisions, around the shape of the bridge, the thickness below the eyes, or the pantoscopic tilt (how the angle of the lens meets the front of your cornea). The Leonardo had an unusual temple, in which a curving piece of wire had to be sandwiched between two pieces of acetate. “Sometimes this one is not easy to find the right bending,” said Mollo, tracing his finger along the drawing. Like every other senior Luxottica figure I met in Agordo, Mollo was Italian, male, dressed in cashmere, and wearing a pair of the company’s frames. On a workbench a few feet away, there was a pair of €4,000 (£3,500) Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana sunglasses that were hand-painted in Sicily, made out of wood and looked like a carnival float. “With sun, you can go totally crazy,” said Mollo. Luxottica had made only 100 for the entire world. “Crazy,” said Mollo, “but sold out.”The transformation of glasses from a medical device to a means of self-expression, like clothes or sneakers, has been a source of joy for millions of people. But it has also obscured their original purpose, and complicated efforts to distribute them as easily as, say, mosquito nets or aspirin. When I mentioned this to Mollo, he recalled a recent trip he had taken with Luxottica’s corporate social responsibility programme, conducting eye tests and distributing glasses in rural China. “They were so happy having the possibility to see. They were hugging us. It was really not for fashion,” he said. “Then they started, you know, looking at themselves,” – Mollo paused for a second – “and the fashion moment arrived.”The fusion of the fashion industry and the optical business is now regarded as complete. Until recently, eye-health charities and campaigners used to distribute thousands of pairs of secondhand glasses from richer countries to poorer populations that lacked them. In 2011, the World Health Organization advised them to stop – in part because people were refusing to wear outdated styles. “Being poor doesn’t mean we want to look stupid, you know,” Prof Kovin Naidoo, who runs the Brien Holden Institute, one of the world’s leading eye-health NGOs, told me.My last stop in Agordo was Luxottica’s sample room, a broad, quiet, carpeted space looking out over the river. The room contains every current Luxottica design, arranged on various tables and ranked in order of sales. The system has been in place since the plant was built in 1972, and during that time, it has been the domain of Luigi Francavilla, Luxottica’s deputy chairman, who is now in his early 80s. “Glasses are beautiful,” he said, pausing among the hierarchies of Ralph Lauren, Valentino and Bulgari models. “Especially the ones that sell the most.”It was snowing outside and Francavilla was wearing a thick blue cardigan. One of the first things he did was to take my glasses off my face to identify the tortoiseshell acetate, which is known as Havana. His own glasses were a pair of rimless Ray-Bans with pink carbon-fibre temples. Luxottica bought Ray-Ban from Bausch \u0026amp Lomb, one of the 20th century’s great optical companies, in 1999. At the time, the label was washed up. You could buy a pair of Aviators at a petrol station for $19 (£14). “It was a train smash,” a former senior Luxottica executive told me. “They were selling Wayfarers at Walmart.”Del Vecchio paid $645m (£476m) for Ray-Ban. During the negotiations, he promised to protect thousands of jobs at four factories in the US and Ireland. Three months later, he closed the plants and shifted production to China and Italy. Over the next year and a half, Luxottica withdrew Ray-Ban from 13,000 retail outlets, hiked their prices and radically improved the quality: increasing the layers of lacquer on a pair of Wayfarers from two to 31. In 2004, to the disbelief of many of his subordinates, del Vecchio decided that Ray-Ban, which had been invented for American pilots in the 1930s, should branch out from sunglasses into optical lenses, too. “A lot of us were sceptical. Really? Ray. Ban. Banning rays from the sun?” the former manager said. “But he was right.”How did just two companies – one in frames, and one in lenses – come to dominate something as generic, as obvious, as glasses? It’s almost as if the world had one manufacturer for pens, and another for ink. The conditions that have allowed for the rise of Essilor and Luxottica are rooted, deep down, in the way spectacles are sold. Until the end of the 19th century, you could buy a cheap pair of glasses – for reading or for distance – out of a rack in Woolworth’s, or from a jewellery shop, or a guy in the street. Eyewear was a craft of tinkerers and inventors. “I this evening did buy me a pair of green spectacles,” Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary on Christmas Eve 1666, “to see whether they will help my eyes or no.” (They didn’t Pepys’ failing eyesight forced him to give up his journal three years later.)It was the birth of the optometry profession, around 1900, that changed things. This was a new breed of sober, respectable spectacle-sellers – not unlike pharmacists – who wanted to standardise eye tests and to restrict the sale of glasses to licensed professionals. Their aim, for the most part, was to raise standards. Eyeglass pedlars in the 18th and 19th centuries were notorious for scams and faulty lenses. But there was also another compelling reason to take a cheap, widely available product and put it in the hands of a few authorised sellers – and that was to make money.The first opticians had a tough time of it. They were disdained by ophthalmologists – proper eye doctors, who had trained in hospitals and considered themselves above the tawdry trade in glasses. The first optometry course in the US was taught at Columbia University’s physics department because it was not allowed inside the medical school. (A remnant of this prejudice still holds: within the optical industry, optometrists are always being teased for their chippiness and self-importance. “One step above dermatology,” a former Luxottica executive sniped to me).But the new professionals persevered and, in a way, the story of optometry for much of the 20th century was of finding new ways to protect their patch. Across Europe and in the US, optometry laws and regulations were passed to control the prescription and selling of eyewear. Many of these had a “doctorly” aspect, but they also had the effect of creating a highly opaque marketplace. For a long time, opticians fought all forms of advertising, for example, which might force them to spell out their prices and allow customers to shop around. In some places, this reached ridiculous extremes: in Kentucky, for a time, optometrists’ signs could not be more than four inches high. Under Britain’s Opticians Act of 1958, the display of prices was banned altogether, which meant that opticians were more or less free to make them up on the spot. “The price would come from a little black book,” one veteran practitioner told me. “There was a lot of sharp practice around.”This was when Essilor came on the scene. In 1972, Essel and Silor, two French optical companies, merged and began sell aggressively into the US market. Essilor specialised in plastic lenses, which were replacing glass, and it also had a magical product: “Varilux”, the world’s first progressive lens, invented by an Essel engineer named Bernard Maitenaz in 1959. Progressive lenses allow people who are both long- and shortsighted – typically older customers – to combine their prescriptions into a single, graduated lens. The early Varilux models were experimental and not everyone could adapt to them, but they were probably the most important innovation in eyewear since the invention of bifocals around the time of the French revolution. The company set out to make sure that Varilux and the rest of its products (Essilor’s current sales manual runs to around 400 pages) were sold in every optometrist in the world.Lenses are the pixie dust of the optical business. Barely anyone knows what they are made of, how they are constructed and, especially at the high end, exactly how they work. For the last half century, persuading opticians to prescribe Essilor, as opposed to Hoya or Zeiss, the company’s main rivals, has been painstaking, face-to-face work. One British optician, who stocks Essilor, described it to me this way: “Is there a difference between an Audi, a BMW or a Mercedes? Probably not. But you prefer that badge to that badge, or the way they win hearts and minds.” For years, the company has brought opticians to Paris and its Essilor Academy, where they are wined and dined and taught about its latest products. “It’s not really bribes it’s the way it works,” one industry veteran told me.And when all else fails, Essilor – like its rivals, and like all wholesalers – uses financial incentives to keep its customers satisfied. Opticians and industry analysts that I spoke to for this article described how Essilor uses so-called “spiff money” – offering stores large, multi-year discounts and cash bonuses for selling its products – in order to squeeze out the competition. “Essilor wants to dominate this industry worldwide,” one retailer told me. “They are actually a well run company. They are not a ruthless company. But they get away with all this crap which in any other industry would be anti-consumer.”Some opticians call Essilor “The Big E”. The company boasts of supplying between 300,000 and 400,000 stores around the world – three or four times as many as Luxottica. “The strategy has to be absolutely global,” Sagnières, the chief executive, told me. “Not just for the rich or poor.” The company has not restricted itself to lenses by any means. If Luxottica has spent the last quarter of a century buying up the most conspicuous elements of the optical business (the frames, the brands and the high-street chains) then Essilor has busied itself in the invisible parts, acquiring lens manufacturers, instrument makers, prescription labs (where glasses are put together) and the science of sight itself.The company holds more than 8,000 patents and funds university ophthalmology chairs around the world. In deals that rarely make the business pages, Essilor buys up Belgian optical laboratories, Chinese resin manufacturers, Israeli instrument makers and British e-commerce websites. You can find threads on optometrist message boards with headings like “Essilor Has Purchased and Now Owns (Insert Company Name Here)”, which attempt to record all the independent lens makers and laboratories that used to exist. Within the industry, the Big E is generally considered less rapacious than Del Vecchio’s Luxottica people regard it instead as a kind of unstoppable, enveloping tide.The companies saw themselves differently too. “I think Essilor, while not a model company by any means, has a moral purpose,” the former manager said. “With Luxottica, it’s just lip service. It is all about domination.” The most infamous Luxottica deals carried an edge of brutality. In 2001, the company clashed with Oakley, the world’s hottest make of sunglasses at the time. Luxottica had just bought Sunglass Hut, which sold a third of the US’s sunglasses, and Del Vecchio demanded that all its suppliers drop their prices. Oakley refused. In the summer of 2001, the company’s founder Jim Jannard flew to Milan to meet Del Vecchio and strike a deal. Jannard had founded Oakley out of the back of his car in 1975. According to Forbes magazine, at the end of their conversation, he said he hoped the two men would one day be friends. “We will never be friends,” Del Vecchio reportedly replied.After Oakley sued in 2001, Luxottica issued a statement “denying the allegations in Oakley’s complaint in all material respects” and the case was settled out of court. But Luxottica won the war, buying Jannard’s company for $2.1bn (£1.5bn) in 2007.By that time, Del Vecchio appeared ready to retire. In the summer of 2004, as he approached his 70th birthday, Luxottica’s founder handed over day-to-day control of the company to Andrea Guerra, a young chief executive he hired from Indesit, the Italian white goods company. Under Guerra, Luxottica rationalised its manufacturing, shifting more production to China. It also became more stable and predictable. The share price trebled. But according to several former executives who were close to Guerra, he was opposed to any deal with Essilor, seeing the company as a long-term rival. (Guerra declined to speak with me). “He did not want to merge with Essilor,” a colleague said. “He wanted to protect us in a different way.”In 2014, however, Del Vecchio came back to work. He was 79. “We were all pretty shocked,” a former senior Italian executive told me. But it became clear that Del Vecchio was worried about what would happen to Luxottica when he dies. “His most precious child is this company,” the US manager told me. Del Vecchio has six children from four marriages to three women (he remarried his second wife, Nicoletta Zampillo, in 2010) but he has always insisted they will never succeed him. According to several senior figures at Luxottica, Del Vecchio came to believe that folding Luxottica into Essilor was the best way for his work to endure, and informal talks between the two companies began.In many ways, the final chapter of Del Vecchio’s rule at Luxottica has been chaotic and disorienting. Guerra was soon forced out. After that, Del Vecchio went through four chief executives in three years. In his early 80s, he is no longer the force that he once was. Subordinates told me that Del Vecchio can no longer work a full week and sometimes loses his place in meetings, while demanding to sign off on decisions as small as the floor-plans of new Luxottica stores. Dozens of senior managers have left. “He really doesn’t trust anyone,” one told me.But throughout his shaky return, Del Vecchio kept his eyes on the prize, meeting in secret with Sagnières, the CEO and chairman of Essilor, until, by the summer of 2016, Sagnières said, “it was obvious” that the deal would go ahead. When the two men announced the formation of the combined company on 16 January last year in a call to investors, Del Vecchio’s voice came on the line. “I’m very pleased to be here with you today,” he said, “to present the achievement of a lifetime dream.”Over the coming decades, EssilorLuxottica will have the power to decide how billions of people will see, and what they can expect to pay for it. Public health systems are always likely to have more urgent problems than poor eyesight: until 2008, the World Health Organization did not measure rates of myopia and presbyopia at all. The combined company can choose to interpret its mission more or less however it wants. It could share new technologies, screen populations for eye problems and flood the world with good-quality, affordable eyewear or it could use its commercial dominance to choke supply, jack up prices and make billions. It could go either way.The bigger picture takes a moment to discern. Late last year, I visited Britain’s most important optical collection, which is kept in the basement of the Royal College of Optometrists, a townhouse around the corner from Charing Cross Station. For the last 19 years, Neil Handley, the college’s historian, has been cataloguing 27,000 items donated by opticians and eyewear manufacturers, discovering the story of the industry as he goes along. “It’s under the radar,” he said. “It’s not something that is talked about.” When I asked Handley about the creation of EssilorLuxottica, he pointed to an old display of British spectacle parts, made by a firm called Hadley in Surrey in the 1930s. Until the 1970s, and the rise of cheap manufacturing in China, Britain used to have hundreds of frame-makers up and down the country.Today it has four.“What you are seeing is a potential monopoly, and the risk that brings,” said Handley. While it’s easy to fixate on the brands and the profits of the giants of the optical sector, the industry as a whole must expand dramatically in order to serve the world’s growing, ageing populations and increasing myopia among the young. “The danger is if their proposed answer to these problems turns out not to be the answer,” said Handley. “They have stifled all opposition, and so nobody else has the chance to come up with the right answer.” The stakes are highest in parts of the world that currently do not have anything like enough access to eyewear – what the industry calls the “white spaces” of Africa and parts of Latin America and Asia.“It is always better if there is more ersity in the market, and less dominance,” said Prof Naidoo, of the Brien Holden Institute, about the impact of the merger. “I don’t think anyone can argue with that.” In 2013, Naidoo was one of the authors on a groundbreaking paper that forecast that half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050 – almost 5 billion people. In the course of a single generation, across the world, from Inuit communities in Alaska to secondary-school students in Northern Ireland, researchers have recorded a rough doubling in the number of people who become short-sighted as children.The main reason, as far as anyone can agree, is a reduction in the time that they spend outdoors. Sunlight helps to moderate levels of dopamine, which in turn influence the development of the eye. Too much dopamine means eyeballs grow too long, and become oblong in shape, focusing light in front of the retina, rather than on it. Vision campaigners forecast that the myopia epidemic will put enormous strain on health systems across the developing world, which are already unable to equip their populations with a medical device that has been around since the Middle Ages. “We are barely managing in healthcare systems to provide eyecare,” said Naidoo. He corrected himself. “Not barely. We are not managing. Can you imagine, when those numbers are doubling and tripling, what is going to happen?”Naidoo was reluctant to criticise EssilorLuxottica, however. In part that is because Essilor is the world’s leading commercial funder of research into eye health, and a prominent force in improving access to corrective lenses. (Naidoo sits on the board of the company’s Vision Impact Institute in Paris.) Essilor’s €200m R\u0026ampD budget is three times the size of the rest of the industry combined, and it has a ision called 2.5 New Vision Generation, named for the 2.5 billion people who currently need glasses but don’t have them. The company is investing in schemes such as mobile optometry, putting eye-health workers on motorbikes in Indonesia at network of around 4,000 village-level optical stores in India door-to-door salespeople in the favelas in Brazil and working with the Liberian health system to get its products to what it calls the “base of the pyramid”. Last month, Essilor pledged to provide 200m pairs of free ophthalmic lenses to the estimated 900 million people living in the Commonwealth without access to glasses.In some of the least-served markets in the world, Essilor is more or less the only game in town. In 2016, the company opened an office in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country of 78 million people and 200 optical stores. Last year, Essilor acquired a prescription laboratory in Ethiopia, which currently has roughly one ophthalmologist for every million people. (In European countries, the ratio is about a hundred times smaller.) In places like these, all that eye-health campaigners can do is watch, and hope. “If the merged organisation decreases that investment, that will be a tragedy,” said Naidoo. “And that risk is there, you know. We can just hope that the merged organisation will see there is an opportunity to grow more, rather than less.”No one at Luxottica was willing to speak in detail about its plans for the merged company. It was a different story when I visited Essilor’s global headquarters, which is on a quiet street of apartment blocks in Charenton-le-Pont, in south-east Paris. The company’s senior executives are, as a rule, noticeably more nerdy and less well-dressed than their Italian counterparts, but they are much more comfortable in their role as titans of the global optical industry. Sagnières, the company’s 62-year-old chief executive and chairman, had the guileless glee of a high-school geography teacher whose class had just aced their exams. “I won!” he said, describing the deal with Luxottica. “Anything can happen. I won already. You won. Your kids won! Seriously, this is how it is.”Sagnières told me that the company has calculated – on the basis that a simple pair of glasses costs €5 – that the world can be supplied with eyewear for around €500m a year for the next 30 years. Just as importantly, any investment that EssilorLuxottica ploughs into the bottom end of the market is likely to pay off in the end. “We know that in three or five or 10 years, one day their life will have changed that much that they will afford to pay $50 for a better lens or $50 for branded frames,” said Sagnières. “I am fine with that.”A few days later, I visited one of Essilor’s research facilities in a former lens factory in Créteil, on the southern edge of the city. In a room full of brightly coloured furniture and signs that said things like “How can boomers enjoy their vision in all light conditions?” I met Dr Norbert Gorny, the company’s head of R\u0026ampD. Gorny is a tall, direct, German veteran of the optical scene, who explained that Essilor has spent much of the last decade expanding what it calls “the acuity corridor” on its progressive lenses, to help people read digital devices as they move around, compared to the more static way we used to read books and newspapers. But the company is increasingly keen to reach what it calls its “Next Generation Consumers” – people in the developing world who don’t wear glasses yet. Gorny called them “The Uncorrected”.“We do things for the 2.5 billion uncorrected,” he said. “But we also do things for people’s needs that are not already expressed.” During the afternoon, he showed me rooms where researchers put on motion sensors, as if they are in a Hollywood studio, to measure the depth of vision required for everyday tasks. Gorny also talked teasingly about new lenses that the company is developing with unnamed tech companies to supersede Google’s failed “Google glass” project of a decade ago. This time around, the idea is to project information from the internet – maps, messages, and Twitter, I suppose – directly on to the back of people’s eyes. “You can read easily – always sharp – information about where to go, the email that you did not want to miss,” said Gorny. “I leave it to your fantasy.”In How We Got to Now, Steven Johnson’s book about innovation, he describes the crude reading lenses of medieval Europe as the first piece of technology “since the invention of clothing in Neolithic times, that ordinary people would regularly wear on their bodies.” It was possible, listening to Gorny and thinking of the teenagers of Seoul, urbanising populations in Africa, and people walking through European cities with their eyes fixed to their phones, to imagine a point where more or less the whole of humanity is watching the world through intermediating screens on their eyes. I asked Gorny whether he thought the 21st century, with its demographic changes, myopia epidemic and urge for digital information, would bring about a second optical revolution, in the manner of Germany’s printing presses in the 15th century. Will EssilorLuxottica become the Facebook of seeing? “I don’t know whether we are starting a revolution, witnessing a major change like we witnessed 500 years ago,” Gorny said. “What I believe is we are in the right industry at the right time.”The question is whether there is anyone, beyond its shareholders, that will be able to hold EssilorLuxottica to account. I’m not sure there is. The next few years might be rocky, as the new company grapples with its size and attempts to find a new leader who can define the corporation and its ultimate goals under the fading shadow of Del Vecchio. But after that, the field is open and the fundamentals are clear.On my way back to London, Gorny gave me a lift to the station. “There is nothing close to that firepower once the combination is done,” he said. “You have the global footprint. You can play all the courts.” And I thought about how one of the telling aspects of wearing glasses is that they help you notice everything else – and for the most part, see the world as it actually is – but it is only occasionally, through a chance reflection, or when you really take a moment to stop and look, that you see what is sitting on the top of your nose.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba55381a9adef8dfb531ba85be4da5519c459078/170_0_1707_1024/master/1707.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa00393aa217f8c686b947f6a78574dc","title":"corbyn 20 comes out swinging and floors may with plain english","story":"At PMQs, the Labour leader has a revolutionary plan: ask the questions the country wants answered At some point in the last week the Labour leader has undergone a major reboot. At recent prime minister’s questions Jeremy Corbyn’s main achievement has been to make Theresa May appear less hopeless than she really is by failing to speak in joined-up sentences or asking questions even he couldn’t understand. All the prime minister had to do to survive unscathed was stand up and answer the question she would like to have been asked. Something that even she could just about manage.Corbyn 2.0 had a revolutionary plan. Talk in plain English. Keep things short and sweet. Stick to one subject. Don’t attempt the impossible of thinking on his feet. And ask the questions that everyone in the country wanted answered. He began by highlighting the government’s isions on Brexit. Did she agree with her foreign secretary that her favoured “customs partnership” arrangement was crazy?The prime minister couldn’t cope. May has been through several iterations of her own – no one is entirely sure if we are currently at Maybot 5.0 or Maybot 6.0 – but she has yet to find a system that is passably functional. Rather it seems that each upgrade only serves to further weaken her. Even though Boris Johnson’s contributions to cabinet collective responsibility had been front page news for a couple of days, she was totally taken aback by the question.“We are leaving the European Union and we are leaving the customs union,” she said, playing for time as so often before by offering nothing that advanced the public understanding of anything. It’s becoming clearer by the day why the government has made so little progress in its Brexit negotiations. It’s not just that no one can agree on what it is they want, but that every new development seems to take the cabinet completely by surprise. Michel Barnier must have more enlightening conversations with his grandchildren.Corbyn relaxed into his script. No deviation, no repetition, no hesitation. The Labour backbenchers couldn’t believe what they were hearing. The best response they can normally muster for their leader is a passive-aggressive silence, but now some were actively encouraging him. Their man was successfully embarrassing the prime minister by simply stating the obvious. The government was committed to working on two solutions to the customs union that both the government and EU agreed were unworkable and unacceptable. You’d be pushed to come up with a better definition of clueless.“We are leaving the customs union,” the Maybot said again as her computer crashed and she burned. By the time the exchanges between the two leaders came to an end, she was just a mess of wires and smoking silicon chips with a disembodied voice, both shrill and brittle, begging someone to unplug her. On days like this, it is hard to see how she can remain in the job. Or how she could even want to. It feels as if it’s only the pressure coming at her from all sides that is stopping her falling apart.With John Bercow away at Michael Martin’s funeral, it was deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle who was left to preside over the proceedings. Taking his cue from Corbyn’s one-line questions, Hoyle moved things along at a nice clip, putting a stop to the braying with a simple hand gesture and keeping the odd outburst of Tory sycophancy to a minimum. PMQs was all wrapped up in under 40 minutes and the MPs roared their approval. Then, they would have done so if he’d let it run for over an hour. Not being John Bercow is more than enough to raise the roof in some quarters.Boris Johnson had managed to prove his loyalty to May by refraining from heckling her – being so jet-lagged he could hardly keep his eyes open must have helped – but once she had left the chamber it was his turn at the dispatch box to explain how his one-man mission to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel peace prize had ended with the US president canning the Iran nuclear deal. It wasn’t his finest hour, but even he seemed surprised that so many of his own MPs, including former defence secretary Michael Fallon, were so quick to hail Trump’s genius. With just a hint of Boris being in charge, the lunatics really are taking over the asylum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/886eba511679e2986d12a8465f013701089e8127/160_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8638a7464f205df55f731f1494fd793b","title":"nasa moon mars missions jim bridenstine","story":"Two missions ‘are supportive of each other’, says agency’s new head after Trump signed directive aimed at returning to moonThe US effort to return to the moon will not undermine its mission to be the first country to put a human on Mars, the new head of Nasa insisted on Wednesday.In December, Donald Trump signed a policy directive instructing Nasa to send astronauts back to the moon, half a century after Neil Armstrong became the first person to set foot there. Last week, Nasa issued a draft request for a proposal encouraging the US commercial space industry to help it deliver payloads to the moon.But in one of his first major speeches as Nasa administrator, Jim Bridenstine sought to reassure Mars enthusiasts that the red planet is still on the agenda.“If some of you are concerned that our focus in the coming years is the moon, don’t be,” he told the annual Humans to Mars summit in Washington. “The president’s vision has emphasised that our exploration campaign will establish American leadership in the human exploration of Mars. We are doing both the moon and Mars in tandem and the missions are supportive of each other.”Bridenstine added: “In fact, our return to the surface of the moon will allow us to prove and advance technologies that will feed forward to Mars: precision landing systems, methane engines, orbital habitation, surface habitation, surface mobility, long duration life support operations and much more that will enable us to land the first Americans on the red planet.”Short-term plans include the Mars 2020 rover, a car-sized vehicle that will look for signs of habitable conditions on Mars. Planned for launch in July or August 2020, the rover can collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils and set them aside with a view to a future mission potentially returning them to earth.The three-day summit, where the year 2033 features prominently as a target date for a manned mission to Earth’s neighbour, boasts virtual reality demonstrations and 111 speakers including Vera Mulyani, who has been dubbed a “Marschitect”. Her company, Mars City Design, explores ideas of sustainable urban planning on the planet including homes where residents can “live and love”. Its website displays proposals for an “extreme greenhouse habitat”, “terraforming of Mars” and self-cleaning Martian clothes – made from a fabric of pulverised starch polymer with “a bacteria colony” that can absorb sweat.Despite growing geopolitical rivalry with China and Russia, the US does not face an urgent space race as it once did with the Soviet Union. Even so, some politicians stress the importance of the US reaching Mars first.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, chairman of the space subcommittee of the Senate commerce committee, told the summit: “The first foot that sets foot on Mars will be an American foot, and an American explorer. That’s leadership that I think this country needs and values. Restoring America’s leadership in space I think is incredibly important.”The nomination of Bridenstine, a Republican congressman from Oklahoma, was controversial among Democrats, but Cruz suggested that space was one of the few areas where the parties still worked together.Noting the bipartisan passage of legislation in 2015 and 2017, Cruz added: “This is a partisan, polarised time in Washington. That is lost on nobody. D’s and R’s, it seems, fight like cats and dogs over just about everything. But here’s a bit of good news. One of the very few exceptions concerns space ... Every Democrat and every Republican on the same page saying man will go to Mars.”Cruz also reflected on his state’s deep involvement in space programmes. “As a Texan I take particular joy that the first word spoken on the moon was ‘Houston’. You win a lot of trivial contests with that. ‘Houston, the Eagle has landed.’ As a Houstonian, that makes me very happy.”(Similar claims have been made in the past by Texas politicians and found to be false by the Politifact website, which noted that the first words spoken after the lunar module touched down were “contact light”, “shutdown” and other language from a technical checklist.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6555b5ec10d71895ce8ab3bf5110caf27e4820e/0_40_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fab0391de9270c1b50f93f463ee4f3c","title":"how oregon grew too much marijuana to sell","story":"Oregon farmers have grown three times what their customers can smoke in a year, causing bud prices to plummet and panic to set inA recent Sunday afternoon at the Bridge City Collective cannabis shop in north Portland saw a steady flow of customers.Little wonder: a gram of weed was selling for less than the price of a glass of wine.The $4 and $5 grams enticed Scotty Saunders, a 24-year-old sporting a gray hoodie, to spend $88 picking out new products to try with a friend. “We’ve definitely seen a huge drop in prices,” he says.Across the wood and glass counter, Bridge City owner David Alport was less delighted. He says he’s never sold marijuana this cheap before.“We have standard grams on the shelf at $4,” Alport says. “Before, we didn’t see a gram below $8.”The scene at Bridge City Collective is playing out across the city and state. Three years into Oregon’s era of recreational cannabis, the state is inundated with legal weed.It turns out Oregonians are good at growing cannabis – too good.In February, state officials announced that 1.1m pounds of cannabis flower were logged in the state’s database.If a million pounds sounds like a lot of pot, that’s because it is: last year, Oregonians smoked, vaped or otherwise consumed just under 340,000lb of legal bud.That means Oregon farmers have grown three times what their clientele can smoke in a year.Yet state documents show the number of Oregon weed farmers is poised to double this summer – without much regard to whether there’s demand to fill.The result? Prices are dropping to unprecedented lows in auction houses and on dispensary counters across the state.Wholesale sun-grown weed fell from $1,500 a pound last summer to as low as $700 by mid-October. On store shelves, that means the price of sun-grown flower has been sliced in half to those four-buck grams.For Oregon customers, this is a bonanza. A gram of the beloved Girl Scout Cookies strain now sells for little more than two boxes of actual Girl Scout cookies.But it has left growers and sellers with a high-cost product that’s a financial loser. And a new feeling has descended on the once-confident Oregon cannabis industry: panic.“The business has been up and down and up and down,” says Don Morse, who closed his Human Collective II dispensary in south-west Portland four months ago. “But in a lot of ways it has just been down and down for dispensaries.”This month, WW spoke to two dozen people across Oregon’s cannabis industry. They describe a bleak scene: small businesses laying off employees and shrinking operations. Farms shuttering. People losing their life’s savings are unable to declare bankruptcy because marijuana is still a federally scheduled narcotic.To be sure, every new market creates winners and losers. But the glut of legal weed places Oregon’s young industry in a precarious position, and could swiftly reshape it.Oregon’s wineries, breweries and distilleries have experienced some of the same kind of shakeout over time. But the timetable is faster with pot: for many businesses, it’s boom to bust within months.Mom-and-pop farms are accepting lowball offers to sell to out-of-state investors, and what was once a erse – and local – market is increasingly owned by a few big players. And frantic growers face an even greater temptation to illegally leak excess grass across state lines – and into the crosshairs of US attorney general Jeff Sessions’ justice department.“If somebody has got thousands of pounds that they can’t sell, they are desperate,” says Myron Chadowitz, who owns the Eugene farm Cannassentials. “Desperate people do desperate things.”In March, Robin Cordell posted a distress signal on Instagram.“The prices are so low,” she wrote, “and without hustling all day, hoping to find the odd shop with an empty jar, it doesn’t seem to move at any price.”Cordell has a rare level of visibility for a cannabis grower. Her Oregon City farm, Oregon Girl Gardens, received glowing profiles from Dope Magazine and Oregon Leaf. She has 12 years of experience in the medical marijuana system, a plot of family land in Clackamas county, and branding as one of the state’s leaders in organic and women-led cannabis horticulture.She fears she’ll be out of business by the end of the year.“The prices just never went back up,” she says.Cordell ran headlong into Oregon’s catastrophically bountiful cannabis crop.The Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) handed out dozens of licenses to new farmers who planted their first crop last spring. Mild weather blessed the summer of 2017 and stretched generously into the fall. And growers going into their second summer season planted extra seeds to make up for flower lost to a 2016 storm, the last vestige of a brutal typhoon blown across the Pacific from Asia.“That storm naturally constrained the supply even though there were a lot of cultivators,” says Beau Whitney, senior economist for New Frontier Data, which studies the cannabis industry.It kept supply low and prices high in 2017 – even though the state was handing out licenses at an alarming rate.“It was a hot new market,” Whitney says. “There weren’t a whole lot of barriers to entry. The OLCC basically issued a license to anyone who qualified.”Chadowitz blames out-of-state money for flooding the Oregon system. In 2016, state lawmakers decided to lift a restriction that barred out-of-state investors from owning controlling shares of local farms and dispensaries.It was a controversial choice – one that many longtime growers still resent.“The root of the entire thing was allowance of outside money into Oregon,” Chadowitz says. “Anyone could get the money they needed. Unlimited money and unlimited licenses, you’re going to get unlimited flower and crash the market.”As of 1 April, Oregon had licensed 963 recreational cannabis grows, while another 910 awaited OLCC approval.That means oversupply is only going to increase as more farms start harvesting bud.The OLCC has said repeatedly that it has no authority to limit the number of licenses it grants to growers, wholesalers and dispensaries (although by contrast, the number of liquor stores in Oregon is strictly limited).Since voters legalized recreational marijuana in 2014, many industry veterans from the medical marijuana years have chafed at the entrance of new money, warning it would destroy a carefully crafted farm ecosystem.The OLCC remains committed to facilitating a free market for recreational marijuana in which anyone can try their hand at growing or selling.The demand for weed in Oregon is robust – the state reeled in $68m in cannabis sales taxes last year – but it can’t keep pace with supply.Whitney says it’s not unusual for a new industry to attract speculators and people without much business savvy.“Whenever you have these emerging markets, there’s going to be a lot of people entering the market looking for profit,” he says. “Once it becomes saturated, it becomes more competitive. This is not a phenomenon that is unique to cannabis. There used to be a lot of computer companies, but there’s not so many anymore.”Across rolling hills of Oregon farmland and in Portland dispensaries as sleek as designer eyewear shops, the story plays out the same: Business owners can’t make the low prices pencil out.Nick Duyck is a second-generation farmer and owner of 3D Blueberry Farms in Washington county. “I was born and raised on blueberries,” he says.But last June, Duyck launched Private Reserve Cannabis, a weed grow designed to create permanent jobs for seasonal workers.“By starting up the cannabis business,” says Duyck, “it keeps my guys busy on a year-round basis.”He invested $250,000 in the structural build-outs, lighting, environmental controls and other initial costs to achieve a 5,000 sq ft, Tier I, OLCC-approved indoor canopy.Ongoing labor and operational costs added another $20,000 a month.Weed prices were high: Duyck forecast a $1,500 return per pound. If Duyck could produce 20lb of flower a week, he’d make back his money and start banking profits in just three months.October’s bumper crop tore those plans apart.“We got in at the wrong time,” Duyck says. “The outdoor harvest flooded the market.”By the start of the new year, Duyck was sitting on 100lb of ready-to-sell flower – an inventory trickling out to dispensaries in single-pound increments.So he turned to a wholesaler, Cannabis Auctions LLC, which holds monthly fire sales in various undisclosed locations throughout Oregon.Weed auctions operate under a traditional model: sellers submit their wares, and buyers – dispensary owners, intake managers and extract manufacturers – are given an opportunity to inspect products before bidding on parcels awarded to the highest dollar.Duyck sent 60lb of pot to the auction block in December. He had adjusted his expectations downward: he hoped to see something in the ballpark of $400 a pound.It sold for $100 a pound.“The price per pound that it costs us to raise this product is significantly higher than the hundred dollars a pound,” says Duyck. (A little light math points to a $250-per-unit production cost.) “Currently, we’re operating at a $15,000-per-month loss,” Duyck says.If prices don’t improve soon, Duyck says he won’t be able to justify renewing his OLCC license for another year.“The dispensaries that are out there, a lot of them have their own farms, so they don’t buy a lot of product from small farms like us’” Duyck says. “If you really want to grow the product, you almost have to own the store also.”Middlemen – store owners without farms – are also suffering. Take Don Morse, who gave up selling weed on New Year’s Eve.Morse ran Human Collective II, one of the earliest recreational shops in the city, which first opened as a medical marijuana supplier in 2010. At times, Morse stocked 100 strains in his Multnomah Village location.Morse lobbied for legal recreational weed and founded the Oregon Cannabis Business Council.The shift to recreational was costly. With his business partner Sarah Bennett, Morse says he invested more than $100,000 in equipment to meet state regulations.By last summer, new stores were popping up at a rapid pace. Morse’s company wasn’t vertically integrated, which means it did not grow any of its own pot or run a wholesaler that might have subsidized low sales.“Competition around us was fierce, and the company started losing money, and it wasn’t worth it anymore,” Morse says. “At our peak, we had 20 employees. When we closed, we had six.”Morse couldn’t see a way to make the numbers work. Human Collective priced grams as low as $6 to compete with large chains like Nectar and Chalice, but it struggled to turn a profit.“When you’re the little guy buying the product from wholesalers, you can’t afford to compete,” he says. “There’s only so far you can lower the price. There’s too much of everything and too many people in the industry.”So Morse closed his shop: “We paid our creditors and that was that. That was the end of it.”Despite losing his business, Morse stands behind Oregon’s light touch when it comes to regulating the industry.“It’s just commercialism at its finest,” he says. “Let the best survive. That’s just the way it goes in capitalism. That’s just the way it goes.”Just as mom-and-pop grocery stores gave way to big chains, people like Morse are losing out to bigger operations.Chalice Farms has five stores in the Portland area and is opening a sixth in Happy Valley. La Mota has 15 dispensaries. Nectar has 11 storefronts in Oregon, with four more slated to open soon.Despite the record-low prices in the cannabis industry, these chains are hiring and opening new locations, sometimes after buying failed mom-and-pop shops.The home page on Nectar’s website prominently declares: “Now buying dispensaries! Please contact us if you are a dispensary owner interested in selling your business.”Nectar representatives did not respond to a request for comment.Because the federal government does not recognize legal marijuana, the industry cannot access traditional banking systems or even federal courts. That means business owners can’t declare bankruptcy to dissolve a failed dispensary or farm, leaving them with few options. They can try to liquidate their assets, destroy the product they have on hand and eat the losses.Or they can sell the business to a company like Nectar, often for a fraction of what they’ve invested.Deep-pocketed companies can survive the crash and wait for the market to contract again.Oregon faces another consequence of pot businesses closing up shop: leftover weed could end up on the black market.Already, Oregon has a thriving illegal market shipping to other states.US attorney for Oregon, Billy Williams, has said he has little interest in cracking down on legal marijuana businesses, but will prosecute those shipping marijuana to other states.“That kind of thing is what’s going to shut down our industry,” Chadowitz says. “Anything we can do to prevent Jeff Sessions from being right, we have to do.”Ask someone in the cannabis industry what to do about Oregon’s weed surplus, and you’re likely to get one of three answers.The first is to cap the number of licenses awarded by the OLCC. The second is to reduce the canopy size allotted to each license – Massachusetts is trying that. And the last, equally common answer is to simply do nothing. Let the market sort itself out.Farmers, such as Walker of East Fork Cultivars, argue that limiting the number of licensed farms in Oregon would stunt the state’s ability to compete on the national stage in the years ahead.“We’re in this sort of painful moment right now,” says Walker, “but I think if we let it be a painful moment, and not try to cover it up, we’re going to be better off for it.”Walker and other growers hope selling across state lines will someday become legal.Every farmer, wholesaler, dispensary owner and economist WW talked to for this story said that if interstate weed sales became legal, Oregon’s oversupply problem would go away.Under the current presidential administration, that might seem a long shot. But legalization is sweeping the country, Donald Trump is signaling a looser approach, and experts say Oregon will benefit when the feds stop fighting.“The thing about Oregon is that it is known for its cannabis, in a similar way to Oregon pinot noir,” Whitney says. “For those who are able to survive, they are positioned extremely well not only to survive in the Oregon market but also to take advantage of a larger market – assuming things open up on a federal level.”Looking for more great work from the Portland, Oregon, alt-weekly paper and website Willamette Week?

With this paper comes an admission from the governing body’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, that the sport has previously fallen short.“Cricket is a force for good in society and our job is to ensure that it makes a positive impact on as many people’s lives as possible,” said Harrison. “While we’ve long acknowledged the passion for the game in south Asian communities and had the best intentions, we have never fully understood how to engage with them. This report gives us a road map to change that.”The rule was named after the former Pittsburgh Steelers chairman Dan Rooney, who was behind the introduction of a similar policy for the NFL in 2003. It will ensure at least one BAME candidate who meets the application criteria for any ECB coaching job will be interviewed and follows a similar move by the Football Association in January. In addition, 10 south Asian coaches will be given mentoring and work placements in the next two years.Moeen Ali, who in 2016 was part of an England Test team that for the first time included four British Asians, along with Haseeb Hameed, Zafar Ansari and Adil Rashid, said: “Growing up in inner‑city Birmingham, I fully understand some of the challenges and barriers for young south Asian cricketers. I see many of those challenges now when I help my dad coach at his cricket academy. Many parents are still struggling to afford kit for their kids and the new bursaries will give emerging players the opportunity to continue to improve and develop in the game.”Another target in the “core cities” will be to establish female-only cricket sessions for the south Asian community, with 200 female coaches deployed, after the ECB’s research showed a lack of such opportunities to be another concern. Soft-ball women’s leagues will also be established in these areas.The ECB is also seeking to address why the recreational numbers are not reflected in first-class professional squads. The governing body will increase mentoring, offer assistance with education outside of cricket and deliver a programme of unconscious bias training for academy directors to tackle drop-offs from the youth intake.The match experience is to be tailored in a way that opens up the sport to all, with halal and vegetarian food options, flexible family ticket offers and multi-faith prayer facilities at all major venues. Both the 2019 World Cup and the ECB’s new 100-ball tournament, which starts in 2020, will also be heavily marketed towards the south Asian community.Lord Patel said: “As a British Asian who grew up playing cricket in the streets and on the pitches of Bradford in the 1960s, I have first-hand experience of the enormous benefits of our sport. Cricket gave me the confidence, connections and opportunities to meet new people outside my community, as well as develop life-long friendships.“The passion south Asian communities in the UK have for cricket remains high but, over 50 years later, there is still so much untapped potential. This plan will help to change that – starting today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cb3c190325ca051426a4eb2cae3b56625926caa/165_66_1608_965/master/1608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21287fd6bcd4d8d8426ad16a3e235728","title":"leinster dan leavy european champions cup racing 92","story":"As Eddie Jones ponders his options at openside flanker for the summer tour to South Africa, England’s head coach could be excused for reflecting on Ireland, whose fourth choice in the position at the start of the season enjoyed a standout Six Nations and has spearheaded Leinster’s push to the European Champions Cup final.Dan Leavy started the campaign with three caps, all off the bench, after making his debut against Canada in November 2016. He was behind Sean O’Brien, who had been an integral part of the British \u0026amp Irish Lions’ drawn series in New Zealand, Josh van\u0026nbspder\u0026nbspFlier and Jordi Murphy, but injuries thrust a player who turns 24 this month into the limelight. He has yet to blink.His Leinster and Ireland colleague James Ryan this season described the flanker as “someone who throws his head into anything”. Leavy’s face bears testimony to that, sporting the scars of someone who has gone the distance in the boxing ring.“If you are second-guessing yourself as a seven going for the ball you are going to hurt yourself,” he says. “You are either all in or you are out. It might look dangerous to some people but it is the way I always have been, particularly when I go for a ball.”Leinster used him occasionally on the blindside last season because of the options they had at seven – Murphy is leaving for Ulster in the summer – but Leavy sees himself as a breakaway, close to the ball, linking in attack and devastating in defence, an all-action forward.“The Leinster brand of rugby is a tough defence and an attack that throws the ball around,” says Leavy, who started the final four matches of the Six Nations this year having replaced the injured Van\u0026nbspder\u0026nbspFlier in the first half of the opener in Paris. “The culture here is all about winning. I remember Leinster’s past successes in Europe and you try to live up to that standard.”Leinster face Racing\u0026nbsp92 in the final in Bilbao on Saturday aiming to equal Toulouse’s record of winning the tournament four times. They have swept all before them in Europe in a season in which Ireland have won the grand slam while the country will be represented in the Pro14 final at the end of the month with Leinster and Munster meeting in the semi-final in Dublin on 19\u0026nbspMay, chasing a triple crown with a difference.“We were in the Champions Cup semi-final last season and came up short as we did in the Pro14,” says Leavy. “We sat down at the end of it and said we were not happy at the way it had gone.” Revenge was delivered on the team who had knocked them out of the league play-offs, the Scarlets, in the Champions Cup semi-final last month when Leinster’s domination was barely reflected in the 38-16 scoreline.“It was a weird feeling in the dressing room afterwards because we knew there was another gear in us,” says Leavy. “We knew there was more in us, another level to reach and we will need to find it against Racing. They are an incredible team with a number of top names and big match experience. They were finalists in 2016 and won the Top\u0026nbsp14 that year. It will take a special effort to break them and we are aware of that.”Leavy acknowledges the difference the former England head coach Stuart Lancaster has made since joining Leinster’s coaching team in September 2016. “He has been fantastic,” says the flanker. “He revolutionised the way we trained and the standards we set. We train at a high intensity and if you work hard you test yourself mentally. That comes through in matches.“When he first came in he told us how we needed to change if we were to evolve as a team. He was very confident and sure in his ways. We have huge faith in him: he has told us what to do and when we do it we win.“We are well aware how expensive it is for our supporters to get to Bilbao and we fully appreciate the efforts they make. When you come to Leinster as a youngster, you see pictures of the successful sides of the past on the wall. You want to join them and we have the chance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d4ec62557ebb5c130a1f8f3cc7f31c35f45b9cc/976_673_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f61ee0b42f9c9f7a19e1c4126489392d","title":"hawaiis evacuees on life by the volcano people think were crazy to live here","story":"As the Kilauea volcano erupts, Puna district residents reflect on the threat to an area of affordable housing – and great beautyAs the Kilauea volcano erupts, Puna district residents reflect on the threat to an area of affordable housing – and great beautyImago Mana had always wanted move to Hawaii. But it was mostly a dream for the computer technology teacher from Virginia, who put it in the back of her mind.“I always thought: I can’t do that now, Hawaii is too expensive.” Then, around the age of 50, she began getting debilitating migraines. She lost her job, her house, her car. She moved back in with her mother. As she was trying to figure out what to do next, a friend told her about a part of Hawaii where life was a little different, a little wilder. In the district of Puna, Mana found a raw vegan commune where she could work in exchange for living in an off-the-grid hut on 50 acres of jungle. She bought a one-way ticket and boarded a plane four days later.“The minute I got off the plane I knew I was home,” Mana said.Mana, now 59, has since moved out of the commune and was among those evacuated on Thursday because of the continuing eruptions of the looming Kilauea volcano. Dramatic videos of lava slowly pouring through streets and inching over the land have attracted international attention.Mana has lived in the Leilani Estates subision, which is located in Pahoa, for three years rent-free as a caretaker. It’s one of the reasons she has been able to live on her $1,400-a-month disability checks. Now, she’s one of many trying to replace the affordable housing she lost in Pahoa – where many depend on the low cost of living. In exchange for living in the lava zone, often without infrastructure such as city water or sewer lines, she and others have been able to make a life for themselves without much money.Puna district and the town of Pahoa, where homes have been destroyed by lava, are among the least expensive places to live in the islands. It’s common for three-bedroom, two-bath houses on an acre of land to sell for around $250,000, according to Cathy Fedak, a realtor from Pahoa who also lived in Leilani Estates.“There are a lot of literally starving artists here,” said Amedeo Markoff, who opened the Puna Gallery and Gift Emporium in March to sell handcrafted wood pieces and local art. Markoff added that with news of the volcano scaring off tourists, a community where many struggle to make ends meet is in even greater peril.Markoff said for the residents, businesses and artists, affordable housing is key.“There are a lot of reasons why people want to live in Puna,” he said “But the No 1 reason is the beauty. The No 2 reason is that real estate is priced so that your average Joe can live here.”That’s certainly the case for Corey Hale, who came to Pahoa from California nearly four years ago and purchased a one-acre plot of land just outside Leilani Estates for $15,000.Hale, who is 54 and a former crisis counselor, intended to build a house on her thickly forested jungle plot at some point, but needed to wait until she got the money together. In the meantime, she lived in a “gypsy wagon” given to her by a neighbor, went to work fixing leaks and building an outdoor shower out of old wood pallets, and lit oil lamps to see at night.But having her own land and an inexpensive off-the-grid lifestyle became even more important when she became disabled and saw her monthly income reduced to $340 in food stamps and $338 in cash. Luckily, Hale said, she never went hungry because of the abundance of avocado, mango, papaya and banana trees around her property.“I created a really good life for myself,” she said. “It was simple, but it was good – life is messy here, but it’s real and it’s beautiful.” Hale, who was evacuated on Thursday, said she hoped she’d be able to return home soon. For now, she’s staying at a Red Cross shelter in Pahoa. She’s been reluctant to make plans because no one knows how long the eruption will continue or how long residents will be kept out of their neighborhoods. And on Tuesday, just as things had become quiet, Hale got another shock when two new volcanic fissures opened up near her property. She fears that even if she can return, the eruption will have changed the place she knew and loved.“With lava, after it’s gone, it’s like you come back to a different planet,” she said. “I had to say goodbye to my land when I left, and my heart hurts.” Henrietta “Kaonohiokalani” Jeremiah, a musician, retiree and native Hawaiian, also lives in Leilani Estates and is waiting to see if and when she will be able to go back home. She purchased her one-acre plot of land for about $20,000, then built a multi-sided home, similar to a yurt, on the property.For her, she said, living in Pahoa offed the chance to have a deep, spiritual relationship with the land, far away from the more urbanized parts of the islands. Despite the current crisis, she said, living in the area with other artists has made life a rich and shared experience.Markoff said he was growing a bit weary of the way the disaster has been treated in the news.“There’s an idea that people are crazy to live here,” he said. “But many people grew up here and have been here their whole lives.” Plus, he said, the area is a melting pot that still feels like the old Hawaii, far away from the development that has dramatically changed other parts of the islands. And, he said, even the volcano has a certain magnetism.“It’s pretty amazing to be so close to new land being made,” he said. “It’s a very powerful thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c69bf47eb0a2a8270f3f25a012c0943b9ee7aa7d/0_146_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc61d883bdc918df48d037ddd4d07d27","title":"payments to michael cohen show how shadow lobbying eludes us law","story":"Cohen has said he provided consultancy services rather than lobbying, and is not required by law to register as a lobbyist and disclose paymentsThe disclosure that Donald Trump’s legal fixer Michael Cohen was quietly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to advise corporations highlights the inability of US laws to prevent secretive “shadow lobbying”, analysts said.Companies such as the telecoms giant AT\u0026ampT and Novartis, a major pharmaceuticals firm, confirmed they paid Cohen, the president’s personal attorney, large sums last year in return for what they describe as guidance on navigating the new administration.As Cohen said he provided consultancy services rather than lobbying, which involves directly advocating for a client to government officials, he was not required under US law to register as a lobbyist and disclose the payments in public filings.Cohen and his attorney, Stephen Ryan, did not respond to requests for comment on the arrangements. Federal authorities in New York have said Cohen, 51, is the subject of a criminal investigation relating to his personal business and financial affairs. No allegation has been made relating to Cohen’s consultancy work.Professor James Thurber of American University, who has researched lobbying for decades, said it was too easy for influential people in Washington to make money around the legislative process without informing the public, in what is loosely termed shadow lobbying. “If someone is trying to influence government policy and is getting paid for it, they should register,” said Thurber, who said that as well as being fundamentally weak, the Lobbying Disclosure Act was also not enforced aggressively enough.“You get paid to tell the client how to lobby, or what the important people are thinking, or who to call on what topic,” said Daniel Auble, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics. “Anything like this is allowed without disclosure.”AT\u0026ampT employs a small army of registered lobbyists to advocate for it on Capitol Hill, in Trump’s White House and at agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission. The company has spent more than $28m on federal lobbying in 2017 and 2018, according to congressional filings.But the company has confirmed it also paid Cohen’s company Essential Consultants for “insights into understanding the new administration” beginning in early 2017, when Trump was inaugurated. AT\u0026ampT paid Cohen $200,000 in four installments, according to a document published by an attorney for Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic actor known as Stormy Daniels, who is battling Trump and Cohen in the courts.Trump’s administration was last year considering whether to allow an $85bn merger of AT\u0026ampT and Time Warner. The Justice Department announced in November that it would seek to block the merger, a decision that the companies are fighting in court. The administration was also working on reforms to rules on net neutrality that directly affect AT\u0026ampT.Henry Su, a former attorney for the Federal Trade Commission and now a partner at Constantine Cannon in Washington, said it was unusual for a company to approach someone closely linked to an incoming administration so quickly and directly.“Typically a company will wait for the administration to be in place. There are official channels to do this, usually through the transition team,” he said, adding that the Essential Consultants setup “looks more and more like the swamp Trump said he was going to drain”.While the extent of shadow lobbying is by its nature difficult to quantify, ethics campaigners and others have pointed to a steadily declining number of official lobbyists as proof that influence is increasingly being pushed in secret.Having reached a modern-day peak of 14,824 in 2007, the number of registered lobbyists had by last month fallen to 9,443, according to congressional records, following some tightening of the rules under Barack Obama’s administration.Paul Miller, president of the National Institute For Lobbying \u0026amp Ethics, a lobbying trade group, said of this decline in numbers last year: “The simple reality is people are reclassifying what they do as not direct lobbying and thus they are no longer covered by the Lobbying Disclosure Act.”Two other companies that paid Cohen have in recent years decided against paying registered lobbyists to advocate for them in Washington. According to public filings, Columbus Nova has not done so since paying McGuireWoods $16,000 in 2010 to lobby on business regulations.Columbus Nova is the US affiliate of a corporate empire belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch closely linked to Vladimir Putin. The company confirmed it hired Cohen “as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures” and said Vekselberg was not involved. Avenatti said the company paid Cohen almost half a million dollars.Meanwhile Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), one of South Korea’s biggest defence companies, confirmed it had paid Cohen for “legal consulting concerning accounting standards”. Avenatti’s document said KAI, which is competing for a Pentagon contract, paid Cohen $150,000 in November last year.KAI has not used a registered lobbyist in Washington since paying American Defense International $20,000 in February 2002, according to congressional filings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d3f75fd937b82e38bb01ba62a2e83926fca0e73/0_313_5616_3371/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29274541de296f53a5d01e11ae7c0afc","title":"british columbia canada human feet mystery","story":"Since 2007, 14 human feet clad in running shoes have been found on the shores of British ColumbiaBritish Columbia, Canada is known for many things: beautiful landscapes, great skiing, the 2010 Winter Olympics – and the human feet that have been washing up on its shores for the last nine years.Since 2007, 14 human feet clad in running shoes have been found on the shores of British Columbia, from Jedediah Island to Botanical Beach. So far, the provincial coroner’s office has identified eight of the 12. Of those eight, there were two pairs. The remaining lone feet, the coroner determined, belonged to men.Between 2012 and 2016, there was a four-year pause between sightings. Then on 7 February a new one washed ashore, discovered by a hiker along Vancouver Island’s Botanical Beach. Five days later, another one appeared. The coroner’s office confirmed they were a pair.After so many years, the arrival of human feet no longer provokes concern in the province. But when they first started to appear in 2007, speculation about where they came from ran rampant and pranksters even planted fake feet on the shores, just to add fuel to the fire.“We’ve had people put dog foot skeletons in runners and leave them on the beach,” Barb McLintock, who works at the coroner’s office, told the  in 2016. “And somebody even used old chicken bones.”Since the first foot was discovered, theories about the feet have been numerous and creative. In 2008, a Toronto Star article said that “speculation ranges from natural disasters, such as the tsunami of 2004, to the work of drug dealers, serial killers and human traffickers”. In 2008, the man who found the fifth foot told the  he suspected foul play: “There’s someone doing this all right. Think about it, if they tied a chain around someone’s ankle and threw them overboard, the foot would just pop off. That could explain it. Maybe they got a lot of bodies stored up in a container and they got washed out. We don’t know. There’s a lot of stuff goes on over there,” he said.But McLintock said this was not the work of a serial killer or the result of alien abductions. The coroner’s office has ruled that all of the identified iniduals committed suicide or died accidentally, most likely due to storms near the coast.After several years and a dozen cases, McLintock said their work suggests the feet are separating from the bodies during decomposition. This occurs more quickly underwater than it would on land.“The forensic anthropologists can be really sure of that because they can tell looking at the ends of the bones whether they disarticulated naturally or whether there’s any sign that any mechanical force has been applied to them, whether there’s any trauma, whether there’s any tool marks on them,” she said. “And none of them have had anything like that. All the evidence is pointed to just this natural articulation process.”But some people still have questions – for example, why did the feet only start turning up after 2007? The answer may be advancing shoe technology. More and more sports shoes are using air pockets or light foam in their designs, which “eventually allows them to be light enough to float and to wash up on shore”.The coast of British Columbia sees many of these cases because of tide and current patterns, according to McLintock. And while the odd foot pops up elsewhere in the world – for example, several have come ashore in Washington state – British Columbia remains in the spotlight. But McLintock has no doubt that this occurs worldwide, and not just on her coast.“Presumably there probably are a bunch of running shoes bouncing around out there,” she said. “But no one’s ever going to find them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f3b846b29293f39e1840a9ad6a8f5d191b21f1f/0_179_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=771146b2ce9903bb1ee1c6f9909c763e","title":"malaysia election confusion as rival questions mahathirs right to be sworn in","story":"Confirmation as prime minister thrown into doubt, with defeated incumbent Najib Razak allegedly offering inducements for MPs to switch sidesThe election of Mahathir Mohamad as Malaysia’s new leader has been thrown into doubt after his rival Najib Razak refused to concede defeat and was allegedly offering opposition candidates $6m to switch sides.It was presumed that the election results, which saw a historic win for the opposition for the first time in 60 years, would make way for Mahathir, who this year switched to the opposition party, to return to power.However, Mahathir’s confirmation faced setbacks on Thursday morning, with reports that the king was refusing to swear him in and that Najib was attempting to swing the election his way by buying up candidates in the state of Sabah.There was also a suggestion that, according to the constitution, Mahathir was not even eligible to be prime minister because the opposition coalition is not technically one party.The party that got the most seats was PKR, which is led by the wife of former prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, and there were reports she would be named prime minister instead.However, speaking on Thursday morning Mahathir attempted to put all doubts to rest about whether he would be prime minister and said he would be forming a government by the evening.Dr Mahathir Mohamad was Malaysia\u0027s longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 1981 to 2003. He is credited with overseeing a period of economic growth but was also notoriously authoritarian, cracking down on the opposition, the judiciary and the press. Mahathir selected Abdullah Badawi as his successor, but toppled him in 2009 after a poor election performance and installed another protege, Najib Razak, as prime minister.Having officially retired, Mahathir then denounced Najib in 2015, after the 1MDB scandal broke. In 2018, it was announced he had switched to the opposition party, and, at 92 years old, would be running again as prime minister to bring down Najib. If his win is confirmed, he will be the oldest leader in the world.“Today I want to emphasise that our coalition, Pakatan Harapan, has already won a clear majority and therefore we are invited to form a government. We stand by the rule of law and whatever we do must be governed by the constitution.”He said that according to the constitution “the prime minister should have the support of the majority of the candidates of parliament, it does not say it should have the support of any one party”, and emphasised that all parties in the coalition had signed a letter backing him as the choice for prime minister.“We would like to form the government here, today, because currently there is no government of Malaysia,” said Mahathir. “We hope that at 5o’clock today we will have formed a government.”Multiple reports from the ground in the state of Sabah suggested that on Thursday morning Najib and Barisan Nasional were still offering the candidates from the local Warisan party 20 million ringgit ($6m) to switch sides, though that would still not give them a parliamentary majority.Mahathir, however, insisted that Warisan were fully backing the opposition coalition and dismissed the reports from Sabah.Najib, who had been prime minister since 2009, made a speech on Thursday morning saying he accepted “the verdict delivered by the people”. However he did not admit defeat and instead highlighted that no party had achieved a simple majority.“Because no party has gotten a simple majority, therefore the king will be making a decision as to who will be the prime minister,” said Najib.With Mahathir now in power, Najib may also be facing the prospect of being investigated and prosecuted for his role in the 1MDB scandal, where $3.2bn of a Malaysian government fund was embezzled, with $681 allegedly ending up in Najib’s personal bank account and funded a multi-million dollar jewellery spree for his wife. As prime minister Najib cleared himself of any wrongdoing, but Mahathir has repeatedly stated his belief that Najib was involved and pledged to see justice done.Speaking on Thursday, he did not rule out prosecuting Najib. “I am not seeing revenge, we don’t want to punish people but the rule rule of law will be clearly implemented,” he said. “If Najib has done something wrong, then he will have to pay the price.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc341ef48867702e4bc2d3814a67a6ec9d6df4ee/0_54_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4501a31dc8a1bcd1bcc4b1f73b8a6060","title":"now the post is muzzled cambodias free press is gone","story":"There are no reliable sources of information left. Not for ordinary people, diplomats or NGOsThis week the last banner of Cambodia’s independent press was torn down, leaving little more than a bloodied flagpole. The Phnom Penh Post was bought by an investor who demanded a “damaging” article be removed, prompting a mass resignation.With the Post compromised, all that remains is the Khmer Times (a paper denounced by its own former editor-in-chief), Facebook and the odious government mouthpiece Fresh News. There are no reliable sources of information left. Not for the Cambodian people, nor for diplomats and NGOs.The only other reputable newspaper, the Cambodia Daily, was shuttered in September 2017 over a tax dispute many see as politically motivated.The demise of these two papers has ripple effects. The wider world of journalism has lost a key training ground for young journalists, with both publications boasting alumni who would be the pride of most journalism schools. Top editors and journalists from around the world, working at the New York Times, the  and the Atlantic, learned their craft at the Post and Daily. Seasoned Cambodian reporters and photographers now employed by agencies such as Associated Press also started there.I got my start as a journalist when the Phnom Penh Post commissioned some features from me. I arrived in Cambodia as a volunteer for an NGO, but my desire to become a freelance journalist was encouraged by senior editors and well-known correspondents I met at a Mexican restaurant called Cantina in Phnom Penh.Cantina was a watering hole for foreign correspondents and staffers at the Post and Daily. When I arrived there on a Thursday in 2013 I found a welcoming attitude: “You want to be a journalist? Go on and do it then.” After a few months I submitted a freelance feature to the Post. When it ran I was so pleased that I emailed it to my family.Cantina closed in 2015 – it’s a Circle K convenience store now. Also closed is Radio Free Asia. Two RFA reporters were arrested in November and charged with espionage: Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin remain in jail, though no evidence has been brought forward. Their case is similar to that of Australian filmmaker James Ricketson, who is also locked up without evidence. The Post is today running on a skeleton staff after all the foreign reporters resigned on 8 May to protest against the firing of editor-in-chief Key Kimsong the day before for refusing a request by new owner Sivakumar S Ganapathy to take down a “damaging” article. The piece remains online but has since been edited by “Post staff”. The paper’s Cambodian staff can’t walk away so easily as they have families and dependents in a country where money and opportunities are slim.The Post was the last vestige of the journalist community that I found on that day back in 2013. The mentors and friends I found gave me a leg up and helped me forge a career. Sadly it’s been dismantled, harassed and muzzled to consolidate the government’s grip on power. Any Cambodian I have spoken to wants a free a press. They don’t see it as some kind of foreign imposition, as much as their leaders would have you to believe with their rhetoric of “imperialists” telling them how to run a country.Cambodians simply want to say and read what they like without fear. As a white reporter I have more leeway but even this piece I have chosen to write anonymously due to an atmosphere of oppression that people living in liberal democracies thankfully don’t have to deal with.In the destruction of Cambodia’s free press, we have lost one of the last beacons of free speech in south-east Asia. Now all we have is memories of a time when we picked up a copy of the Daily and read the tagline that headed its front page: “All the news without fear or favour.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d591378e39a54eabd36d6da00523c120342a0db/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28e2078ae3b6e34ead912bd950630ffe","title":"organised in montenegro on rise amid claims of gang links to government","story":"Shooting of reporter in leg ‘latest warning for investigators’ as state accused of complicity and ignoring drugs and violenceShortly after sunset on Tuesday evening a man approached Olivera Lakić, an investigative journalist, outside her apartment in Montenegro’s capital, Podgorica, and calmly shot her in the leg from close range. Lakić saw the silhouettes of three men fleeing the scene as she fell to the ground.A tourist paradise of mountains, canyons and an Adriatic coastline, Montenegro also has a serious problem with organised crime. For years the picturesque tranquility has been regularly shattered by car bombs and shootings, and in recent months there has been a spike in the violence.Lakić wrote investigative articles for the newspaper Vijesti about cigarette smuggling, claiming senior police officials were involved in an illegal counterfeit trade. She had received numerous threats because of her work and was assaulted outside her apartment in 2012. Vijesti’s executive editor, Željko Ivanović, who on Wednesday visited Lakić in hospital, where she is recovering, said: “It took her many years to get over that attack, and it was only in the last year that she had started smiling, being optimistic and enjoying her job again.“It was absolutely clear that this was a very professional attack. They could easily have killed her, but instead they wanted to send a message: to her, to all journalists in Montenegro, and maybe to part of the government as well.” Ivanović was joined in his hospital visit by US and EU diplomats, who urged a proper investigation.Montenegro’s prime minister, Duško Marković, ordered a “swift and efficient investigation” into the attack. But, as a rule, such cases have not been solved.For years, Montenegro has been riven by gang violence linked to lucrative drugs and cigarette smuggling routes. Usually the killings take place away from the tourist hotspots, but not always. In 2015 an alleged criminal boss was shot dead on the waterfront promenade in Budva, a coastal town popular with tourists. He was killed by a sniper, who shot him from one of the towers of the old town and made a getaway by speedboat. In March this year two people were killed in a drive-by shooting at a cafe in central Podgorica, and hardly a week has gone by this year without news of a shooting or car bomb somewhere in the country.There are persistent allegations that government figures are linked to the criminal gangs. The country’s president, Milo Đukanović, has been the most powerful politician in the country for nearly 30 years, leading it to independence from Serbia and into Nato last year. Đukanović also said EU integration was a priority, and the country hopes for accession to the bloc in 2025.Critics say Đukanović’s government is forgiven many sins because of his commitment to Nato and European integration amid western fears about Russian influence in the region. Montenegrin authorities said that in 2016 they thwarted a Russian-backed coup attempt aimed at toppling the government and killing Đukanović. “There have been 25 physical attacks on Vijesti journalists or premises in the past decade. And this is the country that is supposedly the most reformed western Balkan country and on its way to EU accession,” said Ivanović. Last month Đukanović attacked Vijesti for promoting “fascist ideas” by criticising his son’s business dealings. On paper the Montenegrin government has a programme to fight organised crime, but local activists say the reality is more complicated.“This state has never had a genuine strategy to fight organised crime,” said Daliborka Uljarević, executive director of a leading Montenegrin NGO, adding that elements of the government had been complicit in criminal networks. “This is not a tango you can dance on equal footing. It captures you, and once you play with organised crime you’re controlled by it.” Journalists have also frequently become targets. Last month a car bomb exploded outside the house of Sead Sadiković, an investigative journalist who lives in the town of Bijelo Polje. Sadiković was at work preparing his weekly television broadcast when the bomb went off. “There were many threats before that, and various provocations as well,” Sadiković told the . “I reported all of them to the prosecution, without any concrete results so far.” He blamed “politically motivated hate mongers who were irritated by my reporting” for the attack, adding: “I don’t know what the authorities will do, but I’m not very optimistic ... whenever someone speaks out in Montenegro, bombs go off or noses are broken.”Omer Šarkić, a 55-year-old employee of the state pension service, who organised a protest in Podgorica last month after the bomb attack on Sadiković, said he was disappointed that only about 100 people went out to protest. “These killings affect everyone in Montenegro, we’re sitting here now and we don’t know if someone might open fire right now,” he said, in an interview at a cafe in central Podogorica. “It’s like a war. First it happens far away from the cities but now it’s getting closer and closer. Ordinary citizens are now in danger but nobody is doing anything about it.”Šarkić blamed political connections to the killings for police inaction. “Montenegro is such a small country that everyone knows each other and we know who the criminals are, but the police apparently are the only people who don’t. The criminals are connected to the government and that’s why everyone is so quiet.”Additional reporting by Una Hajdari"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cork widower happy \u0026lsquoindependent\u0026rsquo reviewer is investigating smear-test scandalSurprise move deprives anti-abortion campaigners of key strategic elementComplex web of links between gang criminals makes killings more likely, garda\u0026iacute sayResearch Lives: Dr Junsi Wang, TCD PhD graduate and Takeda researcherIn the \u0026lsquoColumbian exchange\u0026rsquo, plants, livestock and diseases have as much impact as peopleCar makers and tech firms rely on cobalt mined in Katanga, the unstable province where Irish soldiers were attacked in 1961Simon Harris explores how to hold \u0026lsquobespoke\u0026rsquo inquiry to permit women to testify in publicNational Citizens\u0026rsquo Dialogue on the Future of Europe took place in Dublin on WednesdayIssue raised after reports that three ministers told Cabinet this week they wanted HSE boss to step down\u0026lsquoNo evidence\u0026rsquo to support doubters of cervical cancer preventer\u0026lsquoWe have each other\u0026rsquos mobile numbers,\u0026rsquo says Leo VaradkarOrganisation is working to deal with safeguarding failings, Oireachtas committee toldJanette Lakes alleges Fingal County Council failed to fix leaks in Blanchardstown houseMany of the country\u0026rsquos 31 city and county councils have different registration rulesVaradkar criticises \u0026lsquoextraordinarily inaccurate\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoquite grotesque\u0026rsquo poster imagesDubliner (37) has pleaded not guilty to murder of David Douglas on July 1st, 2016"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3489546.1525891458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister considers public hearings in cervicalcheck investigation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris: “We don’t want to go down a big tribunal route that will go on forever and ever.”  Photograph: Tom HonanMinister for Health Simon Harris is exploring how to hold public hearings during the investigation into false smear testing for the CervicalCheck national screening programme and its failure to tell the affected women.Mr Harris told the Oireachtas health committee that he had made initial inquiries with the Department of Justice about creating a “bespoke” commission of investigation, which are typically held in private, to allow people who want to testify in public.The Government has said that a commission of investigation will follow an initial seven-week scoping inquiry into the scandal that is being chaired by Dr Gabriel Scally, the Belfast-born public health veteran.“Can a commission hold any of its hearing in public? There seems to be a viewpoint that it possibly can at the discretion of the chair,” the Minister told TDs and Senators during his testimony to the committee.Mr Harris was questioned during the lengthy hearing on the Government’s plans to investigate false tests given to 209 women with cervical cancer and how at least 162 of them were not told they were inaccurate.The Government has ruled out a tribunal of inquiry, one of the most public ways of investigating the controversy, preferring instead to hold a commission of investigation that could report more quickly.There was a “legislative conflict” between a “very public” tribunal and a commission of investigation that is “generally not public but quicker”, said Mr Harris, and he was looking at a way of “aligning the two”.“We don’t want to go down a big tribunal route that will go on forever and ever with very sick women involved it is not appropriate,” said the Minister.The scandal came to light due to the refusal of terminally ill Limerick woman Vicky Phelan to sign a confidentiality clause as part of a €2.5 million High Court settlement with US-based Clinical Pathology Laboratories, which missed her cervical cancer during a 2011 smear test carried out by CervicalCheck.Ms Phelan was diagnosed with cancer three years later and a 2014 audit showing her original smear test to be inaccurate was withheld from her by CervicalCheck until September 2017.The 43-year-old mother of two told The  she refused to sign a gagging clause so as to allow other affected women to be told and she still “firmly believed” that the investigation had to be held in public.“I can’t see why they can’t push through legislation for a public type of commission of investigation because the outrage that is evident across the country would justify something to be done in public,” she said.Mr Harris said the Taoiseach has asked the Attorney General to work with the State Claims Agency, which defends litigation against the State, to see if there is a way to allow affected women to avoid a difficult trial and an “adversarial situation”, as Ms Phelan had endured last month, where the liability rests with the US labs.The Minister said the Government would await the findings of the Scally inquiry at the end of June before deciding on a redress scheme to compensate affected women to assess the liability for the State and the labs."},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg   May 9, 2018TV presenter moves to clarify controversial remarks made on his Sunday programme "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3489628.1525897181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach defends lack of communication with theresa may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with British prime minister Theresa May over the past six weeks. Photograph: ReutersYves Herman Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with the British prime minister Theresa May for the past six weeks, despite the ongoing Brexit crisis and the suspended Belfast institutions.Mr Varadkar said that he and Ms May had each other’s mobile numbers and could contact each other whenever they needed to. “Currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and on the various cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union, or a customs union partnership, and how that position might evolve,” he said.A meeting “is under consideration for next week” if they are both in Sofia, Bulgaria at the same time. But “the most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement”. Until then “it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who raised the issue in the Dáil, believed it was probably the only time in the past quarter of a century that leaders on both sides went so long without speaking, particularly during such a period of crisis.He expressed concern at the lack of communication, saying that the absence of the anti-Brexit majority in the North from any major discussions “causes damage every day”.And he said it was very surprising given the threat posed by an absent Northern Executive, and by the British government’s refusal to establish consultation processes with Dublin over the suspension, that the Taoiseach had had no contact with Ms May.Mr Martin, a former minister for foreign affairs, said the British-Irish intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now and the maximum use of the Belfast Agreement was imperative.“Otherwise, elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance and that ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute,” he warned.His call was echoed by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who said that while it was “no silver bullet”, a forum was needed to provide a roadmap.Green party Eamon Ryan said the lack of contact for six weeks was “remarkable” and he called on the Taoiseach to engage with the smaller parties including his own colleagues in the North. “Relying on the big two” – the DUP and Sinn Féin – “is not clever at this time”, Mr Ryan said.The Taoiseach said there was a lot of contact at official and political levels. He told Mr Ryan he welcomed forces in the North other than unionist or nationalist but said they had to have regard to parties’ mandate when organising meetings.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

But the prime minister has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has been cleared of any offence by Malaysia’s attorney general.  We are not seeking revenge, we want to restore the rule of law, Mahathir told reporters, as he declared victory.A win means for Dr Mahathir would make him the world’s oldest elected government leader. But in one of the biggest U-turns of his 70-year career in politics, he has signalled he is ready to hand over power to Anwar Ibrahim, an opposition icon who he sacked as his deputy in the 1990s.Mr Anwar is currently serving time in jail after being convicted of sodomy, in a case his opposition party claim was created to curb their rise in popularity. He will be released in June.Mr Najib said he accepted the will of the people.I accept the verdict of the people, the leader, who looked shattered after his coalition\u0027s defeat, said.But he did not make a clear concession, and added that it was up to the nation\u0027s king to decide who would become the next prime minister as no single party had won a majority parliament.Analysts warned he could be trying to buy time to win defections from other parties over to his Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, in what would be a desperate bid to cling to power despite a landslide defeat.Despite the shock result there were no reports of trouble on the streets, where pockets of celebration erupted overnight.A flag-waving crowd of supporters gathered on a field outside the headquarters of Mahathir\u0027s party near Kuala Lumpur.The time for change has come, and I hope the people in power realise this, said Asifa Hanifah, a young woman who joined thousands of opposition supporters in central Kuala Lumpur who waved flags, cheered and honked car horns.Malaysian police officers fire tear gas towards opposition party supporters in PutrajayaSuva Selvan, a 48-year-old doctor, said he felt the country had just won its independence.I feel that with this change we probably can see something better in the future... our hope for the future is a better government, fair, free and united, he told AFP.Dr Mahathir raised the suspicion of foul play by the election commission for being slow to declare the results as he claimed the victory before official results were announced.“The likelihood is that they (Barison Nasional) would not be forming the government,” he told a press conference. “We believe certain meetings are being held. And we worry what’s the intention of these meetings.”He added: “We hope and pray that the people respect law and order. This is very serious.”Supporters of Mahathir Mohamad, cheer as they watch live televised result announcement oDr Mahathir alleged that the election commission was “holding back the results” and not doing their duty. “The time is very late now. By now we would know who’s wining or losing. But there’s a deliberate attempt to delay by not signing the form,” he said.The election commission denied they were sitting on the results, and said the final tally could take several hours.Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump says Kim Jong-un wants to bring North Korea \u0026#39into the real world\u0026#39 as he greets freed US detainees with flags and fanfare BMW to recall 312,000 cars after finding engines could cut out while being drivenIsrael and Iran lurch closer to all-out war in Syria after alleged rocket attack on Golan HeightsDame Barbara Windsor battling Alzheimer\u0026#39s, her husband revealsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsThe \u0026#39Asian Switzerland\u0026#39: Why Singapore \u0026#39has been chosen to host Trump-Kim summit\u0026#39Slough trading estate is Grade II-listed as shining example of post-modernismDon\u0026#39t forget about other foreigners trapped in North Korea\u0026#39s prison camps, human rights activists warnRBS agrees $4.9bn penalty to end US probe over 2008 financial crisisThree US detainees released by North Korea thank Donald Trump for securing their freedom Barn owl that caused a flap at a wedding is ‘sacked’ by the venueFears of \u0026#39Brexodus\u0026#39 of academics from Britain\u0026#39s universities are \u0026#39a myth\u0026#39, figures showMedics to assess 999 patients over live video footage from smartphonesWorld\u0026#39s deepest plastic bag found at bottom of Mariana Trench - highlighting spread of ocean pollutionYounger GPs \u0026#39really don\u0026#39t like\u0026#39 working long hours, says senior medic as pressure piles on surgeriesBritain\u0026#39s Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, part 3 review: a bathetic conclusion to this righteous campaignHarry and Meghan: A Love Story, review – a perfectly handy primer for the couple of the yearComment: The Iran deal was a monument to Western myopia and groupthink.

But avoid the industrial estate off junction 14 of the M25, because it is now Grade II-listed.The McKay Trading Estate is one of 16 new additions to Historic England’s register of protected buildings, joining the stately Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery as a shining example of post-modernism.Slough first developed an image problem when Sir John Betjeman wrote his poem in 1937. Things went from bad to worse when Ricky Gervais chose Slough Trading Estate as the bleak setting for The Office.However, according to Historic England, McKay’s is a thing of beauty as “the building, forecourt and car parking define the space and represent an urban piazza”. The effect is an “evocation of traditional European squares”, with architectural flourishes that nod to Le Corbusier.Designed by John Outram, the warehouses and office space were completed in 1978 and now house several freight businesses servicing nearby Heathrow.“It was a bit of a shock to find out we might be listed,” said one employee. Do workers feel transported to a European piazza when they arrive each day? “It’s an industrial estate. It certainly doesn’t feel like Venice.”Cowper Terrace in Westbourne Grove, west London, now has listed statusHistoric England has also listed Aztec West, a business park off the M4 near Bristol, which boasts “a Hollywood glamour, accentuated by elements of Art Deco design”.Sixteen post-modern buildings have been added to the register, recognising a style that had its heyday in the 1980s.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: “Post-Modern architecture brought fun and colour to our streets. These are scarce survivals of a really influential period of British architecture and these buildings deserve the protection that listing gives them.”The Sainsbury Wing has been granted Grade I status. It was opened in 1991 and designed by the architects Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown. The design replaced an earlier, more radical vision by Ahrends, Burton and Koralek, which the Prince of Wales famously described as a “monstrous carbuncle” and which was refused planning permission.Charles’s Jencks’s Thematic House, an “inventive and ingenious” home in west London conceived by the architecture critic credited with fostering Post-Modernism, is on the list. The interiors are based around the seasons and the passage of the sun and moon, with a spiral staircase symbolising the sun’s rays.China Wharf in Southwark, on the River Thames, is Grade II-listedThe new additions to the register include a number of housing schemes, four of them in London’s Docklands, and two buildings in Cambridge: Judge Business School and the Katharine Stephen Rare Books Library at Newnham College.Truro Crown Courts in Cornwall has also been listed, with the architects praised for “creating a place which is at the same time humane but reflects its sober purpose”.The listings were approved by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.Britain’s first exhibition devoted to Britain’s post-modern movement opens at Sir John Soane’s Museum in London next week, billed as an exploration of “one of the most inventive periods in British architectural history”.Donald Trump says Kim Jong-un wants to bring North Korea \u0026#39into the real world\u0026#39 as he greets freed US detainees with flags and fanfare BMW to recall 312,000 cars after finding engines could cut out while being drivenIsrael and Iran lurch closer to all-out war in Syria after alleged rocket attack on Golan HeightsDame Barbara Windsor battling Alzheimer\u0026#39s, her husband revealsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsThe \u0026#39Asian Switzerland\u0026#39: Why Singapore \u0026#39has been chosen to host Trump-Kim summit\u0026#39Mahathir Mohamad, 92, on course to be world\u0026#39s oldest elected leader after shock win in Malaysia Don\u0026#39t forget about other foreigners trapped in North Korea\u0026#39s prison camps, human rights activists warnRBS agrees $4.9bn penalty to end US probe over 2008 financial crisisThree US detainees released by North Korea thank Donald Trump for securing their freedom Barn owl that caused a flap at a wedding is ‘sacked’ by the venueFears of \u0026#39Brexodus\u0026#39 of academics from Britain\u0026#39s universities are \u0026#39a myth\u0026#39, figures showMedics to assess 999 patients over live video footage from smartphonesWorld\u0026#39s deepest plastic bag found at bottom of Mariana Trench - highlighting spread of ocean pollutionYounger GPs \u0026#39really don\u0026#39t like\u0026#39 working long hours, says senior medic as pressure piles on surgeriesBritain\u0026#39s Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, part 3 review: a bathetic conclusion to this righteous campaignHarry and Meghan: A Love Story, review – a perfectly handy primer for the couple of the yearComment: The Iran deal was a monument to Western myopia and groupthink.

The time for woolly ideas is over,” Mr Hillman said. In response to the paper from key figures in the higher education sector, Mr Millward said: “I am pleased to see that many of the issues given priority are ones that I am already addressing in my guidance to universities and colleges. “For example, despite the progress made in access and participation for some groups, there are still wide gaps for mature students, for white males from the lowest income groups, and at the universities with the highest admissions requirements. “And when students do enter higher education, certain groups also face real barriers to succeeding during and after their studies, particularly black and Asian students and those with disabilities. “I have made it clear to universities and colleges that I expect them to address these issues in their access and participation plans, which the OfS must approve if they wish to charge higher tuition fees.”Student news in picturesStudent news in

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As these movies have gone on, they’ve also become ever-more interlinked, featuring regular cameos, references, and Easter Eggs to other instalments.For newcomers to superhero movies — perhaps those who have become absorbed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Black Panther — the amount of material to watch can be overwhelming. But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey starting with Iron Man — one of the best MCU instalments to date — moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes all setting up the next movie and has the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the series in chronological order. This might be a little convoluted, but that should not put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out into chronological order including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Agent Carter (seasons one and two)For phase two, things almost play out in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes directly after the first s, meaning the movie has been moved into Phase Two, despite being a Phase Three release. Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two with the introduction of the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield. For those who do embark on Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as they have major effects on the show’s story.All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxys of the Galaxy Vol. 2Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of UltronAgents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also, Black Panther and Spider-Man both take place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok and Panther directly lead into Avengers: Infinity War. Below’s just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 14)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Ant Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, an untitled fourth Avengers movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, s of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Luke Cage season two, Daredevil season three, The Punisher season two, Iron Fist season two, Jessica Jones season three, and New Warriors season one.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Even the government’s own research says the northeast economy will lose growth once we leave the EU regardless of the dealFive Labour MPs from the North East“Because this is so important, we believe the British people should have their say on the final Brexit deal.“Just as the people had their say in the referendum in 2016, we believe the final decision on this country’s destiny should lie with the British people in a people’s vote.”The MPs in particular highlight how firms like Nissan in Sunderland, Hitachi in County Durham and in the chemicals industry on Teesside, providing thousands of jobs, see their future within the EU customs union and single market – which both Conservative and Labour leaderships are committed to quitting.Keir Starmer: Brexit deal means UK will be tied to single market ‘in perpetuity’They also raise concerns over damage to the NHS and concessions that will have to be made to other countries to secure trade deals.They write: “There is so much at stake here. Even the government’s own research says the northeast economy will lose growth once we leave the EU regardless of the deal.“This will hit living standards of families throughout the region. A smaller economy will mean less money to invest in our hard pressed public services.“Already the British economy has fallen from the top to the bottom of the European growth league.”Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It’s utterly astonishing.”When asked if Mr Corbyn would back the amendment, that commits the UK to staying in the European Economic Area, his spokesman said it was “not what we are proposing”.He went on: “We will be pressing the case in the Commons, as the leadership has done in the House of Lords, for a new relationship with the EU, a close relationship with the EU, that is based on a close relationship with the single market ... we will try and unite people around that position, which we think is the right one to promote a Brexit which puts jobs and the economy first.”Business secretary Greg Clark: Thousands of jobs at risk if Theresa May drops Brexit ‘customs partnership’ planMr Corbyn’s spokesman explained that staying in the EEA could undermine a future Labour government’s ability “to intervene” in UK industries with particular issues around state aid and reversing privatisation.Ms May’s cabinet is also deeply ided on Brexit, with the issue of what kind of customs relations to adopt set to be discussed again at a meeting of senior minister on Tuesday.Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has denied being disloyal, despite calling the option of a “customs partnership”, said to be preferred by Ms May, a “crazy” idea.

The European system has a number of technical advantages over the existing generation of GPS and would be operated independently by Europe without reliance on the US.The presentation drawn up by British negotiators outlines how the UK and EU could build a strong security partnership after Brexit, but adds: “The arrangements for any UK cooperation on Galileo are an important test case of the depth of operational cooperation and information sharing envisaged under the security partnership.”British officials said it would be harder for the UK to work closely with the EU on security without full participation in the scheme.The UK negotiators said they want “continued UK participation in the development and operation of the open signal” of the system despite the UK leaving the bloc, as well as access to the private regulated signal for British armed forces.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?They have also demanded that British defence firms must be allowed to bid for contracts on the EU’s secure network on the same “fair” basis as EU firms despite Britain’s departure.The European Commission has already moved to relocate a backup control centre for Galileo from Britain because of Brexit, with operations underway to relocate it to Spain.Brussels has also moved to lock Britain’s defence industry out of bidding for contracts related to the €10bn (£8.8bn) programme – which prompted the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, to warn that the move would be “detrimental to European security”.The UK presentation said Britain will move to develop its own satellite system to compete with Galileo if it doesn’t get full continued participation in the project.David Davis, the Brexit secretary, last year denied the UK was threatening the EU over defence and security to get a better deal, after Theresa May said no deal would be bad for security. “This is not a threat. This is a statement of the fact that this will be harmful for both of us if we don’t get a deal,” he said at the time.The first Galileo satellite was launched in 2005 and the system is expected to be completed by 2020, with early operational capability planned for later this year and full capability by 2019. Its public system will be accurate to one metre and its encrypted version will be accurate to one centimetre.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesIranian MPs burning a US flag in the parliament in Tehran.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Brexit shock as peers vote to keep Britain shackled to EU agencies                Lord Lawson makes BRILLIANT point about why EU wants a BAD Brexit dealAnd according to an online poll of 6,700 Express readers, 94 percent of respondents believe the House of Lords should be abolished.Peers have come under intense criticism from Eurosceptics in recent weeks for what they view as attempting to water down Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plans.The Lords has already dealt 13 defeats to the Government on its EU Withdrawal Bill.Peers voted for a series of amendments to the landmark legislation which include changes which stop Britain achieving a clean Brexit.The amendments need to be agreed by MPs before they become binding.However, Mrs May has a working majority of just 13 seats in the House of Commons, meaning she is left vulnerable by every vote on Brexit.\u0026bullPARLIAMENT153,000 people backed a petition calling for a referendum on axing the House of LordsWhat\u0027s the purpose of the House of Lords?

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling?

They’re following the only possible logic of the Referendum result, the Prime Minister’s own speeches and the Tory manifesto – a document that those remoaning rebels seemed perfectly happy with when they were re-elected off the back of it last year.If a deal between the UK and Brussels stops Britain making independent trade agreements with the rest of the world, or leaves us subject to rules over which we have no say, then it would be a betrayal of the 17.4million people who wanted out of the EU.The Europhile backbenchers know that.

They are just fun.One more wrote: They are meant to be for children, stop taking the fun out of everything. #PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404660739.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa mays customs mess gives jeremy corbyn rare pmqs victory but stand in speaker sir lindsay hoyle the real winner in john bercows absence","story":"Given the Labour boss usually has a complete aversion to talking about all things Brexit, he appears to have caught the Prime Minister off guard with a withering opening belter, asking if she agreed with Boris that the complex tariff collecting plan was “crazy.”The PM never really got into her stride after that, while for once Mr Corbyn’s rigid script actually had some decent and tricky questions on it.And he had a point that “23 months since the referendum” Brits should be able to expect better answers than the garbled waffle Mrs May offered up today.Given the Labour chief has his own headaches to deal with - not least facing a massive rebellion on staying in the Single Market when the EU Withdrawal Bill in two weeks’ time - it seems extraordinary that Mrs May seemed incapable of counter attacking.It was a rare reminder of what Labour could be achieving every week with a leader able to put ruthlessly exploit the bitterly divided Cabinet more than once in a blue moon.And there was something else rather refreshing about today’s weekly Commons bout - not least the fact it did not run on for nearly an hour.The leaders had wrapped up their pithy and succinct exchange in under ten minutes - not just because the PM had nothing to say - but because she was able to mumble her poor answers without a constant interruption from the Speaker.With the embattled John Bercow on official business elsewhere, up stepped his deputy.And if it was an audition for the top job the Labour MP Sir Lindsay Hoyle knocked it out of the park.He spoke for the nation when he told toadies asking long winded planted questions to “get on with it”, and he was able to do it in four words rather than four minutes of smug speeches every week.Gone was the gone was the patronising sneering and hectoring lectures at MPs designed to get the Speaker on the telly.Usually MPs shout “MORE” when their respective leaders have a good day, but today they rightly united in shouting to see “MORE” of Mr Hoyle.FINAL SCORE: Theresa May 1 – 5 Jeremy CorbynOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It had been mentioned in a previous school newsletter but I must admit I hadn’t read it properly.I then wrote a status on my personal Facebook page alerting other parents who may have missed the newsletter about what was happening.Myself and others also agreed that the fact the child would be taken away from their friends and given a different ‘lunch’ in a separate room seemed like a punishment to a child and could easily create upset or bullying opportunities.I also find it appalling that if indeed a parent was struggling to pay lunches for whatever reason, it is the child who would suffer.”The school said they reluctantly introduced the policy after a number of parents persistently failed to pay for their kids’ meals - forcing them to write off the money.They insisted pupils with no packed lunch or dinner money are provided with bread and butter, a selection of fruit and vegetables from the salad bar and a choice of milk or water.They apologised for the lack of clarity around the issue and added: “We take utmost care to listen to and help parents and carers who may be experiencing financial difficulties so that we can ensure their child still receives a meal.“For the children who continue to arrive at school with no meal plan in place, we will endeavour to work with the responsible adults, including those who persistently don’t pay, to find the best solution possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404690378.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle royal wedding prince harry schoolgirl surprise invitation","story":"Leonora Ncomanzi, 13, met the royal couple when they arrived at her school during their first public visit in December last year.The youngster made such an impression on the American actress, 36, that she promised she would return to the Nottingham Academy to see her for a second time.Palace officials then contacted Leonora and the schools deputy principal to say that they have two tickets for the special occasion at Windsor Castle.Leonora received a number of acting tips from her idol during their brief encounter and she has already picked the dress she will wear when the pair tie the knot.She said: When I found out that I was invited to the wedding, I was speechless. I am so excited.When my mum was told I was invited she screamed for five minutes.Meghan is such an inspiration to me, the first time I met her I asked her if she had any advice for me as I want to be an actress like her.“She said I should always be prepared to face rejection but to keep following my dreams. I cant wait to see what she is wearing on the day.I have already bought my own dress too.The invitation follows a number of meetings Leonora has had with Harry, 33, and Meghan as part of the youngsters involvement with the Full Effect programme, which is supported by the royals.In October she joined Prince Harry on his trip to Chicago to attend President Barack Obamas inaugural Foundation Summit.Then in December the schoolgirl and the royal couple discussed her involvement with Full Effect, a mentoring scheme established by Prince Harry aimed at improving the lives of young people.Leonora said the surprise visit at her school in April was a sign of the warmth that Meghan and Prince Harry have shown and that the couple spoke to her like any other person would do.She said: She came back again as she promised she would come again and speak to us.“They speak to us like we’re friends.

Iran is getting the direct assistance from the North Koreans.“The Iran regime shares its own experience and expertise with North Korea”The report alleges that Iran pays the impoverished hermit kingdom in oil in exchange for its nuclear expertise.Despite the 2015 nuclear deal, which President Trump has withdrawn the US from, Iran has continued to develop nuclear-capable missiles, claims Jafarzadeh.He added: “These missiles are not being developed for defensive purposes.“One of the main goals is the missile programme is to develop nuclear-capable missiles that are able to carry nuclear warheads with a range of over 2000km.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404722026.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ants home invasion what to do","story":"Heres all the information you need to know.Ants love your home, especially your kitchen as it is one huge source of food for the pesky insects.An scout ant will leave the nest in search of food, leaving a trail of pheromones.Once it finds food it will follow the trail back, leaving even more pheromones, which then other ants will follow as they go out for food.Soon enough youll have a whole army running all over the place in search of everything from grains of sugar to dirty dishes.Store all food away, ideally in airtight containers, if possible.Dont leave food outClean up any food and drink spills as soon as possible.Clean thoroughly, including cupboards.Wash pet bowls regularly - ants are also partial to cat and dog food too.Take out your rubbish regularly.Clean your entire kitchen with a natural, homemade anti-ant spray, made with one part water, one part vinegar - this destroys their pheromones.Hopefully this will mean the ants move elsewhere in their search for food.Use various ant deterrents such as salt, chalk, curry powder, pepper and cinnamon and line doors and windows with any of these - but these might not be ideal if you have pets and/or small children.If you can follow the ants back to their nest find out how they are getting in and block up any holes with sealant, especially around doors and windows.Perhaps as a last resort, if you know where the nest is, open it up with a knife and then pour a kettle full of boiling water down it.A bit drastic but this will kill all the ants, including the queen. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is not the Battle of Stalingrad.It was a limited confrontation and should be confined to it and not expanded.What we know so farFighter jets have also been seen flying over the annexed area, which lies near the Syria’s southern border, according to reports.Shortly before the suspected strikes on the Golan Heights, which has been occupied by the Israelis since 1967, Syria claimed that Israel had attacked targets in the Quneitra province south of Damascus.Syrias state media said air defences had intercepted hostile Israeli missiles, fired over the south west of the capital city, early on Thursday morning.It later claimed Israeli missiles had destroyed a radar on the northern border.The bombardment comes after missiles strikes on Tuesday were attributed to Israel following reports of “irregular activity” of Iranian forces in Syria.  Campaigners said the strikes killing at least 15 people and targeted depots and rocket launchers that likely belonged to Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.The IDF had deployed Iron Dome defence systems and opened bomb shelters in Golan Heights and in northern Israel in preparation for retaliatory strikes.Tuesdays attacks represent an immediate escalation in tensions in the region after US President Donald Trump walked away from the 2015 nuclear agreement Barack Obama struck with Iran.Known officially as the JCPOA, the so-called Iran deal was designed to curb Iranian nuclear ambitions while in return easing the sanctions crippling its economy.Israel, which almost never confirms or denies airstrikes in Syria, did not comment on Tuesdays attack.Last month, an IDF strike on Syrias T4 air base in Homs province killed seven Iranian military personnel.On April 30, Israel was said to have struck government outposts in northern Syria, killing more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians.Israel did not confirm most of the airstrikes although for months it has repeatedly said it will not accept a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria.In February, the Jewish state, which is a major ally of the US in the troubled region, shot down what it said was an armed Iranian drone that entered Israeli airspace.Israel responded by attacking anti-aircraft positions in Syria, but an Israeli warplane was shot down during the battle.Iranian forces moved into Syria after the outbreak of the civil war in 2011 to back the forces of President Bashar Assad.As that war winds down, and Assad appears to be headed toward victory, Israel fears that Iran, along with tens of thousands of Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen, will carry out attacks against it.Following Americas withdrawal from the Iran deal, Saudi Arabias Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said his country would develop nuclear weapons if Iran restarted its nuclear programme."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004046315661.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"from the argentinian tycoon to the adult film star six secret lovers of prince harrys bride meghan markle revealed","story":"And pals of the royal bride-to-be recall how she took her search for Mr Right very seriously, swearing by a love bible called The Rules.Aimed at women who want “marriage in the shortest time possible”, the self-help guide tells girls to be “easy to be with but hard to get” in order to win The One.Meghan, 36, who will wed Prince Harry on May 19, studied the self-help guide so thoroughly she was able to recite passages off by heart.Today The Sun can reveal for the first time the identities of six men she dated who, according to a source, Meghan measured up as husband material.A source recalled: “Meghan used to quote The Rules all the time and really put it into practise with a number of her boyfriends.“She was never without a boyfriend for more than two or three months and always striving to have someone by her side.“She liked the idea of being part of a team and having a domestic life. Any relationship that she was in, there was always an element of marriage in the back of her mind.“Meghan would very quickly go into thinking, ‘What would this relationship look like in ten years?’”The book’s 35 rules include “No More than Casual Kissing on the First Date”, “Don’t Rush into Sex”, and “Don’t Talk to a Man First (and Don’t Ask Him to Dance).”Written by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider, the guide was an instant sensation when it was first published in 1995.It was also controversial because its rules rejected many feminist ideas. But the source says the techniques Meghan learned from the book were instrumental in her wooing first husband, film producer Trevor Engelson, now 41.The pair began dating in 2004, became engaged in 2010 and married in September 2011. They split two years later.The source said: “She put all The Rules into play with Trevor. He had the bravado, the charisma and the looks.”He also — apparently — had the finger of fate on his side.A source told The Sun that a fortune teller in Argentina once informed a young Meghan that she would wed a man with “curly red hair”.The aspiring actress was given the reading by a clairvoyant in Buenos Aires in 2003 while she working as an intern for the local US embassy.The source said: “She took the prediction quite seriously and when her first husband Trevor Engelson came along, she believed it was a reference to his curly hair.“She thought he must be The One.”Here The Sun reveals six other romances in Meghan’s life before she met her true Prince Charming.WHILE working as an intern at the US embassy in Buenos Aires in 2002, 20-year-old Meghan caught the eye of a passionate and wealthy Argentinian tycoon.One evening, the smitten businessman sent his car to pick up the uni student and take her for a date.A well-placed source told The Sun: “It was something of a liberation for her.“She was off in Argentina, away from everybody and she had this little adventure on the quiet.“He was a successful businessman and it was a case of, ‘I will send a car for you, be ready’.She was really taken by that.”The source said Meghan found the occasion “exciting” but added: “It was very unlike her.”Meghan was in her final year at university at the time, studying international relations and theatre.She took a break to spend “a few months” working at the embassy, where she says she became convinced she would “for sure have a career in politics”.MEGHAN had a single date in 2004 with Scary Movie actor Simon Rex – who long before meeting her had made several porn films.Former model Simon, now 43, even claims to have won an award for Best Gay Solo Video in 1997.He is now also a comedian and rapper, using the rap name Dirt Nasty, and proudly reclines naked on a bearskin rug with his dog Duane in the banner photo on his Twitter home page.Simon also posts crude jokes, recently posing in a Coca-Cola costume with the caption: “I think I have a Coke problem.”Friends say Meghan and Simon had their one-off date in Los Angeles after meeting on the set of short-lived US sitcom Cuts when they both guest-starred in the same episode.He later landed a leading part as George Logan the Scary Movie franchise, and also had a small role in Baywatch. In a 2014 interview he admitted to doing porn as a young man to pay his bills.He said: “I went there and did that s***. It was just enough to pay the rent at the time. I was living in the moment. In hindsight it wasn’t the best move.”There is no suggestion that Meghan ever knew about his porn past.ACTOR and screenwriter Shaun Zaken had a six-month romance with Meghan in 2003.The pair had both attended Chicago’s Northwestern University and both had ambitions to make it in Hollywood, Meghan’s home town.Shaun, now 38, who later played a waiter in an episode of Sex And The City, would practise his audition lines with her.But when he did not want the commitment she craved, they split up.A source said: “His family are well-off with a home in the Hamptons (a posh resort in New York state) and he had good connections in Hollywood. She liked that lifestyle and his access.“But they were both quite demanding and there were passionate public rows.“She really pursued him because she saw a future with him, but he wasn’t ready for that kind of commitment.“She was broken hearted by their split.”Shaun is now a comedy writer and wrote a show last year about a fairytale Prince Charming landing in modern-day Los Angeles.AFTER splitting up from Shaun Zaken in 2003, Meghan dated another actor and writer, Brett Ryland, for five months.Brett – who has appeared in a handful of obscure US television dramas – for five months.One pal said: “Brett adored Meghan. He was constantly trying to shower her with love and she enjoyed the attention, but she seemed to be in it more for the affirmation.“He didn’t have the kind of bravado or high profile she was looking for in a partner. He tried hard but there wasn’t much glamour or huge chemistry.“One day the switch just flipped, like it did with (first husband) Trevor, and she called it off. But he is a good guy, so they stayed friends.”Brett, who lives in Los Angeles, later became a writer for hit show Two Broke Girls before becoming a content media manager for a social media firm.DURING Meghan’s first year at university in Chicago, she fell for strapping college basketball star Steve Lepore.She would gush to pals about her “tall, dark, handsome all-American” boyfriend.A source told The Sun: “She was moving into a new world from LA and being able to land a guy who was already settled and popular was important for her.“She was very proud of having landed this handsome guy and happy to share photos of him. She spoke of how broad and beautiful his chest was.“Meghan was used to being ‘the star’ of the pairing but Steve was the star of the basketball team. She hadn’t ever dated someone like that.”But after five months in 1999, Steve transferred from Northwestern University to a college in North Carolina.Steve, 38, now lives with wife Carrie, 33, and their baby daughter in Virginia, and is a basketball coach at a military academy.After striking out with Steve, Meghan began a stormy nine-month romance with a wealthy fellow student at Northwestern. They had a tumultuous relationship.The source said: “She was very much in love with him, but it was a tempestuous relationship.“It was highs and lows. She was ecstatic when things were good and then she would be in a really dark place.“She was taken by his status as his family were wealthy diplomats, but when she went to Argentina she cut ties and it taught her some lessons about who she should be with.”Top biographer Andrew Morton, Sun Royal photographer Arthur Edwards and Royal Correspondent Emily Andrews will be discussing Meghan and Harry’s wedding -- and sharing their best stories.The chat will be broadcast live on talkRADIO.Free drink and nibbles.To get a ticket go to:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it delivered a withering verdict on the preparation for setting up new trade defence measures by Trade Secretary Liam Fox, finding the resources given to the TRA were wholly inadequate.MPs also said the delay of the Trade Bill until the autumn - revealed by The Sun last week - means the vital trade watchdog would have no legal basis until just weeks before our EU departure at best.Experts told MPs they were sceptical the Government would be able to recruit and train staff to carry out the work needed by next March.But the committee said a fully functioning TRA is critical for a robust regime that protects against unfair moves such as subsidies and dumping.The report said: Trade defence investigations are inherently complex, involving resource-intensive, information gathering exercises and massive calculations.Collecting and analysing the required data necessitates a large staff, with economic, legal, competition, financial analysis and language expertise.Witnesses were sceptical about whether the Government could resource and train staff to perform these investigations in less than 12 months.The committee also raised concerns about the Governments proposals for how the TRA would be appointed.MPs were told that the International Trade Secretary has a significant role in the selection process and that could lead to the body becoming ideologically stacked.They warned it is easy to underestimate how contentious trade defence may be and said the TRA board should be robustly independent.Whoever is chosen to chair the organisation should have to go before the committee for approval, it recommended.Committee chairman Angus MacNeil said: Developing an independent trade policy is an inherently complex exercise, whatever the circumstances.The need to establish new trading relationships must be balanced against the requirement for a robust trade defence regime, capable of protecting domestic industries against unfair trading practices.Establishing a world-class, independent trade remedies authority (TRA) should be high on the Governments trade to-do list. However, the task has been made even more complex by the Department for International Trades familiar foe: time.With March 2019 fast approaching, we have identified serious concerns about whether the TRA can be established, appropriately resourced, and fully operational by the Governments self-imposed deadline.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres everything we know about the condition.Systemic lupus erythematosus, more commonly known as lupus, is a chronic autoimmune disease that occurs when the bodys immune system attacks its own tissues and organs.It is a long term condition that has no known cure and is more commonly found in women than men.At the moment medics are unsure what causes the illness but viral infections, strong medication, sunlight, puberty, childbirth and the menopause can all trigger it.Lupus is often diagnosed by a blood test which will show up a high number of antibodies if the condition is present.The illness causes inflammation of the joints, skin and other organs depending on if it is a mild, moderate or severe.If the condition is mild sufferers will experience joint and skin problems and tiredness.When it is present in a moderate form it causes inflammation of other parts of the skin and body, including lungs, heart and kidneys.Severe lupus can be life threatening as the inflammation it causes can severely damage the heart, lungs, brain or kidneys.Every year on May 10 World Lupus Day is marked across the globe to raise awareness of the condition.There are three common symptoms of the condition, joint pain and stiffness, extreme tiredness that wont go away not matter how much you rest, and skin rashes - generally over the nose and cheeks in a butterfly shape.Other symptoms of lupus are weight loss, swollen glands, sensitivity to light which can cause rashes on exposed skin, and poor circulation in your fingers and toes.However, symptoms of the illness can flare up and disappear and in some cases suffers may experience severe symptoms for a few weeks or longer before they settle down again.There is no cure for lupus but early treatment of the symptoms can reduce the risk of it getting worse and help control the symptoms.In the UK it is generally treated with anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and hydroxychloroquine for fatigue and skin and joint problems.To manage kidney inflammation and rashes steroid tablets, injections and creams are issued to sufferers.There are two new medicines that can be used to treat severe lupus, rituximab and belimumab, which work on the immune system to reduce the number of antibodies in the blood.As the condition can cause kidney failure, a complication called lupus nephritis, some sufferers may end up needing to undergo dialysis or a kidney transplant.The NHS also advise Lupus sufferers to make life style changes including eating healthily, using high factor sun cream, wearing a hat in the sun, and stopping smoking.Selena told NBC news: I would get fevers, headaches, I would get fatigue but I always just keep going and kind of ignored it to be honest because it wasnt something I maybe I really wanted to accept.I dont think I made the right decisions because I didnt accept it and thats really selfish and at the same time really, really just unnecessary.Im not really proud of that.In a speech at a Lupus Alliance event in 2017 she said: I was diagnosed with lupus about five or six years ago and Ive been speaking out about my disease to raise awareness and so that people see a doctor right away if they feel they have any symptoms and just so that honestly people can understand what it means to live with lupus.I also want people to know why research is so important and why we must support the scientists who bring new discoveries.After undergoing so many tests to monitor my kidneys my doctors told me I had lupus nephritis, one of the most common complications of lupus.They said that I would be needing a kidney transplant. Maybe I wasnt necessarily really good at knowing what that meant.It actually got to a point where it was life or death. Thankfully one of my best friends gave me her kidney and it was the ultimate gift of life and im doing very well know thankfully."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-u2-adele-mick-jagger_4304981.jpg?20180509184328 ","title":"adele sir mick u2 who tops musician rich list","story":"The table - revealed ahead of the publication of the newspaper\u0027s full 1,000-person ranking on Sunday - features icons from across more than five decades of British pop and rock, including members of The Rolling Stones and Queen.Former Beatles star Sir Paul McCartney tops the list, with he and wife Nancy Shevell sharing a fortune of \u0026#163820m.Sir Paul is now the richest musician in the history of the Sunday Times\u0027 rich list thanks to the never-ending royalty stream from The Beatles back catalogue, plus a 37-date international tour grossing \u0026#163100m at the box office.:: Sir Paul: The future of music is in danger Even second-placed Lord Lloyd-Webber is comfortably behind at \u0026#163740m, with U2 in third with \u0026#163569m.Sheeran is not the only younger face to make the top 40, though, with Adele sharing 18th position with Calvin Harris and Charlie Watts thanks to 12 months which saw her personal wealth bumped up by \u0026#16315m, taking her to a cool \u0026#163140m.Her album 25 is believed to have sold more than 20m copies globally and was one of the UK\u0027s top-selling records in 2017, even though it was released in 2015.She and Sheeran are unsurprisingly well out in front on the Sunday Times\u0027 rich list dedicated to young musicians.:: 1D: Is the former pop group heading in the same direction?

Managing Director Colin Paynter said work on Galileo, currently run out of Portsmouth, will move to France and Germany “on day one” if the firm wins a new \u0026pound175m contract. He said Brussels made a condition that the work, on ground control operations, “has to be led by an EU-based company by March 2019.” He told MPs on the Brexit Committee: “We have committed to, should we win that bid, we will do all the work in the EU27 at our sites in France in Germany.  Britain could launch its own satellite GPS system if the EU bans it from the Galileo programme after Brexit  “That has made us slightly less competitive because we’re moving away from where the heritage and skill is, which is in the UK.” “And I think a number of companies are in the process of moving that work so they comply with conditions of the tenders.” Airbus put in its bid last month.  It is the latest twist in a Brexit row over Brussels’ \u0026pound9bn satellite navigation network. Brussels has reportedly threatened to cut UK ties with Galileo, an EU rival to the US-controlled GPS network, on security grounds. In turn UK sources are threatening to block Galileo from using UK overseas territories, block UK firms from passing sensitive information to the EU - or even set up a \u0026pound3bn rival UK system.  A top military chief branded the EU’s threats “odd”. Air Marshal Edward Stringer, RAF Director General Joint Force Development, told the Policy Exchange think tank: “European defence is a nicety - the defence of Europe is a necessity. “When you consider how much we share with our European allies it does seem odd that security questions are raised over something like Galileo. I’m sure those are not insurmountable.”  Top Lockheed Martin executive Patrick Wood added the row was “a small glitch along the way”.

And he made a very good fist of it.  Given Labour’s own difficulties on the issue as illustrated by last night’s rebellion in the Lords you could understand why Corbyn might have wished to avoid the subject.  Clearly the Cabinet’s disarray was too tempting to ignore for the Labour leader. Corbyn’s questions were uncharacteristically sharp and direct. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Foreign Secretary that her plans for a customs partnership were crazy? was his opening gambit.  Theresa May immediately relapsed into her dismal speak-your-weight machine mode. We are, she said, leaving the European Union and leaving the customs union. As with all her subsequent answers these words were delivered with a weight and importance that belied the triteness and inadequacy of their content. Perhaps she surmised that if she feigned the role of Prime Minister nobody would realise she was a malfunctioning hologram bereft of any answers. Corbyn briefly acknowledged her non response before moving on to the the wider Cabinet confusion. He noted the differing views between the Business Secretary and the Foreign Secretary on the proposed customs arrangements. He pointed out that neither of the Cabinet’s preferred options were workable. And he noted that after 23 months the Government had failed to come up with a solution. When, he asked, would the Government bring forward the trade bill and the customs bill?  The Prime Minister did not such much duck the question as run to the other side of the country, hide under a blanket and put her fingers in her ears before muttering “can’t hear you, can’t hear you.” We are working for the best deal, was the best response she could muster. Which you suppose is reassuring when the alternative would be a government knowingly working for the worst deal. Mrs May ended with a feeble attack on Labour’s performance in the local elections. Six times she was asked a direct question by the Labour leader and six times she failed to give a straight answer. Who knew that Brexit could prove such fertile ground for a Labour leader generally regarded as ambivalent on the subject?

Kaylene Vymola, 21, wanted to get in shape in time for a dream holiday to Mexico, so she\u0027d feel confident in a bikini on the beach. Though the instructional technology rep cut out unhealthy food she says she didn\u0027t hit the gym once - and instead opted to start walking everywhere. Kaylene would trek on her lunch breaks and go for hour-long strolls around her neighborhood each night. By the time she and boyfriend Alex Lo Monaco flew to Playa Del Carmen six months later she had dropped an impressive 40lbs, losing another 20lbs when she returned. Kalyene says she felt good in her bikini and to top it all off, romantic Alex, a customer service rep, got down on one knee while they were away and asked her to marry him.  Now the beautiful bride-to-be said she feels happier and more confident and has revealed her simple secret to success. Kaylene, of Niantic, Connecticut, said: It was just walking. I never stepped foot in a gym, I just walked and walked and walked and walked.I would walk about 15,000 steps a day - six miles. I would always walk during my lunch breaks. It was either sitting at my desk or sitting in a cafe, or going outside and going for walk. Every day after work I would go for an hour long walk through my neighborhood.Honestly I didn\u0027t feel that I needed to go to the gym. I didn\u0027t want to spend the money on it. I had a lot of people come up to me and ask me, \u0027How did you do it?\u0027 I had a lot of family members who said, \u0027You look great. \u0027I feel a lot better now. I feel much more confident, not only in my looks but in my personality. I feel like I can talk to more people. I definitely have more energy as well. I could go all night walking around my neighborhood now.  Kaylene decided to make a change in July 2017 in time for her vacation that December, firstly by cutting out some of the junk she was eating. She stuck to her favorite breakfast of eggs but switched chips and sandwiches from Subway for grilled chicken and salads at lunch. For dinner, she ditched carb-heavy pizza and pasta in favor of protein-based meals and she completely cut out her guilty pleasure - chocolate. Instead of munching on Kit Kats and Reese\u0027s she opted for healthy snacks and she swapped coffee for tea, always ensuring she was in a calorie deficit for the day. Kaylene also took up her walking regime and by the she stepped on the plane to Mexico she had lost 40lbs. She went on to lose a further 20lbs after returning home.  I have always kind of been on the overweight side and I was self conscious, she said. Through my teens, being in school and comparing yourself to other skinny little girls who get all the attention from the guys - it was very frustrating. I wasn\u0027t extremely down about it but it always kind of bothered me. I felt unhappy. In summer you want to wear bikinis and dresses and I was very hesitant because I didn\u0027t feel great in them. We have four beaches in the town I live in and my friends would always go, but I would avoid it. I wasn\u0027t worried about comments, it was more that I didn\u0027t want to be around a bunch of really good looking people and I felt I didn\u0027t look good. My goal was to feel confident in a bikini. I just wanted to feel better and more confident and not worry about people staring. It was torture in the beginning but Mexico was keeping me going because I had it booked.

After battling autoimmune issues, Taylor Muhl was diagnosed with ‘chimerism’ - a condition in which a fraternal twin dies in utero and is fused into the surviving twin.  The condition is named after the chimera, a fire-breathing female monster in Greek mythology with a lion\u0027s head, a goat\u0027s body, and a serpent\u0027s tail. As a result of her chimerism, Taylor has two sets of DNA, two sets of blood cells and two immune systems. Taylor\u0027s physical abnormality appears as a straight line that runs down the centre of her torso dividing it into two different colours - the left side of the pigmentation being her twin’s genetic makeup and the right side being her own.  After years of constant doctor visits and numerous tests, Taylor was finally diagnosed in her twenties and has decided to allow the world to see her skin in hopes of raising awareness about chimerism and to encourage other chimeras to embrace their condition publicly. Taylor, from Los Angeles, told Barcroft TV: I am my own twin because I have two genetic makeups within one body. It’s basically having totally two different humans under the same hood of the car, so to speak.  When I grew up no-one said anything about my second colour skin pigmentation because no-one really knew. The only people that did know were probably my closest friends and family. Anywhere I went publicly I always kept it covered. My whole life I was always told that my second colour skin pigmentation was just a birthmark. Most doctors, even in this day and age, don’t know about chimerism because it’s that rare.  Determined to have a natural pregnancy and home birth, Taylor’s mum Alex Muhl opted against having an ultrasound and so was completely unaware that she was due to have twins. She said: I had Taylor at home and I had two midwifes who took care of me. Everything was done naturally and part of it was to not upset the child. I just firmly believed it was something I did not want to do to the baby. I wanted it to be natural. So I never knew.  As soon as Taylor was born, we just swaddled her and enjoyed the moment. Then after the midwife swept her away to bathe her and weigh her and then brought her back, it was like, ‘Wow! What is this?’ And there was this demarcation down the middle of her abdomen.” Prior to being diagnosed, as a young child Taylor had a strange obsession with being a twin, constantly wanted to dress like her best friend and would even ofter ask her mother if she actually had a sibling of her own.  While working in the entertainment industry, she struggled to comfortably show off her torso, eventually leading her to try and laser off her ‘birthmark\u0027. Taylor said: I think my very first appointment was so painful to the point that it brought me to tears. I was just blown away because I couldn’t understand why it was hurting so bad if it was just a birthmark.  The doctor wanted me to come back for a second time and I just said, ‘No way, it’s staying on me.’ It was unbearable, so it cannot be removed. It’s been on me since the day I was born and it will be there till I leave. After hiding her stomach for most of her life, Taylor decided to come out publicly last year to finally freely showcase her pigmentation to the entire world - and says it has even helped her modelling career. Taylor said: I definitely had times in my life I had been insecure about showing my torso. I was so scared that if I showed my torso on a job or a photo shoot, that clients would never want to work with me again. Or I might not book the job to begin with because I am \u0027different’.

Alexander Veach, 30, from Los Angeles, California, decided to return to his birth-assigned gender, having lived as a woman and also tried to be both a male and female. Dubbed the ‘bigender doll’, he spent a whopping $10,000 (7.3kGBP) on his transformation, carefully balancing oestrogen and testosterone along with laser hair removal all over his body. But last year, while acting as a transgender female-to-male character in a play at the Underground Theater in Hollywood, he realised he could no longer keep living as a woman named Aria and started to revert.  Now he’s happier than ever but battles the difficulties of having enlarged round breasts and is currently trying to rid himself of gynecomastia through working-out. Alexander, a bioengineer, said: “I’m stable living as Alexander now, I was Aria for three years. Aria and Alex have two hugely different lives. “I’m not someone living in a box, I don’t let gender norms tell me what to do or stop me from having a place in society. “People think I’m fake and not genuine but I really believed head-to-toe that I was a woman in a man’s body. “Since reverting back, people have commented on my bigger breasts but I’ve been doing an insane number of in order to hide my breasts I started a physical training workout of push-ups and cardio to try to transform my body again.  “I’m working on my pecks, I’m not interested in surgery but will try to do it the hard way and build my body, that’s my personal strategy. “It bothers me a little, though I\u0027ve grown to be comfortable with my body but I’m not sure if I would on a beach, I have very round breasts. “When I find the right woman she won’t care, I still have feminine traits like full body laser, but testosterone means my hair is all coming back. “It’s crazy that it’s not permanent and is reversible, which shows how robust the human body is. “I’m focussed on reversing it and getting stronger, I’m patient though, it took me three years to transition to a woman so to expect all these changes in four months is expecting a lot.”  Alexander realised he wanted to transition to become a woman in 2014 after experimenting with sexual roleplay. But eventually he became hooked, choosing to go to work as a man and living as a woman by night after applying nail polish and donning female clothing. He started living androgynously, under the name Alex, before living full-time as a woman called Aria after recognising he was dressing as a woman every night. Until last year, when the bioengineer started to combine male and female hormone replacement therapy so that he could live as both genders.  Since choosing to live as Alexander again, he has taken two testosterone shots in the last year but has been warned by his endocrinologist he cannot take any more. Alexander said: “There was a time in my life when I was exercising my femininity but now I have stepped back from that I know I have a Y chromosome that’s not going anywhere. “I wanted life to be simple again, I wanted to have more stability and stop comparing myself to all these icons in the media and live genuinely. “In one year you can manifest completely different physical and mental changes, I believe that hormone replacement therapy changed my mind too. “My endocrinologist won’t let me take testosterone, my levels are very high and so it would be dangerous. “It’s like I’m going through another puberty and can see a beautiful person beginning to emerge. “I’m not uncomfortable I’m amazed at the image I wake up to and I know that it’s my art as well as a sign of being human.”  Since deciding to return to living as a man he says some people have spoken out about his changes and even accused him of being ‘fake’. Other have told him they ‘miss Aria’ as that is the only side to him they ever knew. Despite this, he is proud of his decision, maintaining that he is done with womanhood and relieved that his family have been very supportive. Alexander commented on female life, he said: “There are many higher expenses women have to endure, I just quit womanhood, it’s expensive, competitive and I don’t have any more time for it. “People can be cruel, everyone needs to be brave enough to embrace the full range of life’s possibilities. “If we can support one another who knows what could be possible.”  Alexander says that music has been a massive comfort during his journey, allowing him a way to outflow his feelings and what he has learned. He claims his soon to be released Hip-Hop album will feature Wiz Khalifa and will also have Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross and Gucci Mane on the same song too. Alexander said: “Being transgender is a lot of stress, the way I handled the emotional stress was through my music. “It’s a lonely and isolated life, but music helped me to convey some of my frustrations, writing the lyrics helped me to be clear with what I wanted with life.” Alex is part of The Plastics of Hollywood, the first real life barbie and human doll house – documenting their lives from the next surgeries to their dreams and aspirations. He is joined by manager Marcela Iglesias and other notable stars from Rodrigo Alves and Justin Jedlica to Pixie Fox, Vinny Ohh, Jennifer Pamplona and many more.

The happy couple – whose wedding is on May 19 in Windsor – are said to be very excited about starting a family. A pal said: “They’re desperate to have children as soon as possible, they’re hoping it won’t take long.” It means young royals Louis, Charlotte and George may not have long to wait for a cousin following their Uncle Harry’s wedding. Pals of the 33-year-old prince and US actress, 36, agree a baby will be their top priority. Harry has said in 2015: “I’d love to have kids right now.” And he said in his engagement interview: “Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.”  And Meghan has confided in ex-agent Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne: “I’d absolutely love to have children, and I can’t wait to be a mother.” Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine, said: “You would imagine a baby must be quite high on the agenda given Meghan’s age. We all know that Harry loves children. He’s a great uncle and the expectation is that he will be an equally great father.” Harry is expected to beat the time brother Wills took to start a family.  After Wills and Kate Middleton wed in April 2011, the couple announced in December 2012 that a baby was on the way. George was born on July 22, 2013, followed by Charlotte in May 2015, and Louis on April 23 this year.

Leonora Ncomanzi was left speechless when she was told by the she would be attending the wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor Castle, on May, 19. The 13-year-old, who attends Nottingham Academy, has already picked her dress for the big day after being told a month ago about the invite. She first met her idol Meghan during a visit to the academy in December, last year, after the couple\u0027s first public visit following their engagement and the pair hit it off.  Meghan honoured her promise to the youngster and returned to the school for a private visit earlier this year and spent some time with Leonora giving her acting tips. Palace officials then contacted Leonora and the school\u0027s deputy principal that they have two tickets and will be attending the wedding. Leonora said: When I found out that I was invited to the wedding, I was speechless. I am so excited! When my mum was told I was invited she screamed for five minutes. Meghan is such an inspiration to me, the first time I met her I asked her if she had any advice for me as I want to be an actress like her. “She said I should always be prepared to face rejection but to keep following my dreams. I can\u0027t wait to see what she is wearing on the day. I have already bought my own dress too.  The invitation follows a number of meetings Leonora has had with Harry and latterly Meghan as part of her involvement with the nurture group run by the Full Effect programme supported by the royals. In October she joined Prince Harry on his trip to Chicago to attend President Barack Obama\u0027s inaugural Foundation Summit. Then in December the schoolgirl and the royal couple discussed her involvement with Full Effect, a mentoring scheme established by Prince Harry aimed at improving the lives of young people. Leonora said the surprise visit was a sign of the warmth that Meghan and Prince Harry have shown and that the couple spoke to her like any other person would do. She said: She came back again as she promised she would come again and speak to us. “They speak to us like we’re friends. I was so happy. “I’m looking forward to the wedding a lot, a lot. “Because I can’t wait to see Meghan again and hopefully she\u0027ll come again to us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"help me im burning horrific","story":"News\"Help me, I\u0027m burning\": Horrific moment teen writhes in agony and doses herself with water after suspected acid attack in BrixtonWARNING DISTRESSING FOOTAGE: The 18-year-old was seen collapsing onto the floor in a stall in Brixton, south London, after pouring bottles of water into her mouth as she desperately tries to wash away the substance\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachel Bishop21:00, 9 MAY 2018Updated07:33, 10 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDistressing CCTV shows the moment a teenage girl writhed in pain on the ground after a suspected acid attack on a London bus.

Mr Raffiq is seen on the CCTV video trying to help her as another bystander calls an ambulance. He previously said: This lady came out of the bus, she was screaming, she came to the shop asking for water and was pouring it on her face. She went in to my shop and she was lying on the floor saying someone had sprayed something in her mouth.  A few of us tried to call her but she was just screaming in pain. We poured 10 bottles of water over her face.   Eyewitnesses said the woman jumped off the bus and ran into a shopping centre begging for water.    Police have confirmed the woman was taken to hospital for treatment and her condition is not life-changing or life-threatening. She has not been left with any major burns. People on social media described feeling sick after they saw a young woman being doused with water by firefighters. One passer-by said she saw a woman sat on the floor while being treated with water. Police were called to the scene at around 1.45pm by the London Ambulance Service.  Lambeth Police said: The woman injured on the bus as a result of the suspected noxious substance has been taken to hospital. Her condition is not life changing or life threatening. No major burns. Enquiries continue to trace the single male suspect. This attack appears to be a targeted \u0026amp not random. Images from the scene show a number of emergency service vehicles parked at the junction of Electric Avenue and Brixton Road. Another witnesses, Claire Martin, took an image from inside a bus of police cars parked along the street with police tape outside H\u0026ampM. Passer-by Becky Reid said: Feel physically sick after walking past a poor innocent person getting hosed down by firefighters are being could in the middle of an acid fight in Brixton. So scary this can happen on our doorstep. Hope they are ok?    The suspected attack comes after a bank holiday weekend crimewave. On Sunday morning, three people were hurt when they were doused with a noxious substance during a fight between two groups in Shacklewell Lane in Hackney, east London, at around 5.20am Police previously issued an appeal to help trace a single male believed to have been involved in the incident - but they have since said they are looking for a woman instead. The Met Police said in a statement: Officers continue to investigate after a woman was targeted in a suspected noxious substance attack in Lambeth. Police were called to Brixton Road, SW9 by The London Ambulance Service (LAS) at 13.45hrs on Tuesday, May 8, following reports of a woman being the victim of a suspected noxious substance attack whilst on a bus.

(Image: Getty Images Europe)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey\u0027re both women who\u0027ve been plucked from relative obscurity and launched into the harsh glare of the public eye - and all thanks to who their daughters fell in love with.  At a first glance, Carole Middleton and Doria Ragland appear to be polar opposites.  One is a yoga-loving, free-spirited social worker. The other is an uber-coiffed home counties matriarch and self-made millionaire.  Come May 19 , however, Doria joins the strange club that Carole has inhabited for the last seven years - an in-law to the royals.   This weird world they\u0027ll be thrown into - with it\u0027s unforgiving spotlight - might not be the only thing they have in common though.  1. Closeness to their daughters  The first time we ever heard the then-Kate Middleton speak was during her engagement interview, when she painted an image of a close-knit family and a happy upbringing. Fast-forward nearly eight years, and it\u0027s clear the Middletons are as tight as ever. In those early weeks after Prince George\u0027s birth, Kate and William relocated to Carole and Michael\u0027s house in Berkshire. Set on 18 acres of land, it provided a haven for the new family.  Carole is believed to be a hands-on granny with her grandchildren too. It\u0027s believed she\u0027s stepped in to give her daughter a helping hand now she\u0027s a mum-of-three , and is frequently seen at royal events - at the invitation of the Queen no less.  Despite geography keeping them apart, Doria and Meghan are no less close.           After divorcing Meghan\u0027s dad, Thomas Markle, when Meghan was six, Doria had Meghan live with her (although the Suits actor did see her dad regularly). On her now-defunct blog, The Tig, Meghan rather sweetly revealed her mum\u0027s pet name for her was Flower and has written about her several times.  In a post called Love Letter, she wrote: Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free spirit. Lover of potato chips \u0026amp lemon tarts. And if the DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic \u0027Call Me,\u0027 just forget it. She will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance you\u0027ve ever seen, swaying her head and snapping her fingers to the beat like she’s been dancing since the womb. And you will smile. You won\u0027t be able to help it. You will look at her and you will feel joy. I\u0027m talking about my mom. It appears Harry is a fan of Doria\u0027s too, in the BBC interview following their engagement he enthused: Her mum’s amazing!  2. Work Much is made of Carole and Michael Middleton\u0027s success, but before Party Pieces elevated them into the category of the super-wealthy, Carole worked as a flight attendant.  As, apparently, did Doria in the years after her divorce from Meghan\u0027s dad, the Mail Online reports.  Since the Middleton\u0027s launched Party Pieces in 1987, the company is now believed to be valued at \u0026pound30 million.  Doria\u0027s long career is as social worker is no less impressive. The yoga fanatic is nicely tucked away from all the crazy circus of the royal wedding, and still works Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in Culver City, California. 3. Marriage Carole and Michale Middleton married in 1980 and have presented a pretty solid front ever since. They\u0027re never not smiley and seen to be loving life. Doria and lighting-director Thomas married in 1979 in a wedding that is a far cry from the pomp and ceremony their own daughter will experience.   The bride wore flowers in her hair and the whole day had a New Age feel about, taking place at the Self-Realisation Fellowship Temple on Sunset Boulevard.   Sadly they divorced eight years later, but it\u0027s believed the split was amicable, and they will be presenting a united front at their daughter\u0027s wedding.  They both issued a joint statement following the news of Meghan and Harry\u0027s engagement, which read: We are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry.  Our daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents. We wish them a lifetime of happiness and are very excited for their future together. 4. Style and health Of the two women, Carole is the undisputed queen of splashing the cash on looking good. She\u0027s been known to frequent Richard Ward’s salon in Chelsea, where a Cleanse, Condition, Cut and Finish can set you back \u0026pound225.  According to the Mail, Carole is also partial to facial courtesy of celebrity facialist Linda Meredith, whose anti-ageing treatments cost around \u0026pound150.  That said, Doria\u0027s no slob when it comes to skincare.  When I was 13 years old, my mum had me start getting facials, Meghan has said. It seemed so silly at the time, trekking in my school uniform to see a woman named Anika who slathered my skin with Yon-Ka products and chatted away about the importance of eye cream.

As a nation we just all really love Prince Harry . We’ve been rooting for him, hard, since we saw that image that haunts us – which I don’t even need to expand on, because everyone immediately knows what I mean – back in 1997.  That’s over 20 years of rooting. So we’re pretty much definitely, unreservedly, on board with anyone who makes him as happy as he currently is.  Obviously it doesn’t hurt that Ms Markle’s ’mazing in her own right, too though. It’s the buttercream icing on top of the lemon and elderflower wedding cake she’s chosen, which is just the kind of perfect detail that makes us like her even more.  The funny thing is that Harry’s so delighted with her, we’d have loved and accepted Meghan wholeheartedly whatever she was like. It’s almost a waste for her to be as good as she is.  Let’s put aside the obvious (ethnicity, marital status, etc) because it’s a breath of stale air to describe her as a breath of fresh air, and yet impossible not to. There’s something extra about Meghan that seems different. Maybe it’s because she’s from another country, so hasn’t grown up being fully familiar with how stiff and formal the royals are... or maybe she knows all too well, and has decided it’s time for a change. The Royal Family are famously standoffish, but Meghan’s a hugger. When we see her with the public, sometimes it can seem a bit much, but that’s just because of how conditioned we are, what we’ve become used to over the years. Everywhere she goes at the moment, she’s meeting people who are genuinely thrilled for her, swept up in her love story and fervently wishing her the best – it’s actually extremely appropriate to be charmed by that. Meghan’s not being over the top, she’s behaving like a normal human being with feelings rather than a stuffy robot.

Seb Morris was \u0027very upset\u0027 at the death of his canine \u0027\u0027best mate,\u0027\u0027 who had to be put down, his mum said in a written statement. The young boy had also taken an overdose on two previous occasions in the year before he died, the inquest heard. The keen boxer, described by his parents as “caring and helpful,” was found by his mother on November 18, 2017. An inquest heard that just a week prior to the teen\u0027s death, the family dog, Tilly, had been put down.  Claire\u0027s statement to the inquest said: “It was very upsetting for Seb. We got Tilly when he was four years old, so he\u0027d never known life without her. “She was his best friend, he spent a lot of time with her. “We buried her in the back garden, and on the day we buried her he slept for an hour in a chair beside her, with his headphones on listening to music. “He also slept with her blanket for the first couple of nights – but then stopped that. He said it was too soon, and we didn\u0027t give her enough of a chance to get better.”  Less than a year before Seb\u0027s death, the Year 10 Heathfield Community School student had, on two separate occasions, taken an overdose. But Claire said Seb was a popular, well-liked boy who enjoyed going out with friends, and in the months leading up to his death she had no concerns about his mental health.  Coroner Tony Williams, at Taunton Coroners Court, recorded Seb\u0027s cause of death as hanging – but added that Seb\u0027s intentions at that time were not clear, reports Somerset Live .  A statement from Claire read at the inquest in Taunton heard that she had left Seb alone at their home in Creech St Michael for a couple of hours in the morning. The statement said: “At around 10am on Saturday, November 18, I took my two younger daughters to a party. “Just before leaving the house I popped my head around the door of Seb\u0027s room to see if he was okay.  He was still in bed in his pyjamas, playing on the iPad. He seemed okay, there was nothing out of the ordinary.” Claire said she returned home at around 12.30pm and called up to her son, but received no reply, and assumed he had gone out with friends. She said: “I pottered around the kitchen making lunch, and then I noticed that his shoes were by the back door. “I went up the stairs to see if he wanted some lunch. The door was ajar so I pushed it open and ran into his bedroom. “I was screaming, so my daughter ran to get our neighbour. I was also on the phone to my partner, Paul, the whole time, and he rang the ambulance.” Claire said that on Friday, November 17, the night before Seb\u0027s death, he had gone out with friends, and seemed in good spirits when he returned.

Now experts have worked out Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s big day could come with a hefty price tag - a cool \u0026pound32million. The average person spends \u0026pound17,913 on their day, but the royal couple\u0027s comes with a lot of extras - from bespoke silver plated fanfare trumpets to a drone destroyer. Wedding planning company Bridebook has calculated the cost based on flowers, food, entertainment and the main attraction, the dress coming in at \u0026pound1,969,873, but there\u0027s also the \u0026pound120,000 honeymoon and \u0026pound30m security costs. It\u0027s unsurprising then that the wedding, which is being held at Windsor Castle on May 19 , is expected to make the list of one of the top ten expensive weddings of all time. The main cost is down to security, as Windsor will be locked down for the day, bumping up that security bill, including snipers, undercover police and a counter-drone system - it\u0027s estimated to all cost \u0026pound30million. The bill is expected to come in higher than brother Prince William\u0027s wedding, which cost \u0026pound20m - though it was a larger affair - because of the ongoing terrorist threat level. Venue - Free  The ceremony is taking place at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle while the reception will be in St George\u0027s Great Hall, within the castle.  Marquee - \u0026pound350,000 Later the party moves to the Upper Ward grounds of Windsor. While the pair don\u0027t have to pay for the venue, they will have to fork out for that marquee.  A luxury glass marquee, similar to Pippa\u0027s cost \u0026pound300,00- plus additional catering and staff.  Catering - \u0026pound286,000 There\u0027s the formal lunch reception for state guests and the dinner reception for their family and friends. This will end up being one of the more costly parts of the wedding. Sausage rolls and hot tea for the members of the public won\u0027t come cheap either, with 2,640 of them it could come in at \u0026pound26,000! Cake - \u0026pound50,000  Harry and Meghan are opting for a banana wedding cake (we know) as well as a second cake. The unique cake will be made by pastry chef Claire Ptak , - owner of London hipster hotspot Violet Bakery. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers. Drinks - \u0026pound193,000 It\u0027s not a party, without a tipple or two! The drinks will most likely come from the Palace Cellars, but they\u0027re still worth a fair bit. If we\u0027re looking at the number of guests, they\u0027ll probably need 2,300 bottles to keep guests happy. Bridebook works out roughly 1,700 bottles of champers will be served throughout the day and 650 bottles of wine, whiskey and cocktails. A bottle of Bollinger, the family\u0027s favourite champagne, comes in at \u0026pound80 a bottle - that\u0027s \u0026pound136,000 overall. Prince Charles enjoys the 15-year-old Laphroaig Scotch and the multitude of bottles of Tignanello Wine (Meghan’s personal favourite according to her old lifestyle blog, “The Tig”) so the bill really adds up. Prince Harry\u0027s fav drink comes in a little cheaper - it\u0027s a Vodka Redbull. Dress - \u0026pound300,000 Meghan is expected to rack up quite the bill with her wedding dress , which is fair enough considering all eyes will be on her. Most of the budget will go on her first dress, which will be made just for her. There\u0027s a lot of rumours as to who will design it and what it will look like, but you can expect a clean, classic look with a modern twist. A dress like this, plus her second outfit for afterwards will come in at \u0026pound300,000 plus. She\u0027s teaming it up with a tiara .  Other sources have predicted that Meghan\u0027s dress will cost far less. Royal expert Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss and Love, told The : “Meghan is very mindful of wanting to send the right message with her gown. “It’s going to be iconic and fit the backdrop of Windsor Castle, but it would send off the wrong message to wear a dress that in cost alone would upstage Kate’s.” Kate\u0027s dress, Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, came in at \u0026pound250,000. Flowers - \u0026pound110,000  This often costs more than you expect, and with two locations it\u0027ll cost even more. Flowers for the marquee alone cost cost approximately \u0026pound70,000. The flowers in St George\u0027s Chapel and at the formal reception which follows will be provided by self-taught florist Philippa Craddock. Photos - \u0026pound17,000 Cheap hey? Dorset-based Millie Pilkington, the private wedding photographer for the William and Kate’s wedding and Pippa Middleton’s, is expected to take the pics, though Hugo Burnand should also be around for the official snaps. Stationary - \u0026pound20,000  Kensington Palace has announced Barnard and Westwood made the beautiful bespoke invitations for the Royal Wedding. A 200 piece Bespoke Stationery set from Barnard and Westwood exceeds the \u0026pound10,000 mark. The invites, with the Three-Feathered Badge of the Prince of Wales printed in gold ink, could cost a total of \u0026pound200,000 for the circa 4000 invitees, including members of the public, or \u0026pound50,000 for the VIP guests alone. Music - \u0026pound300,000  That\u0027s the bell ringers, organist, choirs....then the music for the reception too. Rumours are flying around as to who will perform - from the Spice Girls to Elton John in the running, Coldplay\u0027s Chris Martin or Meghan\u0027s mate Rihanna...but there\u0027s still the church music to pay for. Trumpets - \u0026pound90,000 Yes, trumpets. The Ministry of Defence has made a request for 20 silver-plated fanfare trumpets stamped with the Royal Coat of Arms. Made in the same workshop where Will \u0026amp Kate’s wedding and the London Olympics’ trumpets came from, each bespoke trumpet costs between \u0026pound3,000 and \u0026pound6,000. Decorations - \u0026pound130,000 The lighting for the church, marquee and furniture all rack up the cost.  Wedding rings - \u0026pound6,000 Since 1923, it has been a tradition in the Royal Family to use Welsh gold for the wedding ring of the bride. Royal warrant holder Wartski, with ties to Wales, created Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge’s ring, so could be the same choice of Meghan’s.  Prince Phillip and Prince William chose not to wear a ring, but it\u0027s thought Harry will opt to follow in his father\u0027s footsteps and wear a band. Charles\u0027 is on a ring on his little finger on his left hand, but Harry may opt for the traditional fourth finger.  While Meghan isn\u0027t opting for adult bridesmaids she is having the kids as flower girls and the boys as page boys. A page boy outfit will cost around \u0026pound226 each, and flower girl dresses \u0026pound340. Groomswear – \u0026pound8,000 As a qualified Apache Helicopter Commander, Prince Harry is likely to be wearing a tailor-made Royal Air Force uniform to his wedding. He\u0027ll need to change later too, so a tuxedo or suit also needs to be bought. Hair and Makeup – \u0026pound10,000  Belgravia’s Neville Hair \u0026amp Beauty is a favourite of Meghan’s, or she may opt for Hannah Martin of Bobbi Brown and Richard Ward, who did Kate and Pippa’s wedding makeup and hair. Church Fees – \u0026pound175 The couple have to pay their fees just like everyone else.  Security - \u0026pound30m This is the most expensive elements of the day. A hefty \u0026pound30m was spent on Kate and Wills\u0027 big day so expect more of the same. While the wedding isn\u0027t in central London, there\u0027s still a huge number of members of the public attending. With the threats made against the couple ahead of the service, security is sure to be tight - with drones, snipers and undercover cops. There\u0027s a British counter-UAV system, costing \u0026pound1m, used to deactivate intruders and sneaky drones - including pap ones! Entertainment – \u0026pound55,000 This is mostly a guest. Expect the Royal Air Force to be in there somewhere, maybe some fireworks, entertainment for all those children... it all adds up The Honeymoon \u0026pound120,000  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly heading to the exotic country of Namibia for their honeymoon . Sources have also revealed that Meghan will be the one paying for the honeymoon as gift to the Prince and that the cost will be upwards of \u0026pound100,000.

Mr Shaw, 50, arrived to find Cameron Hull, 18, kissing one of his other daughters, and the teenager was given his marching orders, a court heard.   Hull was going to leave quietly but then realised he had forgotten his brand new jacket. When he went back to get it, he found the dad barring his entry and there was another bust-up in which Mr Shaw was punched in the face. Hull, who lives around six miles away from the Shaws\u0027 home in Langho, Lancashire, admitted assaulting the dad during the incident in March. He was handed a conditional discharge for eight months by Blackburn magistrates, and ordered to pay \u0026pound100 compensation.  Last night, the labourer claimed he and his pals did not know 21-year-old singer Ella\u0027s family lived at the home, the Daily Mail reports.   He reportedly said: We got invited to a party that night by the hostess’s friend. I did not know the name of the girl I was kissing. He added: We did not know it was Ella Shaw’s family place. Mike Church-Taylor, prosecuting, had told JPs that Mr Shaw had gone out with his wife but was keeping an eye on his home via the cam app. The prosecutor said: He saw four young men in the house and decided to go home. The four males ran from the house but the defendant then tried to get back in. Mr Shaw blocked his way and was punched in the face for his trouble. Damian Pickup, defending, said his client had never been in trouble with the police before and had been invited to the party.  He was kissing the girl when her parents returned home unexpectedly, said Mr Pickup. It is clear she had been told she could have a small party but it appears they didn\u0027t expect males to be there. My client says the girl\u0027s parents went mad and much of their anger was directed towards him because he had been kissing their daughter. Mr Shaw cornered the teenager, from Blackburn, and yelled at him before kicking him out of the house, the court heard. He realised he had left his brand new jacket in the house and returned to get it, said Mr Pickup. He was met with further aggression and accepts he punched the aggrieved in the face.

Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Junior, who are the children of Thomas Senior from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless. Her half-brother, however, has been in the spotlight recently, mostly down to his predictions the \u0026pound32m wedding won\u0027t end well. But who is Thomas Markle Jnr?  The half-brother of Meghan Markle, who share the same dad Thomas Markle Snr , may not have the best relationship with the future royal, but it wasn\u0027t always that way.  He was 14 when Meghan was born in 1981 after his father met Doria Ragland in the late 1970s. Thomas Jnr then grew up in the same household as his father, sister Samantha, step-mother Doria and half sister Meghan. Now living in Grant\u0027s Pass, Oregon, the window fitter is married to Darlene Blout and has two sons of his own.  While the world will watch his father walk Meghan down the aisle on May 19, Thomas Jnr will not attend her and Prince Harry \u0027s wedding. The 51-year-old has reportedly battled alcohol issues in the past and was arrested in 2017 for threatening his wife with a gun. On growing up with Meghan Meghan\u0027s father was a workaholic who already had two children from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless when he met Doria. According to his son Thomas Jnr, his life was to change when Meghan came along. “Before then, dad’s work took priority over everything, but she became his whole world,” he said. I remember when she came home from the hospital, he had decorated the bathroom with little angels and fairies.  His rocky relationship with Meghan Thomas has previously spoken exclusively to the Daily Mirror about the frosty relationship with Meghan. He said he was left \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 by the royal wedding snub and that fame had changed the American actress.  Thomas Jnr said: She’s clearly forgotten her roots. It’s torn my entire family apart. He added: Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family. She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person.  He told Harry to call the wedding off in a letter In an explosive open letter to Prince Harry, dated April 26, Thomas slammed his half-sister as a jaded, shallow and conceited woman. He blasted the wedding as a fake fairytale that would make a joke of you [Prince Harry] and the royal family heritage.  The letter, shared with In Touch Weekly magazine, reads: As more time passes to your royal wedding, it becomes very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history. Meghan is obviously not the right woman for you, the letter continues. I\u0027m confused why you don’t see the real Meghan that the whole world now sees. Meghan\u0027s attempt to act the part of a princess like a below C average Hollywood actress is getting old.  He also claimed their father is struggling financially after paying Meghan’s way at the start of her acting career and getting into debt. What kind of person starts out by using her own father until he\u0027s bankrupt, then forgets about him in Mexico leaving him broke, over mostly all her debts, the letter continued. And when it\u0027s time to pay him back she forgets her own father like she never knew him. It\u0027s very apparent that her tiny bit of Hollywood fame has gone to her head. Not to mention, to top it all off, she doesn\u0027t invite her own family and instead invites complete strangers to the wedding. Who does that?  Mr Markle finished with: Meghan is still my sister. She is family. So whatever happens is up to her, whether she wants to forget knowing me or the rest of her family, family comes first. Also, you would think that a royal wedding would bring a torn family closer together, but I guess we\u0027re all distant family to Meg. So... Is he invited to the wedding? According to numerous reports, he has not been invited to the wedding, with Meghan allegedly describing him as \u0027distant family.\u0027 Speaking to InTouch he said: “My attorney was reaching out to her people and the palace to basically [help us] try to get a retraction for all these false stories in [countries] where there are different laws.” He added: My lawyer had a phone meeting with her lawyer, and he emailed me some of [Meghan’s] direct words.  She said, ‘That’s distant family and I don’t know those people.’ That’s pretty harsh.” Mr Markle labelled her response as a “slap in the face” but admitted that the pair had not been in touch since Meghan moved to Toronto, Canada in 2011.  However, Thomas Jnr had said after news of the couple\u0027s relationship emerged that he had hoped to be invited to the wedding - and also hoped to invited his half-sister and Harry to his upcoming nuptials. He said at the time: It was just obvious from day one that she was destined to be somewhere really big. She\u0027s always been a princess. She\u0027s carried herself on that level from day one.” And he also defended Meghan, while slating his currently estranged full sister Samantha, who he believes is trying to ride Meghan’s coattails. She\u0027s battered this whole Meghan thing since day one and she\u0027s obviously doing this for her little flash in the pan fame and fortune. Telling the whole world about her pushy princess sister, which is just horrible [and] not even true,” he said.  His arrest and relationship with fiancee Darlene Thomas is due to get married himself this year to fiancee Darlene but the pair have had a tumultuous relationship. Darlene was arrested on New Year\u0027s Eve for allegedly attacking him in a drunken row . Thomas\u0027s fiancee Darlene spent last New Year\u0027s in jail after reportedly getting into a violent, drunken row with him. Police were called to the couple\u0027s home in Grants Pass, Oregon, around 20 minutes before midnight on December 31.  Darlene was booked on a charge of fourth-degree assault but prosecutors declined to take it any further. However, the charges were not pursued after Tom declined to assist. The year before, he was arrested on suspicion of holding a gun to his partner\u0027s head during another argument last year. The case was also dropped after Darlene refused to press charges. Speaking of his relationship with Darlene, he said: “I did get into to some trouble. It was a domestic altercation. The case was even dropped before it went to court. Darlene and I have always loved each other. “Darlene and I were actually made for each other so on her birthday we actually got engaged.

And former neighbour Julie Bushby, 48, did get a punch during their Bank Holiday reunion this week – a playful one on her arm as the pair bantered. Matthews, 43, told her: “I don’t hate you. You weren’t lying, just saying it as it was. In fact, I love you to bits.” Julie helped to get Matthews to confess to her part in daughter Shannon’s 2008 disappearance. She was in a police car with her, officer Christine Freeman and her pal Natalie Brown when the shamed mum admitted what she knew. Julie, a former chairman of the \u0026shyresidents association where the pair lived in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks, then gave evidence against her at her trial – and the judge praised her for her honesty.  As Matthews, who served four years of an eight-year jail sentence, met her in a park at the weekend, she said: “She’s been my friend from day one and she’s the only one who didn’t betray me when others did. I don’t hate her at all for it. “She just did what Julie does, she was straight and honest.” Reviled Matthews spoke to the Mirror this week in a bid to prove to the nation that she is not evil.  She even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to Shannon, who was found tied to a bed at accomplice Michael Donovan’s flat after a month-long search. Yet Matthews still denies her part in the sickening kidnap plot to cash in on the \u0026pound50,000 reward money. And pointing to other vile criminals, the mum-of-seven claims she was made a “scapegoat”, saying: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody. Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse I do.” Matthews did not recognise Julie until she said in her broad Yorkshire accent: “Hello, stranger.” Meeting at a secret location in the southern town she now lives in, Matthews told Julie: “It’s weird seeing you, it’s strange. But I’ve missed you.” The pair hugged before Julie, in her typical no-nonsense manner, challenged Matthews over fresh allegations about her having a 72-year-old sugar daddy and ripping off homeless people – which she denies. Julie teased: “So what’s this about you sh*gging an old man? You like them older, Karen, don’t ya! D’ya remember when you went out with [names a man], he was in his 60s or 70s.”  “I don’t remember him,” Matthews said, looking outraged. “But none of it’s true, Julie. He’s just a friend from work and I’m just so lonely and he was somebody to talk to. He’s nice to me.” She grimaced and pretended to be sick when asked if she had slept with him, saying: “I’m not interested in men at all. And I wouldn’t con homeless people. I’ve got a good heart really.” Leaving the park, the pair browsed charity shops together and popped into Poundstretcher. As they took a pleasure boat trip, Matthews waved to Bank Holiday sunbathers on the river bank while discussing her trial and catching up with gossip from her former home. Matthews told how she had never been on a boat before and Julie joked: “It’s all right, it might be your first and last time. I might throw you overboard!” Julie had to apologise frequently for forgetting to call Matthews by her new name, with the disgraced mum \u0026shyrepeatedly saying: “I don’t know her.” Matthews talked about her hobbies and told Julie how she enjoyed playing a colour by numbers game on her phone.  Julie laughed and said: “Anybody can colour in f***ing boxes, you want to try the real cross stitch. It’s very therapeutic.” As they passed luxurious back gardens along the river, Matthews said: “I wouldn’t like to live there, you’d have to fence it all off to keep the kids safe.” Julie, who was portrayed by Sheridan Smith in The Moorside, asked if Matthews had watched the hit BBC drama. “I did see bits of it but I didn’t like how they played me,” she said. She then added with a giggle: “But I thought that woman played you real good, Julie.” However, her smile vanished when the chat became more serious. Matthews told of her regrets at having missed her brother’s funeral because she was in jail, and her dad’s last year. And of mum June, who lives alone in West Yorkshire, she said: “She was a good mum, she did her best but we’re not in touch.” As the talk returned to her trial over Shannon’s kidnap, she said: “When they said ‘guilty’ to me in court, I was confused because I’d pleaded ‘not guilty!’. I hated sitting next to him [co-defendant Michael Donovan] in court. And then I got the same sentence as him and he’d drugged her. How can that happen?” Asked if she misses Dewsbury, she said: “I wouldn’t go back to Dewsbury, there’s nothing for me there... only Julie.” Julie laughed and said: “That’s all right, ’cos Dewsbury wouldn’t have you back anyway!” Mum-of-three Julie, who has seven grandchildren, is still living on the \u0026shyMoorside estate. She and Matthews were not best friends before Shannon vanished but knew each other and were at the same parenting classes. When Shannon went missing, Julie was one of the first people to offer help – organising the search, handing out posters and gathering people for candlelit vigils.

Parents Louise and David Turpin are now facing 42 charges including torture, false imprisonment and child abuse after allegedly shackling their children to a bed in California. The pair are accused of subjecting their brood to frequent beatings and even strangulation over the decades they were kept locked up in filthy conditions. The children had so little contact with the outside world, one reportedly didn\u0027t know what a police officer was.  When officers discovered their filthy living conditions at their home in Perris, in January this year, they were horrified. David Turpin 57, and Louise Turpin, 49, began tying the children up as a punishment many years ago, according to prosecutors. It allegedly began with one of the boys being tied to the bed with rope, but when he escaped they started using padlocks and chains to control their children. What happened to the Turpin children?  Police discovered the Turpin children living in horrifying conditions, with three children chained to a bed in Perris, California. The horrifying scenes were uncovered in January when one of the 13 children, aged 17, escaped before making a desperate bid to inform someone of the siblings left locked up. Seven of the Turpin\u0027s 12 remaining children in captivity were adults, with all their ages ranging from two to 29. The conditions in the filthy four-bedroom Perris home were said to be dark and foul smelling and the children and young adults were malnourished and dirty after years of captivity. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said: All 13 of the victims and defendants would typically sleep all day and be up through the night.  Starting many years ago, the victims would be tied up as punishment. These punishments would last for weeks or even months at a time. Police arrested both parents who are facing a total of 42 charges with a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 20. Several of the children were said to have cognitive impairment and nerve damage from extreme and prolonged physical abuse. Attorney Mike Hestrin added: None of victims were allowed to shower more than once a year. What happened to the children after their rescue?  Following their rescue, the children were taken to a police station where they were given food and drinks after they told officers they were starving. They were then taken to different hospitals for treatment and to be given to chance to wash. Police said the parents “were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner. After recovering in hospital, CNN reported the children are now happy living in three separate homes in Riverside County. Six of the children are minors and seven are adults.  The adults spent time in recovery at the Corona Regional Medical Centre hospital for two months. The centre\u0027s CEO Mark Uffer spoke about the moment they left hospital, saying There were some tears flowing, both for the staff and the Turpin children, he said. They said they loved us, they were going to miss us, they hoped to see us soon., reports CNN . All seven adults are now living in a home together. Two of the youngest children were put into foster care, while the remaining four are at another home after authorities struggled to find accommodation for all six together. The children are reportedly regularly in touch via Skype. How were the children discovered?  The children were discovered when a 17-year-old girl plotted her escape alongside others help in captivity. Early one Sunday morning, she climbed out of a window with a one of the younger children, before the younger child became frightened and turned back. The teenager managed to alert police by that 12 of her siblings remained in captivity. She used a deactivated mobile phone to call 911. Police at the time mistook her for a child aged around 10 due to her severe malnourishment. When police arrived at the house, it was reported the Turpins desperately attempted to untie two children shackled up at the time. The parents were immediately arrested.

As soon as I heard the idea I was so keen to get on to it.“I emailed the supervisor that day saying ‘I have to do this’.“I love robotics, I love programming, I love dogs and I love Doctor Who.“It’s a good mix of everything – it kept me really invested in the whole thing throughout the whole project.“He had a lot of water damage from a roof leak so all the electrics in him had just fried.“He was literally just a shell.”K9’s movements can be both tracked and controlled using a mobile app which Gary has specially created.The student, who lives in Dundee but is originally from Kirriemuir, worked on the project without the help of other students – but credits his lecturers with guiding him through it.He said: “It was a lot of work. If it wasn’t for the university lecturers helping me and guiding me along the way and showing me how to do things I’d be nowhere near finished.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"blow for dundee united as big two set to miss out","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt’s looking increasingly likely Dundee United will be dealt a double selection blow as they try to save their season at Livingston on Friday.Skipper Willo Flood is definitely out because of the red card he received as the Tangerines went down to Livi at Tannadice on Monday.And key man Bilel Mohsni also looks set to miss out because of the groin injury he picked up right at the end of that morale-sapping 3-2 play off defeat.Immediately after the final whistle gaffer Csaba Laszlo expressed his concern the nature of Mohsni’s injury meant the centre-half would not make the four-day turnaround between games.Two days on the Tunisian international is still struggling to recover.Given his influence on the defence since he arrived March, his absence would be a major setback.“I don’t think in this short time he will be recovered but we are a team and we have to show also that we can stand up,” said Csaba.Mark Durnan is a ready-made replacement for the 30-year-old but problems with an ankle injury mean he hasn’t started a game since the win over champions St Mirren a month ago.Meanwhile, the first of Flood’s two bookings on Monday means he will miss the start of next season under the totting up process.Although United have already lost twice a Livingston this season, the manager still believes they can overcome the 3-2 deficit from the first leg.“It is only one goal and we can win,” added Csaba.“If a chance comes we must take it, this is important.”Friday night’s game will be pay-at-the-gate for both sets of supporters.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/06/iStock_93378327_MEDIUM.jpg ","title":"brewery backs popular local beer festival this

game\u0026#8217s only goal but Elliott Parish was Dundee\u0026#8217s hero, saving a late Dougie Imrie penalty to all but confirm Premiership safety.Neil McCann\u0026#8217s side took the lead on 18 minutes with their first clear-cut chance of the game.Excelling on his comeback trail, Craig Wighton left Accies full-back Shaun Want wanting as he delivered a low cross into the box from the left.Holt paused to gather the ball from behind him, which sat up nicely, and unleashed a stinging left-foot volley beyond Gary Woods in the Hamilton goal.The Dark Blues dominated the rest of the first-half with Simon Murray and Steven Caulker both going close with headers.Just before the half-time whistle, captain for the day Paul McGowan picked up a bouncing loose ball from 30 yards and sent a dipping volley dangerously towards Woods but the goalie did well to gather.Lewis Spence replaced Mark O\u0026#8217Hara at the break, who lost his two front teeth after a collision with Danny Redmond on 10 minutes, and showed up well in the middle of the park.The Dee picked up where they left off in the opening period, completely controlling the second 45.Wighton continued to pose the biggest danger for the home side, jinking down the left past his new marker Darren Lyon on several occasions.His best effort came on 53 minutes, cutting inside onto his favoured right to send a raking drive in for sub keeper Ryan Fulton to save.The game became scrappy with both teams picking up yellow cards left, right and centre before Cammy Kerr sprung into life on a surging run down the right on 65 minutes.Murray did well to hold up the ball before slipping in his fellow Dundonian who fell at the final hurdle with the goal gaping.After a back and forth period, the worst happened on 85 minutes when 19-year-old substitute Daniel Jefferies, making his debut, fouled Marios Ogkmpoe in the box.Referee Steven McLean pointed to the spot and Dougie Imrie stepped up to take.However, his penalty was saved by Dee keeper Elliott Parish.Dundee held on to all but confirm Premiership survival.

We just need to concentrate on ourselves.“We’re in a better position than Ross County and Partick so it’s still in our hands.With striker Sofien Moussa a doubt for the Premiership fixture lunchtime fixture, Murray could be deployed in a central attacking role rather than out wide – where he has played in recent weeks.Murray says he is comfortable with that and ready to start firing again after a sticky spell in front of goal, saying: “I’m happy to play anywhere but, obviously, I’m a striker and I want to be in the box through the middle.“Hopefully, I can get the nod and whether it’s up on my own or with a partner I’m happy to be out there.“The most important thing is to play well and get the result.“I’ve been creating chances and getting my shots off, whether the keepers have been saving them or I’ve been missing the target, I’ve been getting into the areas and I felt like some of my performances are just missing a goal now.“I feel like I’ve been playing well but just not getting the goal.

However, six months later he is still waiting for a transplant.People on the transplant list can be contacted at any time to say there is an organ available for them — and Nadir was ecstatic when he received a call to say a potential donor kidney had been found.However, his joy turned to agony when he awoke from the anaesthetic to find that doctors had cancelled the operation because the donor kidney had been damaged.He said: “We drove down to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and I was obviously really nervous. They put me on dialysis and told me surgery would be around 8am.“I was taken off dialysis at 11pm and went back to my bed. My parents were staying in accommodation provided by the hospital.“I couldn’t sleep until about 5am because I was so nervous and excited.“The surgeon visited me an hour before the operation and told me the kidney wasn’t a perfect match but it was still pretty good.“He asked me formally if I wanted to go ahead. I was wheeled into the operating theatre and they put me under anaesthetic. I went under thinking, ‘this is it’.“They woke me up two hours later and a nurse told me that the operation didn’t go ahead because the kidney was damaged.“They took me back up to the ward and I was being sick along the way because I was still under the influence of the anaesthetic.“I was upset when I woke up properly and they said I could stay the night but I just went home as soon as I could since I really didn’t want to stay there after what had happened.“I was really upset on the way home but I tried not to show it.”Anyone willing to be tested to see if they are a match to donate an organ to Nadir can contact a living donation co-ordinator at Ninewells Hospital on 01382 633897 or email robbie.paul@nhs.net.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/31956475_10215998158964634_3954302893946830848_n-e1525777205756-403x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people are you heading to the linlathen high school reunion in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRemember the \u0026#8220rocket\u0026#8221 at Linlathen High School?

both drank in the shared room at the Marriot Hotel in the city but their antics led to police being called to the room by hotel staff.The teen was then detained — despite Dr Fearn’s pleas for officers to reconsider as he was judged to be a “suicide risk” in confined places.Police in attendance observed that Dr Fearn appeared to be under the influence or smelling of alcohol in the presence of her vulnerable young charge.She only informed care bosses about the incident the next day, while driving back to Scotland.There was no suggestion of an “intimate” relationship between the pair but the Health and Care Professions Tribunal Service (HCPTS) said there was “no doubt that there was a total blurring of boundaries”.At her tribunal hearing last year, Dr Fearn avoided being expelled from her profession.Instead, the HCPTS gave her a 12-month conditions of practice order, requiring Dr Fearn, who has since left her job at St Mary’s Kenmure, to tell the Health and Care Professions Council if she got a new position.For the last year, she has also been required to work only with service users over the age of 18 and to disclose her restrictions to potential new employers.The review hearing is set to take place in Glasgow on May 22.Dr Fearn was unavailable for comment at the time of going to press.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af2bc32d30b4-423x564.jpg ","title":"heres why cameras have been installed at busy dundee car

mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann hailed a “magnificent” defensive display from his side as they laid to rest any relegation worries with a 1-0 win at Ross County.Going into the game in Dingwall, the Dark Blues were still not mathematically assured of survival, with Partick Thistle six points behind with two games to play.In the end, Thistle’s defeat at home to Motherwell meant Dundee would be safe anyway.However, Neil and his players wanted to get the job done themselves and did so thanks to Simon Murray’s 51st-minute header.Neil said: “It’s always a horrible position to be in.“I came into the job in this sort of position last season and it wasn’t enjoyable but we did the business pretty quickly in our first three games but Tuesday night it was still rolling on.“We wanted to do it off our own back, under our own steam and win the game.“I felt Ross County were the better side in the first 20 minutes, we started getting our foot on the ball and began to play a wee bit.“I was unhappy with them at half-time with the start of the game and, indeed, at the start of the second we coughed up a chance.“However, when we play we know we are a difficult side to contain and we were always looking to hit them on the break once we got the first goal.”With their own survival at stake, the Staggies were desperate for a goal that could give them a lifeline.The Dundee defence, though, held firm.Neil added: “I thought we defended magnificently well in the second half as they threw everything at it. There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Michael-Higgins-BigWeekend.jpg ","title":"parking at bbc biggest weekend in tayside to cost more than tickets to event","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOrganisers of this month’s Biggest Weekend concert at Scone Palace have been blasted over parking charges that will cost more than the tickets.Frustrated music lover Michael Higgins, 61, from Montrose, has vowed to give away his ticket and warned other fans could follow suit.Mr Higgins was planning to travel to the event on Saturday May 26 to watch Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds and a host of other top music acts.But those plans were cut short after he realised he would need to pay £17 — including booking fees — to park. It is understood fans who wait a further two weeks to book their spot will be charged £20, making the cost of parking more than the event ticket price.Mr Higgins, who said he was impressed by the value of the Biggest Weekend itself, called on organisers to explain how they can justify such charges.He said: “I think charging that much for parking is utterly obscene.“I think it really raises questions over who this money is going to and why the charges are so high.”Perth and North Perthshire MP and musician Pete Wishart said he had “serious concerns” people would stay away as a result of the fees.“Charging excessive fees like this does nothing to promote Scone Palace as a great music destination,” he said. “I would encourage them to think again regarding these exorbitant fees.”A spokeswoman for Scone Palace said: “The parking rates are consistent with those at other Biggest Weekend events throughout the UK.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/06/grob-carnoustie-gala020.JPG.jpg ","title":"pipe band contest in city square%e2%80%8b","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Dundee, Perth and Angus branch of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association will host the 2nd Dundee City Pipe Band contest this weekend in the city centre.The competition will see pipers performing throughout the day in City Square from 11am-4.40pm on Sunday.The day will conclude with a massed bands and prizegiving.Competitors include pipe bands from MacKenzie Caledonian and City of Discovery from Dundee, Glasgow’s Lomond and Clyde, three bands from Dollar Academy, Vale of Atholl, the High School of Dundee and RAF Central Scotland Pipes and Drums from Fife.The competition is free to observe for spectators.The full contest draw can be found at rspba-dpa.org.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed former dundee school set to be sold for housing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former school is likely to be sold for housing, the Tele can reveal.It is understood councillors are being asked to approve the sale of the former Downfield Primary School to a city developer for half a million poundsMembers of Dundee City Council’s city development committee will be asked next week to consider plans to develop the site on East School Road.Discussion about the proposed development is to be held in private at the meeting on Monday.The Tele has learned that Aberkell Developments from Kellas, on the outskirts of Dundee, is the preferred bidder to develop housing on the site.A source told the Tele that it is being recommended that Aberkell buys the land for just over £500,000.It is understood that the proposals are for 14 properties on the site — five houses and nine flats.The former Downfield School annexe in East School Road has already been identified as a potential housing development with space for 25 new homes.Aberkell has been behind the redevelopment of several other buildings in Dundee.Last month it lodged an application for planning permission to build three two-storey houses and convert a care home into three flats and extend the building to accommodate a further four flats, as well as construct a car park in Rankine Street.In January, the company was also granted permission to demolish a property in the city and replace it with three new houses.The plans involved demolishing a house at 48 Adelaide Place in the Law area and creating three detached two-storey homes.At the end of 2016, the company was also behind plans to convert a former health clinic on Dudhope Terrace into housing.It proposed the subdivision of the clinic into four residential flats.Aberkell Developments was formed in 2016.There are two directors — Gregory Davie and Stephen Mulgrew.The company is based at Gagie Holdings, Kellas.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish football pays tribute to legendary dundee football writer ron scott","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish football has paid tribute to a respected and popular Dundee sports writer  who has died after a short illness.Ron Scott, a former chief football writer at the Sunday Post passed away in Ninewells Hospital on Sunday.
