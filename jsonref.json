The ASA added: “In addition, some well-known airlines did not appear on the chart, so it was not clear whether they had been measured.”The ASA also said that the ads failed to factor in seating density – the number of seats per plane – which it considered “significant information that consumers needed in order to understand the basis of the claim”.The ASA banned the ads ruling that they were misleading because the airline had failed to substantiate its environmental claims.“The ads must not appear again in their current forms,” the ASA said. “We told Ryanair to ensure that when making environmental claims they held adequate evidence to substantiate them and to ensure that the basis of those claims were made clear.”The environmental group Transport \u0026amp Environment accused Ryanair of greenwashing instead of tackling its emissions.The airline ran the low-emissions ad campaign just over five months after it became the first non-coal company to be named in the EU top 10 carbon emitters list.“Ryanair should stop greenwashing and start doing something to tackle its sky-high emissions,” said Jo Dardenne, the aviation manager of T\u0026ampE.Ryanair remained defiant, claiming it had abided by the UK advertising code.“Ryanair is both disappointed and surprised that the ASA has issued this ruling given that Ryanair fully complied with advertising regulations, engaging with regulators and providing documentation that fulfilled all the substantiations needed,” said a spokeswoman.The Ryanair boss, Michael O’Leary, has suggested shooting environmentalists and has repeatedly denied that the climate crisis is driven by carbon emissions, which aviation produces in abundance.Last year, Ryanair claimed it was already the greenest airline in terms of carbon emissions per passenger. The company has also pledged to be “plastic free” by 2023 and set up a voluntary carbon offset payment scheme for customers when booking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/250f7dc23a9f518c4cbbf50cf77f02709a25b009/26_169_3443_2066/master/3443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc5afa1568fc87739e9a8135b2db322","title":"vodafone to remove huawei from core european networks","story":"Move will cost €200m over five years but have limited financial impact on UK operationsVodafone is to remove Huawei equipment from the sensitive, core parts of its mobile networks across Europe at a cost of €200m (£169m) over the next five years.The group, which has 111 million customers across Europe, has taken the decision after the UK government’s move last week to limit the use of Huawei equipment in the country’s 5G network.Nick Read, Vodafone’s chief executive, said the Huawei equipment replacement programme would have “very limited financial impact” on its UK operations as they are already mostly compliant with the new government measures.Read said that if caps were introduced by other countries Vodafone would look to ert money intended for rolling out 5G to the wider replacement of Huawei equipment.Read stressed that no European nations had indicated at this stage that they intended to introduce caps but because the UK had done so, Vodafone wanted to make its position clear on the potential impact.“We need to be rolling out 5G to underpin a competitive landscape in a digital society.

We asked writers in four EU capitals what their government’s will prioritiseThe German government is bracing itself for tough negotiations. Berlin sees the UK’s decision to put a 31 December time limit on the process as a tactical manoeuvre by Boris Johnson, calculated to step up the pressure on the EU towards the end of 2020. Germany holds the EU presidency until the end of December and will have to oversee negotiations on the next EU budget, which will involve juggling increasingly difficult demands. It will also be the last major test for Chancellor Angela Merkel, coming shortly before she leaves office in 2021.According to officials, a bare-bones EU-UK trade agreement that obviates only the introduction of customs duties and import quotas is fully negotiable within this time. If the agreement touches only on areas the EU has sole responsibility for, it will be quickly ratified. Greater difficulties arise in what are known as “mixed” agreements, where member states themselves also retain power. Here, national or even regional parliaments must agree, and ratification can take at least two years.The German government no longer expects agreement on the “level playing field” provisions (outlawing competition by undercutting EU standards). London is unlikely to automatically submit to EU rules. Still, Berlin is determined not to allow EU environmental protection standards, social policies or data protection to be undermined. For that reason a new legal idea is being examined, one that would allow for a close UK connection with the single market. This, however, would involve an enormous amount of bureaucracy for British industry. What is at issue here is the so-called principle of equivalence. The EU can decree that the regulations applied by a non-EU state have equal value to those applying under community law. Once this is established, the EU can grant free access to the single market.This principle is already used in the implementation of EU law by the member states. States must not treat EU law as inferior to national law, and must prove it. Applied to the UK post-Brexit, this would mean that the British side is responsible for the proper implementation of EU rules, and would have to provide evidence they have done so. Should they fail, there would be a price to pay in terms of market access or tariffs.However, German politics is ided on how harshly the UK should be treated. Given the scale of the UK’s economic interdependence with the EU, the German government expects quick solutions in areas such as research, science, education, security and military cooperation. At the same time, it doesn’t want to make Brexit a model for others – there must be clear advantages to EU membership, or so it is argued.Germany is eagerly awaiting a more detailed British negotiating mandate – Johnson’s speech in Greenwich this week didn’t amount to one. Will he maintain his generally unpredictable political style or take his lead from the domestic UK political mood? The German chancellor is said to still have great sympathy with the British, but she has not forgotten how Johnson treated her on the way to his election victory last year.• Stefan Kornelius writes for Süddeutsche ZeitungSpain knows the road ahead won’t be easy. The levels of bilateral economic interdependence, both trading and financial, are intense. Both nations have hundreds of thousands of citizens working and living in each other’s territories. Tourism – some 19 million British tourists visit Spain every year, where they spend about €13.3bn – fishing, agriculture and aviation are all big sectors. And of course, looming large is the Rock of Gibraltar, the British colony that Spain aspires, some day, to recover.Spain is Britain’s second biggest trading partner in the EU and the most popular for British people who move to live in continental Europe. There are currently about 370,000 British residents, and not all of them are retired. Half are under the age of 59. The UK is also the top residential destination for Spaniards: almost 200,000 of them have made their home in Britain.The UK withdrawal agreement seems to have shielded the rights of these people, including their professional qualifications, pensions and health coverage, but many questions remain around labour and mobility rights. “Spain will be very forceful in protecting these rights,” says its foreign affairs ministry. Spain, as a new net contributor to the EU, will have more power to flex its muscles on this point in the coming year.From now, however, everything depends on how the UK plays its cards. Madrid is willing to make the agreement as broad as possible, but if London insists on erging from EU rules – for instance, by making it difficult for people to move back and forth, undercutting regulations and detaching from the internal market – Spain will stand firm with Michel Barnier’s position. And if that happens, the British will find it very difficult to move, sell their services and do business on the continent.Gibraltar is, perhaps, the most emotional issue for both sides. The governments are currently finalising an agreement to prevent Gibraltar from becoming a tax haven. “This agreement will be final,” say Spanish diplomatic sources. It will be added to four memorandums covering the environment, tobacco prices - to deter smuggling – police cooperation and workers’ rights. The goal is for the current situation to change as little as possible. Some 8,000 Spaniards work in Gibraltar and some 200 trucks cross the frontier every day. Spain won’t necessarily use the EU negotiations with Britain to improve its negotiating position on Gibraltar, but it aspires to a shared sovereignty that could begin with joint management of the airport.Yet the challenge is enormous, and Madrid worries that a nationalist and populist political agenda in London could jeopardise the chances of a positive outcome.• Xavier Mas de Xaxàs writes for La VanguardiaFar from having any sense of schadenfreude, the French view the UK’s departure from the EU with sadness, convinced, as Michel Barnier says, that this is a lose-lose situation: bad for the UK and bad for the rest of Europe, just when it needs to be strong in an unstable world.Yet a certain sense of relief is tangible on this side of the Channel: the Brexit saga went on for too long, monopolising the EU’s time for three and a half years when there were so many other urgent matters to deal with. It had to be resolved.Now the situation is just a little bit clearer. Serious talks can finally begin: we can start to discuss the future. Everyone in Paris, as in Brussels, feels that negotiations on the future relationship are likely to be heated, especially as the UK seems to want to take advantage of quitting to free itself of EU rules and standards. For the EU, there is simply no question of accepting that regulatory ergence can be a prelude to social, environmental or fiscal “dumping” by Britain. As Barnier says: “The access British goods have to the single market will be proportional to Britain’s commitments,” adding, “zero tariffs, zero quotas and zero dumping.”The French would like the future relationship to be as close as possible, while at the same time leaving the UK in no doubt that being a “third” (or non-EU) country is always less advantageous than being a fully paid-up member. In Paris, there are fears that a successful Brexit will be seized on by French Eurosceptics, starting with Marine Le Pen – something that would augur badly for Macron in the presidential election in 2022. This is an argument against rushing the negotiations, even if it means rejecting the timetable that Boris Johnson seeks with his self-imposed deadline of 31 December 2020.At this point, given the inability of Johnson’s team to provide the rest of Europe with much precision on what he wants the UK to look like once Brexit is “done”, the French can only speculate. Paris will seek to revive bilateral ties not covered by the trade agreement. In defence and security in particular, the French believe they can maintain strong links with the UK. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Lancaster House defence treaties, and neither side’s military has any desire to part company with the other.There is a precedent for such cooperation in the European Intervention Initiative, launched two years ago by Macron as the precursor to a rapid intervention force. Anticipating Brexit, and anxious not to let France’s best military partner in Europe drift away, he made sure Britain was involved from the start in a collaboration that was European but outside the EU. Deep down, the French expect that, with the help of global disorder and Donald Trump, the UK will quickly realise that its interest is to remain in the EU’s orbit.• Sylvie Kauffmann and Philippe Ricard write for Le MondeThe Italian strategy on Brexit has three pillars: the rights of 600,000 Italian citizens living in the UK, protecting trade, and security and defence cooperation. Over the next 11 months of negotiations on the future relationship, Rome doesn’t intend to budge from these priorities.However, Italy will seek to advance its interests, according to sources in the foreign ministry, while avoiding “predatory attitudes”. “Every country has its own interests to safeguard or reinforce,” says Marco Peronaci, Italy’s Brexit special envoy. “For example: Paris wants to secure fishing rights for Luxembourg, it is finance the Netherlands, logistics.” The thinking in diplomatic circles is that if a predatory attitude were to prevail among the 27 – one of “sharing out the spoils” – it would lead to trouble. Italy wants to keep things in balance. Peronaci emphasises that cutting London adrift wouldn’t help anybody.“From the outset we’ve been using the English expression ‘level playing field’, precisely to avoid misunderstandings,” says one of the politicians closest to the trade negotiations. And while Italy might have been happier with a longer negotiation on the future relationship, it is resigned to the 31 December end date: “We’ll see to it that this timeframe is used to its best advantage.”Immediately after the Brexit referendum in 2016, Italy set up an ad-hoc taskforce, coordinated by the prime minister’s office. One source laments the EU’s lack of “cunning” in its dealings with Theresa May. “Winning the negotiations doesn’t always mean you end up with the best possible situation,” he says. This is a reference to the Northern Ireland backstop and, above all, the customs union, contained in the deal negotiated by May but defeated three times in Westminster. “Now with Johnson’s agreement we’re starting out with a more complicated situation, at least for the Italians, who want to see our interests represented in a relationship with London that’s very like the one we have at present.”As to security, both internal and external, existing cooperation mechanisms are plainly going to be lost. So it’s important, both for Italy and the other EU countries, that similar mechanisms replace them. One intelligence officer says that keeping channels open for the exchange of data and information – on terrorism and security policies, for instance – is crucial. Italy (and Europe) can’t do without London in this respect, and, for as long as the UK is part of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance, finding a way of relating to this structure in new and advantageous ways is seen in Rome as the definitive challenge.• Francesca Sforza and Alberto Simoni write for La StampaBritain knows it has taken a leap in the dark by ending its 47-year relationship with the EU. The orce took more than three years, but Boris Johnson has given his negotiating team only 11 months to forge an enduring new settlement.Already there have been wobbles in the British cabinet about the extent to which it wants the UK economy to erge from the European model.Johnson has never truly revealed his brand of Euroscepticism. In order to secure the withdrawal agreement, he largely accepted the form of Northern Ireland backstop first offered by Brussels. But that episode only revealed his pragmatic determination to achieve Brexit.He played to the Eurosceptic gallery to win the leadership of the Conservative party. But is he prepared to inflict the economic shock to the UK of a looser trading relationship with Europe in pursuit of maximum political sovereignty? He has a large Commons majority, but there are constraints. His new cadre of “blue wall” MPs in England’s Midlands and northern regions will see their constituents suffer most if barriers to trade are erected in 2021.The more barriers start to rise, the more onerous the border checks will be on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Britain into Northern Ireland. The more Northern Ireland looks damaged by Brexit, the louder will be the demands for Scottish independence. Business, agriculture and manufacturing will raise the alarm at the sight of European markets disappearing behind a wall of tariffs. The risk then becomes that Brexit looks like a project for English south.For the first few months of this year, before the talks start in earnest in late spring, Johnson will be able to avoid hard choices. But at some point he will have to acknowledge that frictionless trade and full political sovereignty are incompatible. Downing Street believes its diplomatic cards will produce compromise. Brussels will not want a deregulated behemoth on its doorstep. The collective discipline the EU showed in the first round of talks may be tested. The UK also believes that Germany and France, needing British defence assets, want to cooperate with the UK on defence. On foreign policy the EU 3 group, deployed in policymaking over Iran and Libya, makes Britain a necessary partner for Europe.UK officials believe national capitals will be more assertive this year – especially if, for instance, central European states, locked in difficult EU budget talks, feel France is being too tough. Moreover, the threat of other countries going down the Brexit route has diminished. The EU’s very survival is no longer at stake, especially if Johnson does not play the role of disruptor that Trump might like. The Foreign Office thinks that France, for wider issues of security, will in any case want to cooperate.Britain may not share Emmanuel Macron’s exasperation with Nato or American isolationism, and it would greatly alarm Poland – Britain’s greatest ally in the EU – if it did. But Macron’s call for a stronger EU defence pillar gives the UK an entry point into the discussion on future European defence.• Patrick Wintour is diplomatic editor for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5ff04fbaa706bdc891a5b0a3d4b671c5e13340/207_84_2687_1612/master/2687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e0038808b0e16609d3f4e2e39d18cca","title":"try to stop me the mantra of our leaders who are now ruling with impunity","story":"Trump, Bolsonaro, Modi, Johnson. Across the world, flouting the law has become normalised. We have to stop itIt is not a sufficient condition for fascism to take root, but it is a necessary one: the willingness of political leaders not only to break the law but to revel in breaking it is a fatal step towards the replacement of democracy with authoritarian terror.We see this at work in the United States today, where the Republican party’s blatant disregard for the constitution will allow Donald Trump to escape impeachment.If Trump is elected for a second term, he will test to the limit the potential for wielding unconstitutional power. But the phenomenon is not confined to the US. Several powerful governments now wear illegality almost as a badge of honour.Fascist and prefascist governments share, among others, two linked characteristics: they proudly flout the laws that are supposed to restrain them while introducing new, often unconstitutional laws to contain political opponents or oppress minorities.In Brazil, outrages against indigenous people, opposition politicians and journalists are encouraged and celebrated at the highest levels of government. Jair Bolsonaro won the presidential election with the help of a judicial coup in which due process was abandoned to secure the imprisonment of the frontrunner, Luiz Inácio da Silva (Lula). Bolsonaro has been photographed embracing two of the suspects in the murder of the leftwing councillor Marielle Franco, and has sought to block corruption investigations into his son Flávio, who allegedly has close links with members of the paramilitary gang accused of killing her.In response to democratic protests, Brazil’s economy minister has threatened to impose martial law. Bolsonaro has called for the police to execute suspected criminals: “These guys are going to die in the streets like cockroaches – and that’s how it should be.” His racist comments about indigenous people, and curtailment of the agencies supposed to protect them, could help explain a new spate of murders by loggers, miners and ranchers. Human rights groups are urging the international criminal court to investigate Bolsonaro for incitement to genocide.The investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has published explosive reports about corruption and crime in Bolsonaro’s government, and his husband, the leftwing congressman and  columnist David Miranda, have received repeated death threats, containing details about their lives that only the state could know. Greenwald has now been spuriously charged with cybercrimes.In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after discovering that his alleged association with the 2002 Gujarat massacres no longer appeared to tarnish his name, is laying the foundations for a vicious ethno-nationalism. His new citizenship law deliberately denies rights to Muslims and could render millions of people stateless. People protesting against this act are brutally attacked by the police. Police and armed gangs have raided two Delhi universities, randomly beating up students, to spread generalised terror. In Uttar Pradesh, political opponents are routinely imprisoned without charge and tortured.Modi has ripped up the constitution to annex Jammu and Kashmir. The police have fired on people protesting peacefully against this illegal action, blinding some of them with shotgun pellets. Political leaders have been arrested and communications shut down. Officials treat this illegality as a brutal joke. Haryana’s chief minister, Manohar Lal Khattar – a close Modi ally – boasts that “now we will bring girls from Kashmir”, as colonial booty.The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has bragged of riding around the streets of Davao on his motorbike when he was mayor of the city, shooting people he suspected of being criminals. Since becoming president he has, in effect, turned the police into a giant death squad, empowering them to murder people they believe to be involved in drug crime. Unsurprisingly, this general licence has led to the murders of political opponents, and land and environmental defenders.Even as he applauds the killing of drug suspects, Duterte jokes about taking illegal drugs to keep himself awake at international summits. Opponents are imprisoned, judges are sacked and replaced, journalists are prosecuted on trumped-up charges. The imposition of martial law on the island of Mindanao is used to crush dissent objectors are treated as terrorists and murdered.Like these other killer clowns, Trump may now feel he can do anything. His legal team has in the past suggested he has total immunity, boasting that he could literally get away with murder. A culture of impunity is spreading around the world. “Try to stop me” is the implicit motto in nations ranging from Hungary to Israel, Saudi Arabia to Russia, Turkey to China, Poland to Venezuela. Flaunting your disregard for the law is an expression of power.It’s happening in the UK too, though so far on a smaller scale. The Brexit vote, which eventually enabled Boris Johnson to take office, was secured with the help of blatant illegality. The government intends to carry out a legislative cleansing of Romany Gypsies and Travellers, knowing that this offends our own Equality Act, and is likely to lead to a case before the European court of human rights. It’s almost as if it welcomes the confrontation.These are experiments in absolutism. They don’t amount to fascism in their own right. But in conjunction with the elevation of preposterous and desperate men, the denigration of minorities and immigrants, political violence, mass surveillance and widespread mockery of liberalism and social justice, they suggest that some countries, separately and together, are beginning to head towards the darkest of all political places.The normalisation of impunity is possibly the most important step towards authoritarian rule. Never let it be normal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80bc18d23ac1f56d55270cafb0ac0da21670d5a3/0_116_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5048f7301d6e81e28ad7a1215406552e","title":"south african photographer santu mofokeng in pictures","story":"The documentary photographer, best known for recording everyday life in the townships of South Africa, has died.

The government has my backing as they go forward.”Asked about his relationship with Johnson, Cameron declined to answer. Lord Barker of Battle, who served as an energy and climate change minister under Cameron and is a close friend and ally of the former prime minister, told BBC Two’s Newsnight on Tuesday that he understood Cameron felt “it was just a little too soon for him personally to come back into a frontline political role”.The former Conservative leader William Hague was also reported to have been offered it and to have also declined.On Tuesday during the conference’s launch event, Johnson refused to answer questions about who would take on the job.The former clean growth minister Claire O’Neill, who stood down as a Tory MP at the general election, was sacked on Friday as president of the talks by the prime minister’s special adviser, Dominic Cummings. The government said the post would be a ministerial role in future.The UN climate talks, to be held in Glasgow in November, are the most important since the Paris agreement to curb global warming was secured in 2015.Countries are expected to deliver more ambitious domestic plans for cutting greenhouse gases by 2030, as current proposals are not enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises.Pressure is also on countries to set out long-term plans for cutting emissions, with the science clear that the world must reduce greenhouse gases to zero in a matter of decades to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.The run-up to the talks will require a major diplomatic effort from the UK to secure ambitious climate action from countries, at a time when Britain is also negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other nations.On Tuesday Johnson set out his vision for forging a new global consensus on the climate crisis, promising “we will crack it”.Johnson has brought forward the UK’s phaseout of diesel and petrol vehicles by five years to 2035 and hastened the phaseout of coal-fired power by a year to 2024. He reaffirmed the UK’s pledge to switch to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 and urged other nations – without naming any – to do the same.“I hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero within decades,” Johnson said at the COP 26 launch on Tuesday. “We’re going to do it by 2050, we’re setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us. Let’s make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve manmade climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d83a51aa1e829ebe30f2490da62227ad89c08b/518_160_4868_2921/master/4868.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=376264cda84792116bba23ed7f034d77","title":"neneh cherry look i love judy blame raw like sushi","story":"The singer recalls the outfit she wore for the cover of her 1989 debut album Raw Like Sushi and the ‘privilege’ of working with the stylist Judy BlameI think a lot of the best looks can happen by accident and this was a coincidental look. The picture was taken by Jean-Baptiste Mondino in Paris in 1989 and styled by Judy Blame. We had done a photo session for my single Manchild, with the boxing bandages and the jewellery, and when we needed to shoot the cover for my debut album, Raw Like Sushi, we thought: “Let’s work some more with that.”We had a bunch of rails with things to wear, but Judy and I had been to Printemps – like a French version of Marks \u0026amp Spencer – and I had bought a nice bra, and I was wearing leggings, which were from Pineapple or somewhere. I went out to test the light and Mondino was like: “Don’t put anything else on. Maybe some more jewellery.” Then we did the picture that ended up being the album cover. In the same session I wore some BodyMaps shorts, which are in the pictures that ended up on the back and the inside, but it was a really non-wardrobe thing in the end.I have always felt that visuals are a very important part of telling a story. For a woman, this was quite a male visual. The boxing wraps were a metaphor for being here to fight the fight.In 1988, I had just come back from Jamaica when I performed on Top of the Pops while seven months pregnant. I wore some dollar-sign earrings I had bought while I was there and snakeskin trainers. Judy would pull things out for me to wear – people like Rifat Ozbek. He always had his hand on the pulse.

In 1928, the automobile magnate Walter P Chrysler set out to create the greatest skyscraper on Earth, but the record for the world’s tallest building was held for only 11 months before it was overshadowed by the Empire State Building. The terraced crown that is the Chrysler’s most distinctive feature – a seven-storey decorative shell without floors or glazed windows – was dismissed by critics as a gimmick.But, in 2020, the Chrysler is the height of fashion. It has become an architectural icon, a beloved art deco treasure, as symbolic of Manhattan as the Eiffel Tower is of Paris. And the signature silhouette – the elegant, wedding-cake tiers, graphic but graceful, tapering skyward – is the most on-trend shape. The tiered dress is to fashion today what the hourglass was during the New Look craze of 1947 or what the bellbottom was to 1971. The first trend of the new decade is here – and it is 2os skyscraper chic.You may be wearing this dress already without realising how cutting edge you are. In its wearable, everyday form, it has a simple neckline and skims the body to the waist, where it connects to a waist-to-hip tier with a little more fabric, so that the silhouette gets looser and a little wider. A little lower, there is another horizontal seam and a lower tier with yet more fabric, and so on, to the hem. The fabric is soft and unstructured, so that the shape falls with a natural gravity, rather than a grand, stiff kind of volume.The Chrysler silhouette crosses all fashion ides. It was a key look for fashion’s biggest labels in their first collections of this decade. There was a monochrome gown at Chanel, with white buttons on a white bodice and a floor-length skirt of three tiers of black organza. At Dior, a polka-dot sheer dress was embroidered at the horizontal seams iding the four stacked layers of the skirt, to emphasise the tiered construction.Tiers were everywhere, from the avant garde catwalk of Simone Rocha – where overlapping layers of black lace were worn with a crochet harness and a latex skullcap – to Óscar de la Renta, the favourite label of New York’s socialites, where a floral, floor-length gown in tiers of cream and caramel, with matching belt and bag, was garden-party perfect.What is remarkable about the popularity of the Chrysler shape is that this dress does not make you look thin. It does not emphasise the waist, nor does it slim your silhouette. It simply does not kowtow to the age-old tyranny of thinness in fashion. This makes it supremely relaxing to wear – you can breathe out, literally – which lends it a laid-back kind of mood-music when you wear it. They say that flattery will get you everywhere, but the triumph of the tiered dress shows that, in fashion, this is no longer the case. “Flattering” is no longer the be-all and end-all of compliments, from a style point of view. There is a modern take on dressing up that is more about glamour and less about sex appeal.The first noteable on-screen appearance of a tiered dress in modern pop culture came in Killing Eve, in the form of the pink Molly Goddard frock worn by Villanelle. It was an unforgettable fashion moment precisely because the aesthetic impact was so unsettling. Traditionally, sugar-pink is the most feminine of colours, an international aesthetic code for conventional prettiness. But splayed on the sofa in her giant triangular dress, Villanelle had all the cockiness of a man-spreader on a tube carriage. The natural successor to Villanelle was Gemma Chan at last year’s Oscars, with one hand in the pocket – pocket! – of her Valentino gown, which was constructed in 12 horizontal layers of hot-pink parachute silk. Ariana Grande, returning to the Grammys last month after skipping 2019’s ceremony, pulled a similar tiered-gown power move in the vast pyramid of a Giambattista Valli gown in a sombre shade of slate grey.A lot of you – and I mean a lot of you – have worn this dress already, because it was the basic shape of the £40 Zara polka-dot dress that stole summer 2019. But where that dress had just two layers to its tiered skirt, the 2020 model usually has three or more, which is what gives it that skyscraper-esque, Chrysler-shaped ambition. (Zara has a graphic white mini version, for £29.99, which takes aim at your holiday wardrobe.)The lesson of the Zara dress, as the high street learned, is that – mindful not to overshop – we are increasingly drawn to what buyers call the three-day-a-week dress. This is a dress that works with flats and heels, for work and weekends, and lasts a day-to-night wear because it is comfy and doesn’t crease too much. It is a dress you can rely on, a dress you pack for every trip because it gets you out of wardrobe trouble. At its most sober and office-appropriate, this can be a shirt dress – Toast has an elegant collared dress in drapey viscose crepe, with softly gathered tiers and a scattered floral print, for £170. In its most fashionable form, the Chrysler dress cross-pollinates with Americana in its other vogueish form. The prairie dress is where Scandi chic meets pop culture’s yeehaw trend, in which the cowboy is making a postmodern comeback. (Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road wasn’t the longest-running No 1 in US chart history for nothing.)The prairie version of a Chrysler dress features some kind of Little House on the Prairie detailing – a Laura Ashley-esque fabric, a puffed sleeve, smocking – as well as the modish, Fab-lolly-tiered silhouette. Copenhagen-chic label Ganni and London-based Rixo, both of which have been well ahead of the Chrysler curve for several seasons, have western-inspired styles. Rixo’s Becky dress, £335, has a high frilled neckline and puff sleeves. Ganni’s seersucker check shirt-dress has a raised waistband, and four tiers to its skirt, for £225.The Chrysler shape is all about modern urban elegance, and the principle works just as well for clothes as for architecture.

Powell, a three-time Oscars and Baftas winner, said: “Then I thought: ‘It’s like a blank canvas. I could go armed with a pen, and get signatures. And maybe we could auction it.”And so it was that she dreamed up a way to help save Prospect Cottage, Jarman’s home on the windswept shore of Dungeness, Kent, which he had transformed from a Victorian fisherman’s hut and from where he created some of his best work.Powell strode forth among A-list celebrities at the London Critics’ Circle and Bafta awards to secure the signatures of more than 100 Hollywood stars and luminaries from the film and theatre industry.“I think I’ve done pretty well. I’ve got Robert de Niro, Al Pacino, Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson, Renée Zellweger, Laura Dern … I’ve got all the winners, so far,” she said. “But I need to get Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. There are a few big names missing.”So this weekend, she and the suit will head across the Atlantic to the Oscars. “I won’t wear it to the ceremony itself, but maybe to one of the parties. But I definitely want to get Martin Scorsese, who has agreed to do it,” she said.Some parts of the anatomy are less signature-friendly than others. Richard E Grant had to kneel down on the red carpet to add his name, while Gwendoline Christie found herself signing Powell’s inner leg.“I was quite choosy about who signed where,” said Powell, who has won Oscars for Shakespeare in Love, The Aviator and The Young Victoria.The result is a unique piece to be auctioned through the Art Fund charity, which is trying to raise £3.5m in 10 weeks to save Prospect Cottage and its stunning garden. Expressions of interest can be registered at development@artfund.org with details of the auction still to be announced.“It’s not just important as a piece of history, but also to preserve his legacy,” said Powell, who became close friends with Jarman after he hired her to work on Caravaggio. “It is so important Derek doesn’t get forgotten, and that he can continue to inspire young film-makers, artists and writers.”Jarman moved to the cottage in 1986, turning it into an artwork in its own right, filling the garden with sculptures made from flotsam and jetsam. After his death in 1994, it was cared for and maintained by his long-time companion Keith Collins, who died in 2018.The artist Tacita Dean and actor Tilda Swinton approached the Art Fund to come to the rescue. The £3.5m is needed to purchase, preserve and maintain the property as a place for artist residencies and public access. Creative Folkestone, an arts charity, will manage and maintain it. Jarman’s archive of documents and artefacts will also be available to the public at Tate Britain.Art Fund spokeswoman Rachel Mapplebeck said: “Derek Jarman’s Prospect Cottage is really a work of art in its entirety. The cottage is full of works of art by him and his friends. There are props from film sets. It’s surrounded by this incredible garden, which he created from the shingle beach.”Half of the £3.5m has been raised by private donors. The remainder is being crowdfunded through the Art Fund website, with many artists offering rewards in exchange for donations.Powell “hasn’t the faintest idea” how much her suit could raise. But she said: “It would be nice if it ended up in a museum, or somewhere where other people could see it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/264eadc1e29b55f13aad802aa8ce2099cf8faa1c/0_134_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9cfb655dc51cbd584f8156fdf40a34b","title":"why parasite misses mark commentary south korean society","story":"Bong Joon-ho plays on working-class stereotypes and fails to examine the system that created the film’s rich and poorLike the character Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) in Parasite and its director Bong Joon-ho, I too have entered the home of Seoul’s elite as an English tutor. I live in one of those old Seoul villas and memories of rushing my own white envelope to the bank to pay outstanding phone bills allows me a small window into what’s been called Bong’s “dystopia”. For many, the critically acclaimed film nominated for six Oscars signals the beginning of an overdue appreciation for Asian cinema but it is precisely the issue of representation that makes the undoubtedly beautiful film troubling. Despite being hailed as a social commentary on contemporary South Korean society, Bong misses the mark in his portrayal of the country’s economic crisis and plays on stereotypes of the working class in an attempt to critique capitalism.Alternatively, put aside those reservations and try to see the film as an allegory. It becomes a dark reenactment of the children’s book If You Give a Mouse a Cookie – more about greed than hunger. Ki-woo’s friend finds him a tutoring position at the upscale Park home – one that requires forging a fake diploma. With a wad of cash in his hands, Ki-woo fabricates yet another lie – introducing his sister as an art therapist named Jessica. By eliminating two other employees of the Park home, Ki-taek (their father, played by Song Kang-ho) becomes the chauffeur and Chungsook (their mother) assumes the role of housekeeper. Once the four are happily employed, Ki-woo not only pursues a physical relationship with underage student Dahye (Jung Ziso), but he imagines marrying her and the Kim parents fantasise about the Park house becoming their own. Stop the story here and the film being heralded as a critique of capitalism is more about the dangers of trusting the working class.The Kims have no plan, expect full pay for haphazardly folded pizza boxes, raid the Parks’ drinks cabinet and resort to bloody violence. All of Bong’s poor are similarly disorderly and directionless – drunkenly urinating on the street or waiting for free meals like prisoners. Bong argues the film is “a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains” but the vulgarity of the film’s working class in bold starkly contrasts the bourgeois elitism in the fine print. As the Parks “give nothing back and don’t really care about anyone other than themselves,” Mark Goldberg for Collider asks if the Parks are the real Parasites, but the Parks are generous in addition to being oblivious. Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) – mother of the Park family – offers higher rates for Ki-woo, compensates Ki-jung for attending a birthday party and pays Ki-taek overtime for working on a Sunday. Even if Dahye’s affections are superficially juvenile, both the Park children seem to genuinely like Ki-woo and “Jessica”.Without examining the system that has created the Kims and the Parks, the film’s message is reduced to this: commiserate with the working class – not because they are fully developed human beings with the same ethical dilemmas you have – but because they’re a hopeless lot. Bong himself glides between describing the film as an allegory and insisting he does not have an agenda. “I’m not making a documentary or propaganda here. It’s not about telling you how to change the world or how you should act because something is bad, but rather showing you the terrible, explosive weight of reality,” he told Vulture. As for my dystopia? After four sessions of tutoring, my student decided to “quit English”. When I told her mother I would have to return her upfront payment in instalments because I didn’t have the money, she thought I was lying."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aba1c2a2d7407c7a14276d9d754f0e85fefdbf/0_596_3160_1895/master/3160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9c15c2fcf1a629336647895ffea42bc","title":"barcelona meltdown lionel messi eric abidal","story":"• Sporting director had blamed players for Valverde sacking• Messi can leave club in summer thanks to contract clauseBarcelona were plunged into crisis when Lionel Messi publicly called out the sporting director Eric Abidal, challenging him to name names and accusing him of tarnishing the players’ reputation.The Argentinian furiously reacted to what he saw as Abidal’s attempt to lay the blame for the recent sacking of Ernesto Valverde with the players, and demanded the Frenchman take responsibility for his own decisions. His outburst is all the more significant because Messi has a clause in his contract which enables him to unilaterally walk away for free at the end of the season.Abidal claimed Barcelona’s players had not been happy with Valverde, who was sacked on 13 January, and that they had not been working hard enough under their former manager. The response from Messi was swift, public and unequivocal.It will also have lasting consequences, bringing internal ision into the open and laying bare the deep dissatisfaction many in the dressing room feel with the club’s board. An atmosphere of tension already surrounded the club, with criticism growing of the current president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, and the accusations of failure at an institutional as well as a footballing level.Abidal said he had started to look into replacing Valverde following the clásico on 18 December. He was eventually sacked after a public pursuit of potential replacements, starting with Xavi Hernández and Ronald Koeman and going through a handful of other candidates before, backed into a corner, finally settling on Quique Setién.Messi reacted by posting a picture of the interview on Instagram, with a red circle around one part which read: “The man in charge of the sporting directorate explains that ‘lots of players were not satisfied and nor did they work much’.” Underneath, he denied that the sacking was the players’ responsibility and accused Abidal of “dirtying” the squad.“Finally, I think that when players are talked about, names should be given because, if not, we are all being dirtied and it feeds comments that are made and are not true.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200203-59485-gnl.fw.20200203.ds.cityslip.mp3 In the summer, Messi had admitted that he wanted the club to sign Neymar, which they failed to do. “I don’t know if they did everything they could,” he said. Nor did they succeed in bringing in a striker during this transfer window.Abidal is a former teammate of Messi’s but his position is likely to be untenable. He was already under threat after the way the search for a manager was handled and following a transfer window in which Barcelona failed to sign a striker and instead sold two forwards, Carlos Pérez and Abel Ruiz, to raise funds and make way for a player who never came.That sense of crisis and collapse was deepened on Tuesday when it was confirmed that Ousmane Dembélé will be out for the rest of the season with a ruptured tendon in a thigh, while Luis Suárez is also not expected to be back to full fitness until the final weeks of the season at best. The spectre of losing Messi, so often the man holding Barcelona together in recent years, is a terrifying one for the club."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43c028f9c351462a924e76ddd1ace24c4facdb17/0_63_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb377f3d3f4303329465b3bce3f2bba","title":"premier league clubs betting sponsors var here to stay richard masters","story":"• Richard Masters says sport and gambling have long association• ‘We’re certainly not sniffy about it – it’s up to our clubs’The Premier League will resist moves to ban clubs from having their shirts sponsored by betting companies as part of the government’s promised review of gambling legislation, the league’s new chief executive, Richard Masters, has said.In a wide-ranging first media interview since the Premier League ended its long search to replace Richard Scudamore, and appointed him in December, Masters said the league would cooperate with the government review, but was “not sniffy or judgmental” about gambling.Masters also said that VAR, an object of some frustration this season to players, managers and supporters, was “here to stay” but the Premier League would seek improvements, including to the length of time it takes to check referees’ decisions, and potentially to the fine margins of the offside rule.“Sport and gambling have a long association,” Masters said, in response to campaigners’ concerns that the “gamblification” of football has long become excessive and is a cause of problem betting and addiction. The Premier League does not have a commercial gambling partner, he added, but acknowledged that all 20 clubs do – 10 have betting companies as their main shirt sponsor. “We’re certainly not sniffy about it it’s up to our clubs whether they want to have their own gambling relationships.”Discussing the government’s commitment to reviewing the 2005 Gambling Act, the legislation with which the then Labour government dramatically lifted previously stringent regulations on the industry, Masters said: “We’ll be welcome participants in that … I think this area does need stronger governance, particularly to protect the vulnerable. I don’t think the answer coming out at the end of it should be that football clubs shouldn’t have shirts sponsored by gambling companies, but … we will certainly cooperate with the review.”Challenged about whether this relaxed approach to clubs promoting gambling was consistent with the Premier League’s commitment to its community programmes, which carry out social inclusion and education projects with deprived and vulnerable people, Masters responded: “We’re not sniffy or judgmental about gambling at all.”Responding to controversies about VAR, Masters said the Premier League had carried out polling of fans which found a majority support its impact on more accurate decision-making, but widespread frustration was also expressed with the time checks can take and the tiny margins which determine offsides. The details of the poll will be shared with the clubs at their meeting on Thursday, and the league is considering whether to ask football’s international law-making body, Ifab, if the offside rule could be changed.“I think it’s here to stay,” Masters said of VAR, “and certainly it’s going to be with us next season. We will look at the development next season to iron out some of the issues we have had.”Referring to reports a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund is discussing buying Newcastle United, having first considered Manchester United, Masters said any new owner would be subject to “due diligence” and background checks.The league’s “fit and proper persons” test for owners and directors bars people who have criminal convictions, including those who have committed acts in other countries which would be considered crimes in England. Asked whether there would be an investigation into the key people involved in a Saudi fund if it did take over a club, Masters said: “We do an enormous amount of due diligence, we do so it’s not just that we receive the forms … and take them at face value. There are background checks, and that’s the same for everybody.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09267d4655c65048bbbdc9f0748f8ae31a9fc227/1106_28_1299_779/master/1299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fa54f243aaab38280f00018e61d1a2d","title":"christian eriksen felt like the black sheep at tottenham inter","story":"Christian Eriksen says his decision to run down his contract made him a “black sheep” at Tottenham.The 27-year-old midfielder joined Internazionale last week for £17m.

Is he unique in this respect?” pondered Nigel Stubbs in February 2006, an archive question we dug up again last week. With the Oscars this weekend, what better time to revisit it?Our very own Stuart Goodwin gets the ball rolling with Wilson Palacios and Shane Duffy, along with former Birmingham City skipper Ray Martin. He even has a referee in the shape of Michael Oliver!The 1972 rat-based horror Ben, according to Peter McIntyre, sets up some potentials: Sweat (Inter Miami) among them. From this we can get Ben Foster (Watford) and Ben Godfrey (Norwich City). Tim Postins kicks things along. “Jack Arthur (goalkeeper at Exeter City) is a mix of an absolutely awful 1996 Francis Ford Coppola comedy starring Robin Williams and a slightly less awful 1981 Dudley Moore comedy that won two Oscars,” he writes. “Everton striker Chloe Kelly is a mash-up of the 2009 movie starring Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried and the slightly obscure 1981 drama Kelly. Patrick Brothers (Leiston) and Jade North (Brisbane Roar) also qualify, but just to be flash, here’s a three-fer. If you take 2015 indie sci-fi thriller Trent, Colin Farrell’s ridiculous ‘epic’ Alexander and the 1973 Roddy MacDowell-starring black comedy Arnold … well, I’m sure you can work it out.”And Robin Clarke goes off on a tangent. “The question reminded me of another one about seeing things in the classified results,” he begins. “On Wednesday 24 February 2016 Derby County beat Blackburn Rovers 1-0. The scorer was Butterfield 8.”“Lincoln City are currently fielding Max Melbourne and Conor Coventry – their city namesakes being 17,000km apart. Can any other side beat this?” asks Andrew Newton.17,041km: “Lyon have a couple of good candidates,” reckons Russell Yong. “Memphis (Depay), Tennessee, is 15,622km from (Jeff Reine-) Adelaide. However, the only combination that beats Melbourne-Coventry was created when they signed Bruno Guimarães last week Guimaraes, Portugal, is 17,041km from Adelaide, Australia.” Interestingly, Lyon’s signing deprives Brazil’s Club Athletico Paranaense of a 19,758km pairing, of Guimarães alongside Wellington. Russell has more, though. “It’s been hard to fit the criterion of actual cities. Yeovil’s (Courtney) Duffus is 18,162km from (Stuart) Nelson, New Zealand, but Duffus is a village (outside Elgin, Scotland) rather than a city. Similarly, Athletico Paranaense’s Wellington – again – is 18,369km from Lucas Halter, a hamlet of Visbek, Germany. We could have had Palmeiras’s Nino (El Nino being a suburb of Murcia, Spain) 19,521km from Wellington (Silva), but alas, the latter was loaned to Internacional earlier this season.”18,437km: Graeme Atkinson pipes up with “(Sammy) Nelson and (Alan) Sunderland (teammates in the 70s and 80s at Arsenal)”.Alas, we’re not taking Dwayne Mars playing alongside Louis Moss in a 2011 World Cup qualifier for Barbados (Liam McGuigan) or 1999-2000 Ipswich teammates Mark Venus, Jamie Clapham, Matt Holland and Mick Stockwell (Graeme again).“Once, on a disastrous tour to France with my school team, I played so terribly at right-back that I was substituted, in spite of the fact that our only sub was the reserve goalkeeper,” recalls Benjie Goodhart. “Has any outfield player ever played so badly they’ve been similarly embarrassed?”Not quite, but there’s definitely some embarrassment in this old favourite. “Nicky Weaver once replaced former USA international midfielder Claudio Reyna for Manchester City in the Premier League,” recalls John Morgan. “City were playing Middlesbrough and needed a win to clinch a Uefa Cup place on the last day of the 2004-05 season. Manager Stuart Pearce decided David James would be an effective target man, and brought Weaver on in place of Reyna, moving James up front in an outfield shirt bearing the No 1. James didn’t score, but contrived to cause enough panic that City won an injury-time penalty for a Franck Queudrue handball … only for Robbie Fowler to miss and blow City’s chance. The only person feeling worse in the entire ground must have been Jon Macken – a centre forward, one-time record City signing and unused sub watching the farce from the dugout.”“With the appointment of Mikel Arteta following the sacking of Unai Emery, Arsenal have the distinction of employing two successive Basque managers,” notes Oliver Farry. “Has this ever happened outside Spain before? Is it even common in Spain outside the Basque Country?”“Cypriot club AEK Larnaca replaced Imanol Idiakez with Athletic Club legend, Andoni Iraola,” tweets GIoryHornet. “They then rehired Idiakez after sacking Iraola.”“Are there any stories of journalists making rash promises to perform unlikely feats if given football results were to occur?” wondered Justin Horton in 2014.Henry Winter, Bernie Slaven, Doria Tillier et al were not the only ones to make some foolish promises in the heat of the moment. “BBC WM presenter Paul Franks said he’d run around Molineux if Stale Solbakken got the job,” reported Paul Waterfield. “He did it in the mankiest pair of underpants imaginable.” And a mankini.“Has a player ever picked up an injury during a medical?” asks David McCarville.“Mark Walters’ middle name is Everton, despite playing umpteen times for Liverpool,” explains Alex Gowing. “Does any other footballer have a name (first, middle or surname) which was a direct rival of a club they played for?”“Nigel Pearson looks to have revived Watford,” begins Mike Tomkins. “I discovered he was the boss when Jimmy Glass saved Carlisle in 1999 nine years later and he helped save Southampton from relegation to League One at the expense of future employers Leicester. Of course he went on to famously save the Foxes the season before they won the Premier League. And he was the assistant manager when West Brom beat the drop in 2005.

But their efforts have often been frustrated, mostly for a more fundamental reason than the technological barrier in place since August: they believe the aid community sent to help them is not listening.“The Rohingya community are not weak, but the situation makes us weak,” says Mohammad Arfaat, an activist who was part of a Rohingya team that made a short film about how violence had forced them from Myanmar in 2017.He has been calling for more help for Rohingya to launch their own initiatives, for everything from education to arts, but complains there has been no support. “The Rohingya youth are very talented … but nobody sits, nobody talks with them, so their voices have stopped,” says Arfaat.These concerns have risen since August, when Bangladesh responded to a failed attempt to repatriate the Rohingya – for which not a single refugee volunteered – by imposing tighter restrictions on their movement and communication.Arfaat says that, despite the crackdown, UN agencies and international aid groups have not been present.Lack of education has been a particularly pressing concern among Rohingya activists, who have campaigned for years against a government ban on all but the most basic level of schooling, warning of a “lost generation”.They won a victory last month when Bangladesh announced a pilot programme to teach children between 11 and 13 the Myanmar curriculum. Rohingya teachers and activists had little knowledge of how the plan would work, however.The restrictions have been in place since the existing camps were established in 1991, when the same fears about future generations prompted Rohingya who had been educated in Myanmar to set up their own independent learning centres in secret, funded by small monthly contributions from parents.Similar models have become more prevalent since 2017, when the Kutupalong refugee camp became the world’s largest as it absorbed the hundreds of thousands of people who fled a Myanmar military operation described by the UN as having “genocidal intent”.Activist Khin Maung says that despite three decades of Rohingya experience in the refugee camps, their expertise is not tapped by humanitarian workers.He complains that organisations implementing education projects often employ underqualified tutors who teach only basic phrases and nursery rhymes, failing to utilise the talents of refugees.A 2019 study by the Peace Research Institute Oslo said that, despite the barriers imposed on the humanitarian community by the government’s education ban, more could have been done to map out the work carried out by Rohingya themselves.“The humanitarian sector often falls short on centring community voices in this way, which I think is due in part to policy restrictions, limited resources and a lack of flexibility,” says the report’s co-author Jessica Olney.“It’s also due to quick staff turnaround, as many humanitarian staff are new to the Rohingya community and aren’t encouraged or permitted by their agencies to spend time in the camps just talking to people and listening to gain a deep understanding of the context and people’s needs.”The relationship between the Rohingya and the humanitarian community has been strained by a recent government order to stop paying refugee volunteers in cash, which the authorities claim is used to buy false documents. The government has encouraged the hiring of Bangladeshis instead.Refugees claim they have been removed from volunteer roles, which typically pay a daily stipend of less than £3, which forces them to rely solely on the aid supply of oil, lentils and rice.NGOs operating in the area claim “miscommunication” was a reason some Rohingya had been dismissed.“There is a major communication breakdown between some international humanitarian organisations and the Rohingya refugee volunteers about why they are being dismissed,” says John Quinley, human rights specialist for the advocacy group Fortify Rights, which has documented the dismissals.There was a similar outcry by refugees when the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, signed an agreement with Myanmar on repatriating the Rohingya in 2018. Refugees said they were not consulted on that deal, or about a system for biometric registration.A spokesperson for the UNHCR says the agency used several methods to share information with refugees and engage community leaders, including face-to-face meetings, drama performances and podcasts.The spokesperson adds: “The Rohingya refugee population in Cox’s Bazar is more than 850,000 people. This alone presents a challenge in terms of ensuring that all voices are heard. Furthermore, to communicate effectively with a very large population requires the utilisation of technology. Currently, this presents challenges in Cox’s Bazar due to restrictions on mobile connectivity.“UNHCR works to ensure that refugees are consulted on key issues and are involved in decision-making processes including through regular protection monitoring and profiling, as well as community outreach. Refugees should be consulted on all issues related to their daily lives and not only significant political developments.”Maung says the role played by refugees in the humanitarian response over the past two years, from volunteering as translators to other key roles, has been underestimated.“They ignore us but without Rohingya involvement they can’t do anything in the camps, they can’t even understand us properly. They don’t know our language,” he says. “We are the nuts and bolts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c29485a681aece9e0a950b3b283747638d0a8309/0_702_6184_3711/master/6184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9bfd6d19609445c9ea26fcfdd9c6beb","title":"tell us about the pressures men are under to have children","story":"We would like to hear from men who are feeling under pressure to have children by a certain ageSome men feel pressure to have children by a certain age.

It is the first time this pattern has been shown outside primates.“We can probably find many other species that conform to these laws because this is probably a general principle, rather than something related to human language specifically,” said Dr Livio Favaro, a co-author of the research now at the University of Turin.Prof Stuart Semple of the University of Roehampton, who was not involved in the work but has previously conducted similar research in non-human primates, said the new study adds weight to the idea that animals tend to convey information in the most efficient way. Such an approach is known as “compression” and is also seen in systems such as morse code where the most commonly used letters have the simplest and shortest sounds – either a dot or a dash.“If you have compression in the communication system it is more efficient,” said Semple. “So it is the sort of thing that evolution will have acted on because animals that communicate efficiently are expending less energy.”Writing in the journal Biology Letters, Favaro and colleagues describe how they analysed 590 vocalisations recorded from 28 adult African penguins – also known as jackass penguins because of their distinctive sound – that live in Italian zoos.These vocalisations were so-called “ecstatic display songs” – calls, typically uttered by males, that communicate an inidual’s identity, tell rivals that territory is taken, and help the birds bag a mate.These songs are made up of sequences of three distinctive types of sound – or syllables. The team say the findings suggests the penguins’ songs follow two laws seen across a wide range of human languages as well as some, but not all, non-human primates – Zipf’s law of brevity and the Menzerath-Altmann law.The former states that the more often a sound is used the shorter it is – in English, for example, the most common words include “the”, “to” and “of” – while the latter says that the longer a unit of language the shorter the components within it: for example cumbersome words tend to contain shorter syllables than simple ones. “One-syllable words can be very long, like ‘strength’, but many-syllable words tend to have short syllables, like ‘pa-ra-me-ter-ise’,” said Prof Chris Kello, an expert in modelling language patterns at the University of California, Merced who was not involved in the latest research.While the new study has limitations – including that it only looked at one form of vocalisation among the penguins – Favaro said the study shows the linguistic laws are not about language per se, as they are not linked to semantics or syntax, but are rooted more in a fundamental principle of sharing information efficiently. What’s more, he added, the research reveals the interplay of different evolutionary pressures, such as the need to convey the size of the animal and its identity, all while communicating efficiently.Kello welcomed the study. “Linguistic laws, like Zipf’s law of brevity and the Menzerath-Altmann law, were originally discovered in text,” he said, noting that meant it was initially thought that they arose from the symbolic nature of human language.“This new study provides more evidence that the laws are physical and not symbolic, because even penguins show them. Instead, the laws seem to reflect something deeper and more general about communication and information.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ac98ffb75040a40642cf264abe8662b9481f5b1/580_27_2651_1591/master/2651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a048a45ec1ec47f0648dd4efba5f0d5","title":"women golfers benefit most prize money mixed teams world cup","story":"Female golfers could be the biggest beneficiaries from an ambitious scheme to revolutionise the sport’s World Cup, with plans afoot to boost prize money and introduce mixed gender teams. Detailed talks about the World Cup, a biennial event which does not resonate deeply within the sport, have been ongoing for a number of months. The plan would see the competition’s purse boosted from $7m to upwards of $10m, with female golfers entering the fold seen as commercially beneficial.A bigger prize fund would, of course, be welcomed by male participants, but it would make a more significant impact on the female game as players look to close the pay gap between themselves and members of the PGA Tour in particular.The US-based LPGA Tour announced what was essentially a takeover of the Ladies European Tour in late 2019. Improvements to the women’s schedule in Europe that followed were widely heralded.Origin Sports Group, where the multi-millionaire Sir Keith Mills is a director, has been integral to the World Cup project. Australia was the recent host of the November event, but even its place in the golfing calendar may be subject to change, with venues in Europe and the Middle East expressing interest in the World Cup under a fresh guise.Nothing is expected to be in place by the time the World Cup tees off later this year – with Thomas Pieters and Thomas Detry to defend the trophy on behalf of Belgium – but alterations for 2022 are entirely plausible.Origin declined to comment on its involvement when contacted by the , beyond confirming: “The PGA Tour is working on a variety of options to potentially relaunch the World Cup of Golf and we’ve been in touch with them on several concepts.” A spokesman for the PGA Tour would not reference the World Cup directly but said: “We’ve looked at new ways to promote the game of golf through new formats and certainly an event that would include PGA Tour and LPGA players is something that we will continue to explore.”In 2016, the PGA and LPGA Tours announced a strategic alliance that pointed heavily towards the introduction of joint events. This June, the European Tour and Ladies European Tour will join up to stage a mixed tournament in Sweden. This competition, hosted by major champions Annika Sorenstam and Henrik Stenson, will see professional men and women going head-to-head on the same course for a single prize and trophy.Yet a revolution at the World Cup, which unlike many other sports doesn’t routinely feature as a key ambition of players, would be the most significant competitive advancement yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d41c8dbfd5926aacc545643820b72d6e4df4fdf0/765_978_8056_4834/master/8056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb28dfbd1078e984cd5ca583b695f32","title":"black waters phoenix dance theatre","story":"Phoenix Dance Theatre’s show looks back to the Zong slave ship massacre and the Kālā Pānī prison torture. Three choreographers explain how they created it togetherHow many people does it take to make a piece of dance? Dozens could be involved in staging a whole production, but usually there is one choreographer’s name at the top of the bill. It’s rare to walk into a studio, such as this large, bright space in Leeds, and see three people at the helm, all calling the shots.This is the home of Phoenix Dance Theatre, whose latest work, Black Waters, is being co-created by Phoenix’s artistic director, Sharon Watson, alongside Shambik Ghose and Mitul Sengupta, who are both from the Kolkata-based company Rhythmosaic.How does that even work, I ask them, sitting in Watson’s office between rehearsals. “It’s working!” says Watson. “Absolutely, it’s working!” says Ghose and the trio laugh as if they’re surprised that’s the answer. But how do they agree on what to do? “It’s a pleasurable conflict,” adds Ghose, with a big, infectious smile.Working with Ghose and Sengupta fits with Watson’s vision for Phoenix, a company founded by black British dancers in the 1980s, to bring a broader range of voices to the stage. For Black Waters, Watson and her collaborators focused on “two narratives that really hit home”, both shameful episodes from British colonial history that resonated with the three choreographers. First, from 1781, the massacre aboard the Zong slave ship, when around 130 slaves were thrown overboard in order to claim insurance on their lives. Then the events at the Kālā Pānī prison (Hindi for black waters) in India’s Andaman Islands, where Indian independence activists were tortured in the early 20th century.The trio felt that both episodes were not well enough known. “They’re things that have affected all of us in terms of our cultural histories,” says Watson. “But it feels very relevant today that we’re still having these challenges around the British colonial conversation, the lack of visibility, being written out of history.”Rather than try to tell complex stories in full, the choreographers focus on common themes: forced transportation, entrapment, emancipation. They don’t mind if viewers don’t know exactly what’s happening in fact, Watson wants you to be puzzled, but to get so involved in the images and emotional journeys of the dancers, that you go home and read up on the facts.Using multiple choreographers recognises that there’s no single viewpoint on history, but the three of them still have to create something coherent that works on stage. Their dance backgrounds are completely different, Watson from contemporary, Sengupta from Indian kathak, Ghose from jazz, ballet and modern. They’re not making a cut-and-paste of styles, but “looking for an image which is workable for all of us,” says Sengupta, and watching the dancers you can see some of the sharp diagonal lines and flowering fingers of kathak mixed with earthy contemporary undulations.Four weeks into a six-week creation process, “the flow is on” says Ghose. “Now we can read each other very well.” But there are still disagreements. “Shambik’s line is: ‘You can think about it,’” says Watson, “But sometimes I say, you know what, I’m not even going to think about it!”As well as different dance techniques there are different working dynamics to manage. “Even the tone in the studio,” says Watson. “They are both talking at each other, conversations overlapping, the volume of the discussion growing.”“Sharon taught us one thing the first week, which was keeping quiet,” laughs Ghose. “I never keep quiet, never in my life!” The reason for keeping quiet is not only because there are two other choreographers to listen to, but the dancers are also involved in the creation – and this, too, is a new approach for Ghose and Sengupta.“I came from a very orthodox tradition where dancers were never allowed to say anything,” says Sengupta. “Here it’s the opposite.” Watching the rehearsal, at first Sengupta and Ghose hardly intervene as the dancers take the lead in working out their entrance. The most confident put their ideas forward first, then quieter dancers speak up. “I feel it needs to be smaller.” “How about you fall and I catch?” “If this is rubbish, you tell me,” says one before offering up an idea. “Ah, yes!” claps another in response. “What vibe are we feeling?” she asks before they attempt a try-out. “Make people cry,” comes the suggestion from behind.Only then do Ghose and Sengupta step in, choosing, refining and shaping steps. It takes an hour to create a few minutes of choreography, but each moment is formed through rigorous inquisition, attending to tiny subtleties of tone, placement and attack.All three choreographers say this experience has made them think in new ways. “I can’t keep growing as an artist if I’m not fed by other creative voices,” says Watson, although she admits it’s hard to let go of needing to be the one with all the answers. Ghose and Sengupta have worked collaboratively before, but never as fruitfully as this. “Every moment something is happening,” says Ghose. “We have so many ideas we can’t contain them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3288efa5fdd20916813125d33f4e547555be8d2d/0_252_7167_4300/master/7167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fddac75784608a28d248420789fb329","title":"jessica hynes interview far away","story":"Taking a break from goofy sitcoms, the actor is sounding the climate-crisis alarm in Caryl Churchill’s Far Away. She talks about finding hope in a violent dystopia‘You’re in a world in which you are effectively at war with nature,” says Jessica Hynes, slurping noodles on her lunch break, “and nature is at war with itself.” Hynes is in rehearsals for the Donmar’s revival of Caryl Churchill’s dystopian Far Away, in which love is strangled at every turn by violence, oceans take sides in humanity’s battles and children’s curiosity is crushed when they ask why older generations aren’t rushing to put out the fires they’ve made. “It’s exquisite,” Hynes says of the prophetic text, first staged in 2000 at the Royal Court. “She’s a legend for good reason.”Hynes made her name starring in the cult TV comedy Spaced, which she co-wrote with Nick Frost and Simon Pegg. She won a Bafta in 2015 for the BBC parody W1A and again in 2019 for the disability-focused drama There She Goes most recently she played a radiation-riddled activist in Russell T Davies’ devastating Years and Years. Far Away, which she describes as “a kind of poem”, is her first Churchill play.Its landscape is a putrid one. The short three-act structure follows Joan and Todd who work at a hat factory, creating extravagant artefacts under the watchful eye of a fearsome dictatorial government. Violence seeps into the everyday as secrets and lies amass, and by the end of the play, every sentient being on Earth is engaged in conflict. “It’s artful and stylistic in some ways,” says Hynes of Churchill’s writing, “but also incredibly natural and almost perfunctory, even though what is really going on is shocking.”Hynes plays Joan’s morally woozy aunt, Harper, who disguises human screams as owl’s shrieks and piles up lies to hide the bloodstains. “Everyone thinks they’re the good guy,” Hynes says of the character’s morality. “Everyone believes that what they’re doing is for the right reasons.” In a 2016 interview, Hynes said the trait she most deplored in others was dishonesty in Harper, she has a character whose natural state is to lie. “It’s more complicated than honesty or dishonesty,” she says. “I’m trying to find her humanity, even when it feels like inhumanity.”Though never ascribed to a particular struggle, Churchill wrote the play in 200, at the time of the Serbian conflict. “But its brilliance is in the fact that you could take it anywhere,” Hynes says. “It could be 2,000 years in the future or 1,000 years in the past.”This production draws out the focus on the environment, with the war on nature bought to the fore. Plants and animals are weaponised and ided the ants side with the Moroccans and the weather joins the fight of the Japanese. It is both a rage against inaction and a shrug against the inevitability of violence stemming from an uncaring, eco-damaging capitalist system. “Normal people are never really the perpetrators,” Hynes figures. “They are the victims of circumstance, of the wider chaos of war.”Hynes is best known for her comedy, so it feels strange to sit with her and talk earnestly about destruction. Though there is absurdity in Far Away, both in the language (“The cats have come in on the side of the French”) and the action (in the infamous parade scene), the show is not played for laughs. “We’re trying to honour the script completely,” she says, “and do something that feels as faithful and truthful and open as we can make it.”Harper begins the play by talking about how beautiful the owls are outside her windows, but fast-forward a few years and she sees violence in every wing of a bird or blade of grass. As audience members, we skip the distance between these viewpoints. “We talked about what might have happened in that middle act,” Hynes explains, “to make that slowly encroaching ravaged landscape, with more grief, more loss, more violence, more struggle.” In the first scene, director Lyndsey Turner has Harper weaving a quilt of a natural landscape, building up an image of what is beginning to break down around them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faec54546ec25128756573a3def7fa0f27d69bfa/0_75_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=208dba03097acaf879dcd27ba3e55d12","title":"twitter label remove manipulated media","story":"Company, along with Google and Facebook, is under pressure to prevent interference in the 2020 US electionsTwitter will begin to label and in some cases remove doctored or manipulated photos, audio and videos that are designed to mislead people.The company said on Tuesday that the new rules prohibit sharing synthetic or manipulated material that’s likely to cause harm. Material that is manipulated but isn’t necessarily harmful may get a warning label.Under the new guidelines, the slowed-down video of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in which she appeared to slur her words could get the label if someone tweets it out after the rules go into effect 5 March. If it was proven that it also causes harm, Twitter could also remove it.But deciding what might cause harm could be difficult to define, and some material will probably fall into a gray area.“This will be a challenge and we will make errors along the way – we appreciate the patience,“ Twitter said in a blogpost. “However, we’re committed to doing this right.”Twitter said it considers threats to the safety of a person or a group serious harm, along with risk of mass violence or widespread civil unrest. But harm could also mean threats to people’s privacy or ability to freely express themselves, Twitter said. This could include stalking, voter suppression and intimidation epithets and “material that aims to silence someone”.Google, Facebook, Twitter and other technology services are under intense pressure to prevent interference in the 2020 US elections after they were manipulated in four years ago by Russia-connected actors.On Monday, Google’s YouTube clarified its policy around political manipulation, reiterating that it bans election-related “deepfake” videos. Facebook has also been ramping up its election security efforts.As with many of Twitter’s policies, including those against hate speech or abuse, for instance, success will be measured in how well the company enforces it. Critics say even with rules in place, enforcement can be uneven and slow. This is likely to be especially true for misinformation, which can spread quickly on social media even with safeguards in place. Facebook, for instance, has been using third-party factcheckers to debunk false stories on its site for three years. While the efforts are paying off, the battle against misinformation is far from over.Twitter said it was committed to seeking input from its users on such rules. Twitter said it posted a survey in six languages and received 6,500 responses from around the world. According to the company, the majority of respondents said misleading tweets should be labeled, though not everyone agreed on whether they should be removed or left up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b44615c122e821e84ede767a88d2ed018cfd0c9/0_164_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c3ecfea4c5018cebd8c2a0f8644155b","title":"the rise of facial recognition technology podcast","story":"Facial recognition technology is getting more sophisticated each year and is now being used commercially as identification instead of passwords as well as being adopted by the politan police in London.

An average of a recent string of polls and results of a Des Moines RegisterCNN Iowa poll that were pulled because of respondent concerns showed Sanders with a slight edge over Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, with Joe Biden fading off.A rousing speech from Storm Lake city resident Linda Torres, a 24-year-old precinct captain, about how Sanders’ healthcare plan would have saved her father’s life helped seal the crowd’s preference for Sanders. Torres’ sister, Teresa, told the : “Bernie’s fighting for us for all the right reasons.”The end count was 93-0 for Sanders. Twelve other people at the precinct, most of them supporting Buttigieg, decided they’d leave rather than throw their support behind the progressive firebrand.Everything had been easy to run. Everything had worked.Until Marroquin turned to the party-administered app to report his results at around 8.50pm.That’s when events in at the precinct site – echoing similar scenes at hundreds of other caucus sites across the state – began to go very wrong. The app for transmitting results was not working in many places. A telephone hotline back-up system quickly became jammed. The TV cable news shows, eagerly awaiting results, rapidly turned to covering the ever-lengthening delay.“The website wasn’t working, so we had to go to this hotline, where we had to wait, like, an hour to get anybody on the other line,” Marroquin said over the phone at about midnight on Tuesday morning. “And when we did, we got people on the other side who were breaking down crying. The whole thing took forever.”Marroquin said he finally uploaded the results at around midnight.Marroquin, Torres and the entirety of the local Sanders operation camped out until the wee hours of Tuesday morning in anticipation of the Democratic party releasing something. As of 10am local time, the state map was still blank, the party still maintaining results would be released at “some time” on Tuesday.By then all the major candidates in Iowa had already given farewell speeches and moved on to the next state in the race: New Hampshire. But still no results had been released as officials scrambled to recount results verify them, as national and international headlines focused on the unfolding chaos.A  survey of caucus-goers and observers around Iowa showed experiences similar to that of Marroquin. Norbert Sarsfield, a Sanders precinct captain in Iowa City, said a mishandling of the first alignment delayed reporting in one of Iowa’s largest precincts the reporting issue only compounded the issue, he said.“Rage drinking,” he said of his experience at his Iowa City precinct.The informal survey showed Sanders, Buttigieg and Warren making strong showings, and Amy Klobuchar was exceeding expectations. JD Scholten, a Sioux City Democrat running for Iowa’s fourth district, said results across western Iowa showed varied support for Klobuchar and Buttigieg. Sarsfield said Warren and Sanders led the way.Still, without actual results, no one really knows.The Iowa caucuses are never about the final delegate count in total, its 41 delegates comprise around a single percentage point of the total delegate total. The caucuses are more of a stress test for the campaigns, explained Brad Best, a Buena Vista University political science professor and a longtime observer of the caucuses.A win for Sanders or a better-than-expected turnout for Buttigieg or Warren could have spun new narratives of strength heading into the New Hampshire primaries and Super Tuesday. That’s why every four years Iowa is such a hard-fought battleground.That’s all for naught now.Best said the caucuses and Iowa’s first-in-the-nation status are probably in jeopardy after Monday night’s fiasco.“The Iowa caucuses generate narratives, both legitimate and not,” Best said in a recent interview. “The campaigns seize on them to demonstrate new strength heading into subsequent primaries, and the fact they can’t this time, is already posing headaches.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b288c8fd87eef0dc49e842a881566f62ebbf8a5e/0_264_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ef261f7cd3d928b45e96376f01b26c1","title":"iowa results winner pete buttigieg leading","story":"Iowa Democratic party announces partial results with former South Bend mayor trailed closely by Bernie SandersPete Buttigieg, the previously little-known former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, held a narrow lead in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday night, according to a partial release of a majority of the results by the state Democratic party a day after an embarrassing organizational breakdown that marred the biggest night of the election year so far.However, clouded by doubts and uncertainty, the result could change as additional precincts report.“We know this data is accurate and we also have a paper trail,” Troy Price, chair of the Iowa Democratic party, said at a press conference in Des Moines. “We have been working day and night to make sure these results are accurate.”He declined to answer questions about when the state party would release the remainder of the results.The early tally reflects Buttigieg’s remarkable rise from little-known mayor of a midsize midwestern city to a top-tier presidential candidate. Immediately after the initial numbers were released, the 38-year-old gay candidate declared it an “astonishing victory” for a campaign that has already defied long odds.“A campaign that started a year ago with four staff members, no name recognition, no money – just a big idea – a campaign that some said should have no business even making this attempt, has taken its place at the front of this race to replace the president with a better vision,” Buttigieg said at a campaign event in Laconia, New Hampshire.In a rare display of emotion, Buttigieg said the result “validates for a kid, somewhere in a community, wondering if he belongs, where she belongs, or they belong in their own family, that if you believe in yourself and your country, there’s a lot backing up that belief”.The Sanders campaign was quick to point to the raw vote count as evidence of the senator’s ability to excite Democratic voters.Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser for Sanders’ campaign, said in a statement: “So far it’s clear that in the first and second round more people voted for Bernie than any other candidate in the field.”It was a blow for Biden, however, who has led the field in national polling since he entered the race and campaigned on his perceived electability. Biden’s campaign objected to the party’s decision to release the partial results.By all accounts, Iowa Democrats were determined to support a candidate who they believe could defeat Donald Trump in the election in November. The caucuses offered a first glimpse of who voters believe is best suited to do that.In Iowa on Monday night, a mobile app meant to help steer organizers through the complicated caucus process and help them report results turned out to be defective.As the hours dragged on without an announced result, leading contenders in the crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates claimed success while minor candidates saw no reason to drop out.“The reporting of the results and circumstances surrounding the 2020 Iowa Democratic party caucuses were unacceptable,” said Price. “As the chair of the party, I apologize deeply for this.”But Price insisted the data was “accurate” and “secure” and vowed a “thorough, transparent and independent examination” would follow.Part of the issue on Monday night was a decision by the state party to release four sets of data from the caucuses in response to complaints over transparency by the Sanders campaign in 2016, when Hillary Clinton defeated him in the state delegate count by a quarter of a percentage point.Meanwhile, Democratic officials in Nevada sought to mitigate concerns ahead of the states caucuses on 22 February, announcing that the party would not use the same app or vendor.But the confusion and chaos engulfing the process may yet overshadow the results as attention turns to New Hampshire, which holds the next nominating contest on 11 February.On Monday night after Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Biden sought to turn the confusion to their advantage, delivering bold speeches that touted their strong performances in Iowa without a clear sense of who was in pole position.The president wasted little time in crowing over his opponents’ predicament, tweeting on Tuesday morning: “The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country … the only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is ‘Trump’.”Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, did not compete in Iowa but on Tuesday announced that he would double the fortune he’s already spending on national television advertising and expand his sprawling staff.Bypassing the early-voting states, Bloomberg is pursuing a highly unconventional approach to the party’s nomination that involves massive ad spending and a focus on the delegate-rich states that hold contests in March.“Iowa is supposed to be the place lots of candidates go to die,” the Democratic strategist Jim Messina, campaign manager for Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, told the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d496af240c6e1c1707d7b3f1594f695d42b29017/0_0_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c7ba6b6694fcb49ca5b033d2521ffab","title":"iowa election tech issues florida","story":"From Iowa to Florida, election day meltdowns of inadequately tested or monitored machinery are as American as apple pieThe year was 2002, and the race was a hotly contested Florida gubernatorial election in which Janet Reno, the former US attorney general, was vying for the Democratic party nomination against a prominent lawyer from Tampa. A politically connected company called Electronic Systems \u0026amp Software (ES\u0026ampS) was rolling out new touchscreen technology to replace the punch card machines that were widely blamed for the meltdown in the presidential election two years earlier between George W Bush and Al Gore.ES\u0026ampS, though, was very far from ready for prime time.At the time, Lida Rodriguez-Taseff of the Miami-Dade Electoral Reform Coalition raged that the voters were being treated as guinea pigs for a system that was no better than a prototype. Eighteen years later, she can only look back and marvel at how little has changed.“It is striking that these technology issues are back, and back with a vengeance,” she told the . “The technology we use on a daily basis may be incredibly advanced and sophisticated … but voting has been left to bottom-feeding companies that have not adhered to the highest standards and have often gotten to where they are because of political connections, not the quality of their product.”Rodriguez-Taseff, a commercial lawyer still deeply involved in elections work, was particularly stunned to learn that even after the new app introduced to report results in Iowa failed, the backup phone lines went down.“The fact that these counties are not even prepared with basic technology from the 1960s to report results in a timely basis using a backup hard line is shocking,” she said. “I can’t believe it’s even an issue. Every election I work, the first thing we do is test our land lines.”While it is far from clear what exactly caused the breakdown in Iowa, early reporting suggests that the new app, developed by a technology firm with close ties to the Democratic party named Shadow, was not tested adequately ahead of time.It’s a story that sounds maddeningly familiar to veterans of America’s never-ending wars over voting rules, ballot access and voting technology. It’s hard to look back, in fact, without concluding that election day meltdowns of inadequately tested or inadequately monitored machinery are as American as apple pie.When punch cards were the hot new thing, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, they failed repeatedly. In one primary election in Los Angeles in 1970, ballot cards jammed, candidates’ names were found to be misaligned or missing and computer malfunctions prevented any vote count at all in more than 500 precincts.When a competitor to ES\u0026ampS introduced touchscreens in Riverside county, California, in the early 2000s, it led to at least two instances – one a school board race and the other a county supervisor contest – where the count had to be halted on election night and the result mysteriously changed once the machines were fired up again.Yet another competitor whose name became briefly synonymous with election machine dysfunction – Diebold Election Systems – mangled its rollout in Georgia in 2002 so badly that questions still linger about the reliability of the results in closely fought general election races for the Senate and for the governorship. The company then wreaked havoc in California presidential primary season two years later, in part because of battery drainage problems that knocked machines out of service even before the polls opened. “We did not realize,” the company’s chief executive later told a state oversight panel, “that when we have an off button on this machine, that it does not turn the system off.”More recently, the problems inherent in poorly designed voting machines have been compounded by their age. Election officials in Georgia have been entirely unable to explain why, in 2018, tens of thousands of voters who cast a ballot for governor and for every other statewide race mysteriously omitted to mark a choice for lieutenant governor. In one precinct, the votes collected on some machines showed the Democrats winning every statewide race, while a different machine showed Republicans winning every statewide race.Where elections generally can be vulnerable to either incompetence, corruption or both, the problem can sometimes be magnified when it comes to party primaries because they are subject to lower scrutiny from state officials – and sometimes no scrutiny at all. The Utah Republican caucus in 2016 raised few eyebrows because it produced a clear winner in Ted Cruz, but an online registration system intended to make it easier for eligible voters to participate failed dramatically, and it is unclear whether the party was ever able to issue a complete results tally.Again and again, going back to the 1890s, America’s loosely regulated election officials have been dazzled by the promise of new technology without understanding that the key to clean, accurate and transparent elections lies with competent, honest managers much more than the machines they use.“Technology alone does not eliminate the possibility of corruption and incompetence in elections,” the elections expert and computer scientist Rebecca Mercuri wrote in 1993. “It merely changes the platform on which they may occur.”While many jurisdictions across the country are competently run, the country’s history is littered with colorful and alarming examples of the opposite: the corrupt elections supervisor in Tampa, Florida, who in the early 1970s used a giant lever voting machine to smoke fish in his backyard, the uncounted paper ballots in San Francisco that had to be dried off in microwave ovens in 1997 after they were left unsecured in the rain, or the other uncounted paper ballots in San Francisco that, a few years later, were found dumped in a garbage can.For years, the Brennan Center for Justice and others have warned that ageing, poorly programmed machines constitute a serious security risk, particularly in an age where the fear of foreign hackers and other forms of outside interference has changed from a theoretical possibility into a documented reality.While there is no indication that the integrity of the Iowa caucus results has been compromised or otherwise corrupted, the episode nevertheless illustrates the shoddiness with which many election officials across many jurisdictions go about their business. More rigid oversight could potentially solve the problem overnight, but the United States is notorious for its failure to establish any central electoral authority with real teeth and its preference to leave election management in the hands of thousands of state and county offices, each subject to its own political pressures and competence problems.“Election supervisors generally rely on their vendors,” Rodriguez-Taseff said. “They do not have the knowledge they need and in many cases are not even given access to the software so they can learn the technology, know how to operate it and develop their own fixes.”Since the disastrous rollout of electronic touch screen machines in the early 2000s – largely financed by a federal law that was cobbled together at high speed in response to the Florida primary debacle of 2002 – many election supervisors have understood that low-tech voting systems are the easiest, cheapest and most reliable to operate.That, however, has not stopped some states including Georgia from ordering expensive new systems that raise more questions than they answer – or to yield to the temptations of online voting, despite repeated warnings from computer scientists of major, insurmountable security concerns.Even before Monday’s caucuses, Politico described Iowa as the “first election security test” of an anxiety-ridden 2020 election season. And it is now apparent it has failed the test."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd9cfed4c06316e79dfc27fd11b703cc6c634b/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a597ba78f1c20b7eac06ab8ee4c78","title":"grassroots activism tell us about a local campaign that worked","story":"Share your experience of being involved in a successful grassroots community movement Are you involved in a grassroots community project.

Here he writes about the stress of his evacuationAt 2.52pm, we arrived at Wuhan Tianjin airport.The drive here was smooth, all the big wide roads with no cars on them. We made it through the checkpoints and arrived within an hour.I said my goodbyes to my grandparents at the house, they were holding back tears. My dad sent me into the airport. After he sat around for a few minutes I told him to go home, and I’ll look after myself from there on.There were a lot of us evacuating, with two orthree other countries including us. Everyone’s wearing masks, and it was nerve-racking being around so many people in such close proximity. Hearing about a lot of evacuations with confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the flight, it was definitely not ideal to be around so many people at the airport.I found myself a quiet spot, and talked to my family and friends on my phone until we started lining up to get our boarding pass.At 4.30pm they told us after getting our boarding pass to wait for the security clearance to be opened, but to line up first because they’ll be a lot of different countries evacuating at once all through one entrance.It wasn’t until around 9.30pm that they started processing everyone. Our flight was due to leave at 11pm.I originally lined up behind everyone, again nervous of the close proximity. As it reached 10pm, I saw a lot of Chinese rushing to the front, and I was encouraged to join them, so I did. They were all going on the same Auckland flight as me, so we were allowed to cut the queue to be processed first.I felt a bit guilty, all these foreigners looking at us cutting the line, maybe they will think that we are getting special treatment because we are Chinese.There was this lady with her two young kids also evacuating and they were running late. I waited for them to bring them with me through the security. From there everyone was wearing full hazmat suits.It took us an hour to finally get through to immigration and the last security check point before our flight gate 334. It was already 11.10pm.I got through but the lady was stopped because she had ice skating shoes in the carry on which weren’t allowed. I told her to just leave them, but she was unwilling to. In the end, it was 11.20pm and I said I needed to go make the flight and I’ll tell them to wait for her and her kids.It was a huge rush and I thought I missed it because there was no one at the gate. But I made it just in time. I was on the phone to the embassy letting them know about the lady and kids. I hope they made it on.The flight itself wasn’t too bad, but we were delayed so didn’t leave until 1am.After having a really late dinner (or early breakfast) I fell asleep very quickly. Luckily there was a spare seat next to me so I sat next to the window and a girl sat on the other end, leaving plenty of space for each other.We were supplied with masks and hand sanitisers along with the normal flight care package. I woke up at 10 and went to the bathroom. We were encouraged to leave our seat as little as possible so I was hesitant.Used a lot of hand sanitisers throughout the flight along with everyone else. Everyone is just trying to avoid contact with each other as much as possible and constantly using hand sanitisers.We’ve arrived at New Zealand now. I have to prepare myself for another long flight back to Christmas Island, a huge detour. I’m nervous about being there.I heard from others there’s barely any wifi and no reception. There is nothing to do. Hopefully the facility is clean, and I can be out of there smoothly. I will want to try and keep everyone updated, but with the lack of reception and wifi, I think it’ll be very limited.I just want to get back home."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Voting was postponed after sudden death of Independent candidate Marese SkehanMother of man murdered in 2007 seeking apology from SF\u0026rsquos Conor Murphy over commentsThird arrest made as part of investigation into death of homeless man in Cork in 2019Economy, climate, Brexit register far lower when voters asked what should be prioritised Poll: One in eight voters think controversial event should have gone aheadNew guidelines allowing accused to question complainant a product of \u0026lsquoimperfect\u0026rsquo lawsApp says \u0026lsquodeeply private\u0026rsquo parts of exchanges withheld in subject rights requests\u0026lsquoNew model of childcare\u0026rsquo urged amid lack of State funding and soaring insurance costsLatest Ipsos MRBI poll suggests Taoiseach\u0026rsquos party could suffer casualtiesArchive files show London favoured John Bruton remaining in power in 1997 electionArchive files show suspicion period used to recruit volunteers, improve intelligenceTotal of 109 suspicious applications submitted to a number of financial institutionsVaradkar and Martin focus on Sinn F\u0026eacutein\u0026rsquos suitability to be a party of governmentRev David Bruce(62), from Co Down, said he was \u0026lsquohugely honoured and humbled\u0026rsquoAttorney General examining if postponement of the poll could be unconstitutionalChris Gordon (60) suing Irish Race Horse Trainers\u0026rsquo Association over letter to senior Turf Club stewardUnderbody portion of NCT inspections suspended following suspected lift faultsControversy around the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme led to the collapse of Stormont"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161767.1580841151!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish times poll it s not always the economy stupid","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Housing Eoghan Murphy during Fine Gael’s election manifesto launch in City Assembly House, Dublin.   Photograph :Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe natural order of politics in Ireland – either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil on top – has been upset only once before at a time of economic crisis – in 2010 voters lost faith in the two main parties and Labour surged to 33 per cent in our September poll of that year. What is intriguing about this latest upset is that it has happened without any obvious crisis or catalyst, such as an economic downturn or political scandal. There has also been a curious collapse in the Government’s satisfaction rating. As recently as October last year, 42 per cent of voters were satisfied with how the Government was running the country. Yet just a few months later this satisfaction rating has halved, down to just 21 per cent in this latest poll.An explanation is needed for this sudden and precipitous decline in Government satisfaction.For an answer we need look no further than health and housing. When voters were asked to give their view on what should be the priority for an incoming taoiseach, health (42 per cent) and housing (34 per cent) dominated. Challenges in health and housing are, arguably, generational and global, with no quick-fix solutions. Yet frustration with what voters see as a lack of progress has spilled over into this election, crowding out the Government’s achievements in other areas. The mood of voters has changed, even if the facts have not.What has facilitated this change of mood is the performance of our economy. Turn the clock back five years and the two most pressing issues for voters were jobs and the economy. The recovery has meant that jobs and the economy have taken a back seat, allowing health and housing to move front and centre.A growing economy has also given us permission to think less about how wealth is created and more about how wealth is shared. A majority of voters in our latest poll would like to see either most (18 per cent) or a little (52 per cent) of the surplus generated by a strong economy devoted to reducing taxes. About one in four (27 per cent) would not like to see any reduction. Surplus resourcesOpinion regarding whether surplus resources should be used to reduce taxes varies by party. At one end of the spectrum are Green voters, of whom only 48 per cent would like to see taxes reduced. At the other end are Sinn Féin voters, of whom three in four (75 per cent) are in favour of lowering taxes.The RIC commemoration has also emerged as an issue during this campaign. The decision to postpone is endorsed by a majority (68 per cent) of voters generally, and by a majority of supporters of each of the main parties.It has long been held that elections are won or lost on the economy. Whatever the outcome of the election on Saturday, this piece of conventional wisdom has been severely dented by the findings of this latest Ipsos MRBI poll. The main party of Government, Fine Gael, has received no electoral idend from having overseen a recovery in the economy, nor have Fianna Fáil for their role in supporting the Government.

In correspondence with the DPC last May, Tinder said there was “potential for deeply private information to be shared during the exchange of messages”.It said that it would not provide the messages the complainant was sent by other users, nor any other data related to other Tinder users “as this would lead to the unauthorised disclosure of other users’ personal data and would not align with their reasonable expectations that their usage and the messages they send on the Tinder platform are private”.Privacy expert Simon McGarr said subject access requests showed the scope of data gathered by companies about their users, but he also said there are limits to what will be made available to users.

Photograph: EPANiall CarsonUp until the final minutes of the last debate between the main party leaders, there had been no decisive moment that had the potential to change the dynamic of the election campaign.Leo Varadkar, Micheál Martin and Mary Lou McDonald had traded blows and insults, yet there was nothing that would stick in the memory or follow through to the final days of of Election 2020. Then, almost 90 minutes in, moderator Miriam O’Callaghan raised the murder of Paul Quinn, the 21-year-old from Cullyhanna, Co Armagh, who was brutally killed on October 20th 2007.Paul’s mother Breege has in recent days raised comments made around that time by Conor Murphy, Sinn Féin’s finance minister in Stormont, and one of the most senior figures in the organisation.“He came out publicly and called Paul a criminal on national television,” Mrs Quinn said this week of Murphy.This was put to McDonald in an interview with RTÉ’s Bryan Dobson on Monday, and she responded that she did not think one of her key lieutenants had made such comments.Prime Time had found the exact quote and read it back to McDonald.Murphy said in 2007: “Paul Quinn was involved in smuggling and criminality. I think everyone accepts that.”O’Callaghan read this to McDonald, who replied that she remembered “Conor being not quite as direct on that matter.” She was visibly shaken, adding: “Those things should not have been said.”ModeratedWith Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael both trying to halt Sinn Féin’s momentum, it was a big moment. In the final few minutes, the Sinn Féin leader, perhaps rattled, also came unstuck on her party’s climate change policies. “Massive means ambitious and substantial,” she said when pressed for specifics at one point. She had earlier taken the scenic route to dealing with the question of whether she supports the Special Criminal Court: dealing with it, but not actually answering. “I support the courts,” she said, while also repeating her view that the Special Criminal Court needed to be reviewed. “I believe that we need special powers.” The Dublin Central TD was a late entrant to what was initially supposed to be a head-to-head between Martin and Varadkar, with RTÉ changing its position because of Sinn Féin’s surging poll figures. It was well moderated by O’Callaghan and David McCullagh, who gave the leaders of the three parties time and space to answer questions and set out their positions.Point scoringMcDonald was strong at some points, such as explaining her party’s position on a wealth tax, and weaker on others, such as her attempts to explain how Sinn Féin will build 100,000 new homes. But she performed well on other housing issues, clearly outlining why her party thinks a rent freeze is a good idea, and once more stitching Varadkar and Martin together.“These two men have been in government for the last four years,” she said. This week’s Ipsos MRBI opinion poll had Sinn Féin on 25 per cent support, followed by Fianna Fáil on 23 per cent and Fine Gael on 20 per cent. Varadkar, perhaps conscious that he was starting from behind, opened his debate performance by attacking both Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin but a rushed delivery belied his nerves. He improved as the debate progressed and tried to make the Fine Gael argument that “all change isn’t for the better”, instancing Brexit and the election Donald Trump.He was also successful in asking McDonald about the rates of homelessness, health outcomes and other issues in Northern Ireland, causing her to fall back and blame London and the Tories. As in previous debates, Varadkar tried to hammer home his message that only Fine Gael can be trusted with the economy. He also tried wanly to raise Brexit, perhaps knowing that it has been a non issue throughout the campaign. On health, another strong point was when he admitted that no-one really knows for sure when waiting lists will be cleared and his party was wrong to make promises on that front before.‘Mansplain’Martin was the butt of probably the two best lines of the night – one from Varadkar saying bringing him back to power would be like bringing John Delaney back to run the FAI, and the other from McDonald asking if he was going to “mansplain” corporation tax to her – but he put in a competent and assured performance.He spoke with empathy on the issue of housing, claiming – as his party does - that Fine Gael left too much to the market to figure out as the crisis worsened in recent years.He also performed as someone confident in himself as the campaign draws to a close, and landed a hit on Varadkar by reminding the Taoiseach that he once said bringing more beds into the health system would ease pressure on staff and decrease productivity. Martin’s attacks on Sinn Féin – that it “magicked up the figures” in its manifesto – also stung and his performance was calmer and more considered than previous debates. He also turned what was a weakness – a confused policy on a rent freeze - into a strength, by saying he would not be making unrealisable promises before entering government.Both he and Varadkar were evenly matched throughout, although Varadkar probably pulled ahead as the night drew to a close. Martin stumbled on who in his party had EU experience, citing himself, Éamon Ó Cuív and Brendan Smith. Varadkar was the strongest overall but went much of the night without landing the decisive blow that he needed. Yet the moment when McDonald was told exactly what Conor Murphy had said about Paul Quinn is what will be remembered.

File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsAttorney General Séamus Woulfe will hand the Government legal advice today on whether the entire General Election could be open to a legal challenge after the death of a candidate in Tipperary, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Voting in Tipperary has been postponed after the sudden death of Independent candidate Marese Skehan.James Seymour, returning officer for the constituency, said the postponement was required under the Electoral Act 1992.It states that a returning officer must countermand a poll in the constituency where the death of a candidate has occurred and to arrange the holding of a fresh election.However, Article 16. 3.2 of the Constitution, states that a general election must be held not later than 30 days after the dissolution of the Dáil.It is understood the Attorney General is concerned that the result of the general election in the other 38 constituencies could face a legal challenge if the Tipperary vote was not held on the same date.“What is happening at the moment is the Attorney General is preparing legal advice as to what the options are, and the legal risks, if you like,” Mr Varadkar told Newstalk’s The Pat Kenny Show.The Minister for Local Government would need to sign an order to allow the election in Tipperary to proceed on Saturday.On the prospect of a legal challenge to either polling going ahead in Tipperary on Saturday or a subsequent challenge to the entire general election, Mr Varadkar said the Electoral Act 1992 is “a law of unintended consequences” and those who wrote it “probably didn’t foresee this situation arising”.“Elections, referendums are always open to legal challenge,” he said.“We’ve seen a few referendums challenged in the courts. Thankfully the courts decided not to overturn the results.“So essentially what Minister Murphy will have to do is get the best advice from the Attorney General, and act on that in such a way that it minimises the risk to either the election in Tipperary or the whole general election being challenged.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161803.1580842451!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish times poll health and housing most important issues for voters","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUrban voters and younger voters are more concerned with housing, while rural voters and older voters give health a higher priority.  Photograph: Getty ImagesHealth and housing remain the voters’ most important issues, with the economy, climate change and Brexit barely registering when they are asked what should be the priority for the next government, according to the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll.However, voters also want the next government to reduce taxes if it has resources to spare, with almost a fifth of voters (18 per cent) saying they want most available resources to be used to reduce taxes and 52 per cent preferring “a little” of the available resources to be used for that purpose. Some 27 per cent of respondents do not wish to see taxes reduced at all. The poll was taken on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last week among 1,200 respondents in every constituency. The margin of error is estimated at 2.8 per cent.The results confirm the dominant issues of the campaign as health and housing, and suggest that voters expect action on these fronts by the next government. Asked to pick one from a list of issues, 42 per cent of respondents said that health was the issue that should be a priority for the incoming taoiseach, with 34 per cent nominating housing. Just 12 per cent said the economy should be the priority issue, while 6 per cent said climate change and 3 per cent said Brexit.Urban voters and younger voters are more concerned with housing, while rural voters and older voters give health a higher priority. Housing is the number one priority for almost half of voters in Dublin (49 per cent), while concern declines outside the capital. In the rest of Leinster (47 per cent), Munster (49 per cent) and Connacht-Ulster (47 per cent), voters say health should be the number one priority for the next government. DivisionThere is also a ision between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael voters and the supporters of other parties on the housing issue. While just a quarter of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail voters say housing should be the number one priority for the next government, the number rises sharply among voters from the other parties – to 45 per cent of Sinn Féin voters and 46 per cent of Labour voters. Voters were also asked what the next government should do if it has resources to spare – use most of it to reduce taxes, use a little to reduce taxes or not reduce taxes at all.A large majority are in favour of some tax cuts – 70 per cent say that the government should use either most or a little of the extra resources for this purpose. However, by far the greater portion are in favour of minor tax cuts – 52 per cent say the government should use a little of the extra resources to reduce taxes, with 18 per cent saying most of the available resources should be used for this purpose.Perhaps surprisingly, the party most in favour of using most of the available resources to reduce taxes was Sinn Féin – 26 per cent of its voters choosing this option.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsLegal consultations are under way to see if the general election for the Tipperary elections can be held on Saturday as originally scheduled despite the death of one of the candidates on Monday.The Office of the Attorney General has been examining if the postponement of the vote in Tipperary until the possible date of Saturday, February 29th could be deemed unconstitutional.A decision to put back the holding of the election in Tipperary was announced on Monday following the sudden death of independent candidate, Marese Skehan.The returning officer for the constituency, James Seymour, said the postponement was required under the Electoral Act 1992.It stipulates that a returning officer must countermand a poll in the constituency where the death of a candidate has occurred and to arrange the holding of a fresh election.However, Article 16. 3.2 of the Constitution, states that a general election must be held not later than 30 days after the dissolution of the Dáil.A spokesman for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government confirmed on Tuesday night that the Attorney General, Séamus Woulfe, SC had been examining various legal issues around the general election which arose following Ms Skehan’s death.It is understood the Attorney General is concerned that the result of the general election in the other 38 constituencies could face a legal challenge if the Tipperary vote was not held on the same date.RTÉ reported that Independent TD for Tipperary, Mattie McGrath sent a letter to Mr Woulfe’s office on Tuesday evening warning that a legal challenge would be initiated next week if the vote in his constituency was postponed.An order would need to be signed by Minister for Local Government Eoghan Murphy to allow the election in Tipperary to proceed on Saturday.A Government source said a decision was likely to be taken very soon on what should happen given the narrow timeframe before the weekend poll.A death during the campaign last happened in the Carlow constituency in 1948.Some 700 postal votes including those of Defence Forces personnel and diplomats have already been cast in Tipperary, as well as 900 votes including residents of nursing homes and hospital patients.The constituency is seen as likely to have a bearing on government formation talks and the Dáil is expected to meet on February 20th because the proclamation President Michael D Higgins issued when the Dáil was dissolved obliges the House to meet.The President would be required to sign a new proclamation on the advice of the Taoiseach in order to delay the sitting if the Tipperary vote was delayed. If the Dáil sits it is likely that TDs will be asked to elect a new taoiseach and ceann comhairle.Ms Skehan, a home help co-ordinator with Thurles Community Social Services and the HSE, will be buried on Thursday in St Patrick’s cemetery after funeral services in Ryan’s Funeral Home in Thurles at 10am.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Politics latest: BBC licence fee could be scrapped within seven years, the Culture Secretary has suggestedSecond cruise ship placed under quarantine in Hong Kong over coronavirus fearsDiane Abbott under fire for saying it was \u0026#39unlikely\u0026#39 David Leakey was bullied because he served in the militaryRoyal Mail sued by postwoman for £50,000 after dog bit off two fingers during rounds amid claims she wasn\u0026#39t warned about animalBanker\u0026#39s wife who spent millions in Harrods loses legal challenge over £11m home   Harvey Weinstein jurors shown naked photos of movie mogulUS Election 2020 Democratic primary race: Who is winning the battle for delegates?School on \u0026#39lockdown\u0026#39 with children kept inside as armed police attend nearby property UK scientists make \u0026#39significant breakthrough\u0026#39 in race for coronavirus vaccine Coronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world Greenpeace protesters block entrance to BP with solar panels and oil barrels to mark boss\u0026#39s first dayWatch: Nancy Pelosi rips up Donald Trump\u0026#39s State of the Union speech Pete Buttigieg takes lead in chaotic Iowa Democratic voteFive things we learned from Donald Trump\u0026#39s State of the Union addressWednesday morning news briefing: Tensions flare at State of the UnionWhy Brexit hero Leo Varadkar is staring down the barrel of defeat in Irish electionComment: We’re far too complacent about Islamist extremismWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saudi has become north korea mbs says satirist suing kingdom","story":"It was an offer Ghanem al-Masarir should not have had to consider for long before accepting.A weekly column with the Washington Post would be great exposure for the Saudi Arabian comedian and satirist, who had made a name for himself in the Arab world but was struggling to break through to Western audiences.Yet it was exposure he has been avoiding since the last man in the job was murdered 16 months ago by agents of the Saudi government.“There is a lot to think about. Of course I want the platform, but I risk becoming a second Jamal,” Mr Masarir told the , referring to Jamal Khashoggi, the late Saudi journalist and dissident who was killed in his country’s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.Mr Masariri, 39, became famous for his YouTube channel “The Ghanem Show”, which he hosts from exile in the UK. The show, which criticised the Saudi royal family, earned him a legion of fans but also one powerful enemy - Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.As the channel’s popularity increased - at one point his videos were receiving tens of millions of views - so did the harassment.The offer of a column came the same week as reports that Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and the world’s richest person, had seen his Twitter and other social media accounts allegedly hacked by the crown prince or MBS, himself.One of few not surprised by the news was Mr Masarir, whose own phone is suspected to have been infiltrated by Saudi hackers he is now suing. “What was interesting is that we seem to have all been hacked in the same period of time - mid-late 2018,” said Mr Masarir. “Me, Jeff Bezos, Jamal, Omar (Abdulaziz, a Saudi activist in Canada), and that’s just the people we know about. “Something was going on with Saudi at this time, a paranoia,” he told the  via end-to-end encrypted messaging service Signal - the app of choice for the privacy-conscious as it is virtually impenetrable.He first suspected something was wrong when his iPhone’s iOS software was not updating, so he sent it off for analysis at Citizen Lab, the cybersecurity organisation at the University of Toronto.Experts assessed the phones of both Mr Masarir and Mr Abdulaziz and found spyware infections with identical elements — both were surreptitiously installed through a fake DHL package delivery link — and led to the same Saudi-controlled server.“Absolutely nobody in Saudi would do such a thing without the approval of MBS,” said Mr Masarir, suggesting he believed the hacks had been ordered at the very top.“I’m not Bezos, they didn’t blackmail me. I don’t have anything interesting enough,” he jokes. “What they want is to know everything about you: who you are contacting, what you are doing and saying. It gives them complete access to your private life in.”Mr Masarir, who has been living under police protection in north London since Mr Khashoggi’s assassination, last month filed a lawsuit against the Saudi government at the High Court in London, in an extremely rare case against the ultra-conservative kingdom.He wants an apology and unspecified damages. Saudi has three months to respond to his lawyers before they take the next step.There are few legal precedents and should the case reach court it will shine an uncomfortable spotlight on Riyadh’s alleged campaign of harassment of its critics. Not only that, it could broaden the scope of liability for cyber attacks.“He (MBS) has been running a campaign to silence critics and he has been successful,” Mr Masarir said. “For years it has seemed like the regime could not be touched by the legal system but finally I have the opportunity to hold them to account.Despite the reforms taking place under MBS, including women’s right to drive, the loosening of male ship restrictions and the opening up to tourism, he claims the kingdom has never been more repressive.“I speak to people inside Saudi and they tell me ‘we are like North Korea,’” he said. “The only difference is we have money and a good relationship with America and the West.”Mr Masarir, who has long been vocal of his government, arrived in the UK in 2003 to take up a place on the University of Portsmouth\u0027s computer science course. When his student visa ran out he applied for political asylum in 2012, though it would not be granted until 2018: a delay, he claims, that was down to Saudi pressure on the British government.He has taken a break from filming The Ghanem Show but still worries about his safety in the UK, pointing to his host country’s close relationship with the kingdom.The two are important trade partners. The British government even licensed the sale of £600 million worth of military equipment to Saudi six months after the murder of Mr Khashoggi. The hacking attempts on Mr Masarir have not stopped either. Just minutes before our interview he received prompts from Google to change his email passwords, suggesting someone was trying to access his accounts.He also continues to be targeted by an army of pro-Saudi government “bots” on Twitter, which send him hundreds of messages a day intended to intimidate him.But Mr Masarir is determined to not let them succeed, publishing his first op-ed in the Washington Post last week. “(At first) I kept my opposition to the Saudi regime quiet, but as time passed I felt the need to speak up for those who still suffered,” he told the Post’s readers.“It felt good to speak out,” he said of the column this week, “and I’ve missed writing, but I don’t know yet whether it can be a regular gig.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"far complacent islamist extremism","story":"Truly committed Islamist terrorists like Sudesh Amman remain a threat even after they have been brought to justiceThe judicial system needs to wise up to prevent the premature release of unrepentant terroristsBritain has been waging a war against Islamist extremists for the better part of two decades. Yet, to judge by the latest terrorist attack to take place in broad daylight on a British street, those responsible for tackling Islamist extremism are still struggling to devise an effective formula for dealing with would-be jihadis.For all the talk we have heard from successive prime ministers, from Tony Blair to Theresa May, about getting tough with those responsible for plotting and carrying out acts of Islamist-inspired terrorism, the fact that London has just suffered its second attack by a convicted terrorist in two months suggests that we are a long way from having measures in place to prevent further carnage.True, it is hard to know for sure whether someone who has previously been convicted of terrorism is intent on committing further crimes after being released from prison or is seriously interested in mending their ways. That certainly appeared to be the case with Usman Khan, who managed to persuade British officials he was interested in ditching his allegiance to militant Islam, only to launch a frenzied attack on London Bridge last November, killing two people and stabbing three others before he was shot dead by police marksmen.There were no such reservations in the case of Sudesh Amman, who, following his release from Belmarsh prison at the end of last month, was deemed to be so dangerous that his movements were closely monitored by a specialist counter-terrorism police unit.Amman, who was jailed for three years and four months at the Old Bailey in November 2018, after pleading guilty to numerous terrorist offences, was released after serving just half of his sentence, even though he did not display the slightest hint of remorse for his crimes.It was for this reason, and the fact that he remained utterly committed to the Islamist cause, that Amman was placed under surveillance from the moment he was released. But not even this sensible precaution could prevent Amman from attacking two innocent bystanders in Streatham, south London, on Sunday before, like Khan before him, he was shot dead by police marksmen.The ease with which committed terrorists like Khan and Amman have been able to play the system in such a way that they have been able to go on to commit more serious acts of terrorism than those that led to their incarceration raises serious questions about its effectiveness.Richard Walton, the former head of counter terrorism at the politan Police, says Britain is “soft” in its approach to hardened terrorists, while Boris Johnson says he has “come to the end of my patience” when it comes to their early release.Robert Buckland, the Justice Secretary, has responded by introducing emergency legislation to block the automatic release of terrorist offenders after serving half their sentences, which is a welcome step in the right direction.Yet, at a time when organisations such as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) show no sign of ending their murderous assaults against the West, the Government needs to harden even further its response to those deemed to pose an active threat to our national security.Despite the recent success coalition forces from the US, Britain and other Western countries have enjoyed in defeating the likes of Isil in Syria and Iraq, all the indications are that the threat remains as potent as ever as Isil and its associates seek to take advantage of political instability in the Middle East to regroup.In Iraq, Isil fighters are said to be forming new terror cells, while Islamist militants in Libya are eyeing opportunities to exploit the country’s descent into full-scale civil war to their advantage.Therefore, rather than viewing the threat as being in decline, which seems to be the view of many of those responsible for overseeing Britain’s approach to Islamist-inspired extremism, the Government needs to go much further than adjusting the parole terms of terrorists.There is, for example, a long established principle in relation to those convicted of other serious criminal offences, such as murder, that they must admit their guilt, as well as displaying genuine remorse, before they are considered suitable for release.And officials need to be far less naive when it comes to assessing those who claim to be interested in ending their association with extremism by signing up for deradicalisation programmes.From the formation of Al-Qaeda onwards, Islamist militants have been taught to comply with the judicial systems of Western countries with the aim of ultimately gaining their freedom and being able to return to the battlefield.And, as we have learnt to our cost from the recent cases involving Khan and Amman, truly committed Islamist terrorists remain a threat even after they have been brought to justice.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

This issue was identified and fixed.It was reported that a technology company called Shadow had been paid $60,000 before Christmas to create the app.Electoral officials who reverted back to the old system of calling in results over the phone complained of long delays, with some saying they were stuck on hold for more than an hour.Both the leading candidates would be a historic break with precedent if they win the nomination. Mr Sanders is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist pledging political revolution. Mr Buttigieg hopes to be both youngest person ever to reach the White House and the first openly gay US president.Campaign staff for Mr Biden, who appeared to be heading for a poor result, wrote a letter to the Iowa Democratic Party complaining about its handling of the caucuses.The row has renewed calls for Iowa to end its idiosyncratic system of caucuses, in which people vote by moving to different corners of a room, one area for each candidate, where they are then counted.The local party had initially put out a statement blaming “inconsistencies” in the reporting of three different sets of results - a change to the procedures which only took effect this year. The statement added: “This is not a hack or an intrusion.”Mr Buttigieg, campaigning later in New Hampshire, said: We still have to do some math. But we are coming here with momentum.Mrs Warren,also in New Hampshire, said: I think they ought to get it together and release all the data.Meanwhile, Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire candidate who did not compete in Iowa, sensed opportunity amid the chaos.He announced plans to double his TV advertising spending, which has already exceeded $100 million, in states that vote later. Sabrina Singh, his spokeswoman, said: No one has made the sale or even come close to it.Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and longtime Biden supporter, who served as an Iowa precinct captain for Biden on Monday, said: I think Iowa is a dumpster fire.Democrat voters in Iowa also criticised the process.Jessica Leonard, 41, who runs a food truck in Winterset, Iowa, said: It looks like a disorganised mess.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/17/15/shutterstock-editorial-1549912a.jpg","title":"fast fashion giving up climate change 20 pledges 2020","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘There can be no denying that your money goes further on the high street’For the new year, I’ve decided to give up fast fashion. That means no popping into M\u0026ampS for a multipack of pants. No rummaging through Primark for sale socks. And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress.\u0026nbspI write about fashion as part of my job, so I\u0027m constantly keeping an eye on new boutique brands and emerging designers, who, in all honesty, I\u0027d rather give my money to than high-street brands. Not just because it supports new talent, but because the clothes tend to be more innovative and you\u0027re less likely to show up somewhere wearing the same damn polka dot dress as every other woman there. When I first announced to my friends that I’d be giving up fast fashion, they didn’t even flinch, saying: “You think you’re too cool to shop on the high street anyway.”\u0026nbsp That said, there can be no denying that your money goes further on the high street. So I love the odd haul at Zara, H\u0026ampM, or \u0026amp Other Stories that usually happens after I’ve walked past and been seduced by something in the window. And while I’d rather source my clothes from unique second-hand shops I’ve visited on trips abroad, or designer-loaded charity shops in wealthy areas of London – there are still plenty of occasions where I have to hit the high street to get what I need because of some kind of urgent wardrobe-related mishap, like a broken zip or ripped trousers.\u0026nbspThere’s also my occasional splurging habit to consider. Occasionally I save up to buy a special piece from one of my favourite (more expensive) brands: Ganni, Rixo, APC… In my head, these are more eco-friendly purchases simply because they cost more and I’ll keep them for longer. But my logic – that more money automatically means more sustainable – is obviously flawed and based on, well, nothing.\u0026nbsp I have no idea if these purchases count as fast fashion or not because I’ve never bothered to ask.

I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement.

The column-shaped, one-shouldered dress features three straps and was constructed with fabric that fanned out from the waist to reveal folds and cuts like a sunray, twisting around Harris\u0027 torso and elevating the power and authority of her character, who remains one of the most memorable “Bond Girls” of all time. OP550 46 - Suzy Bishop\u0027s pink dress in Moonrise Kingdom, 2012This dress in Wes Anderson\u0027s 2012 Moonrise Kingdom embodies all the childhood innocence and nostalgia that defines the film. From its bubblegum-coloured hue and its Peter Pan collar to the Sixties A-line cut and the knee-high socks it\u0027s worn with, this dress was one of the best costumes in cinema from the last decade. No, it wasn\u0027t grand. And it certainly didn\u0027t look expensive, either. But, like the film itself, the dress is an homage to childlike nativity and it couldn\u0027t have been more appropriate.

SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumIn 2016 supermodel Bella Hadid attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing an Alexandre Vauthier gown that featured a slit that went above the thigh. The look prompted hundreds of headlines around the world and instantly became one of Hadid’s most memorable in addition to firmly heralding her arrival into the fashion industry. OPFor Bill Condon’s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the director enlisted the help of Academy Award-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran to create Belle\u0027s (Emma Watson) famous yellow gown. The dress itself featured multiple layers of yolk yellow-dyed organza and 2,160 Swarovski crystals and it took a team of seamstresses more than 12,000 hours to make. The significance of Watson’s gown was bolstered by the fact that it lit up our screens a mere two months after Emma Stone’s similarly sunshine yellow gown did the same in La La Land. Yellow went on to reign as the colour of the season that year and was soon dubbed the next millennial pink, earning the nickname “Gen Z yellow”. OPOPIf Instagram had a fling with a tutu, their child would look something like Viktor \u0026amp Rolf’s slogan dresses. With messages like “I\u0027m not shy, I just don\u0027t like you,” “Sorry I\u0027m late, I didn\u0027t want to come,” and “NO,” these voluminous tulle gowns made quite the statement when they graced the runway at Paris Couture Week in January. Not only did it suddenly seem like all our darkest and most millennial thoughts were suddenly displayed on gargantuan tutus, but said tutus went on to almost break the internet with the countless memes they prompted. People shared the photos in WhatsApp groups, tagged themselves on social media, and captioned them with things like ”Mood”. OPFor the 2019 Grammy Awards, rapper Cardi B arrived on the red carpet wearing a look straight out of a Botticelli painting. The Little Mermaid. SYIn 2012, Angelina Jolie quite literally stepped out in a black Atelier Versace gown that came with a thigh-high slit, revealing much of the actor’s leg. Jolie posed for photographers with her right leg pointed outwards, to exaggerate the slit and ensured that almost every image showed her in that pose. Showing true dedication, Jolie even maintained the pose when she presented an award on stage. The stance generated a flurry of memes and a hashtag: #AngiesRightLeg. OPDressing a First Lady for the inauguration is a momentous occasion, and one that many designers consider to be the greatest honour of their career. So, when Michelle Obama chose a relatively unknown name within the fashion sphere for the occasion, critics were taken by surprise. For her debut as First Lady, Obama chose an ivory, one-shouldered gown designed by 26-year-old Jason Wu, who was a relatively little known designer at the time. Like the rest of the world, Wu had no idea that the Obama was seriously considering wearing one of his designs and claimed that he wasn\u0027t even sure that the white chiffon dress she wore was his until the phone began to ring. “It\u0027s difficult to describe,” Wu said the following afternoon, after appearing on the morning shows. “I was over the moon. I know I am an unusual choice for a first lady. I didn\u0027t think it was my turn yet.” SYThe video for Beyonce’s visual album Lemonade in 2016 was filled with fashion that had the world abuzz, from a floral Gucci suit to a two-piece Yeezy ensemble.When Jennifer Lopez wore this dress to the 2000 Grammys it went down in fashion history, second only to Elizabeth Hurley’s iconic safety pin moment in 1994. Over the years, numerous brands have tried to copy the Versace gown but no one has managed to do it justice quite like J.Lo herself. In September 2019, the singer gave the fashion pack a dose of nostalgia at Milan Fashion Week by closing the Versace show wearing an updated version of the gown 20 years later. The crowd rose to its feet as J.Lo walked the room before linking arms with Donatella Versace for the final applause. The gown is also the reason we now have Google Images. Following Lopez’s 2000 appearance, people were so fascinated by the dress that they tried to search for photos on Google. In February, the Pose star became the most talked-about guest at the Oscars thanks to his tuxedo gown, designed by Christian Siriano. But Porter’s gown didn’t just defy sartorial conventions by blending a suit with a dress, it subverted gender norms and reflected a key societal shift. In the last year, we’ve seen more and more brands create unisex lines, showing that there is no such thing as dressing according to your gender and giving way for all of us to feel a little bit more liberated about the clothes we wear. Speaking about the gown to Variety, Porter described wearing it as a form of activism. “I knew that that tuxedo gown at the Oscars would create a conversation surrounding what gender means, what all these rules we put on everybody in life,” he said. “We’ve gotten past a problem with women wearing pants. When women wear pants it’s powerful. When men wear a dress it’s disgusting. We’re not doing that anymore. I’m not doing it.” OPWhile Meghan Markle opted for a white Givenchy wedding dress designed by artistic director Clare Waight Keller for her wedding ceremony, the bride turned to Stella McCartney for her reception gown. The Duchess of Sussex looked every bit the duchess  in the white silk halterneck gown which featured a dramatic low back and full-length skirt. The elegant dress drew compliments the world over and prompted many a copycat design before the actual dress itself became available to buy online for £3,500. According to McCartney, Markle chose her because she is a female British designer. I think being a woman and being a women’s woman played a part,” McCartney said. SYWhen an item of clothing becomes more synonymous with a breakfast than the designer who spent two years making it, you pay attention. The yolk yellow gown that Rihanna wore to the Met Gala in 2015 spawned so many memes that it’s hard to keep track of them all. Items photo-shopped onto the dress by social media users included pepperoni pizza and a Gregg’s sausage roll, but it was memes that reimagined RiRi’s gown as an omelette that acquired the most notoriety. To this day, you can ask anyone engaged with popular culture about the omelette dress and they will immediately know what you’re talking about. In fact, the elaborate caped gown was created by Chinese couturier Guo Pei and took two years to make. Two pieces by Pei were being shown at the Costume Institute that year as part of the “China: Through the Looking Glass” exhibition, which the Met Gala was held to celebrate.OPIn 2015, the internet was ided after a photo of a dress functioned as an accidental experiment in colour perception.Never has tulle caused such a ruckus. When Jodie Comer stomped across our screens in Killing Eve wearing Balenciaga biker boots and Molly Goddard’s frothy pink dress, it turned the British designer into a household name. OPFor the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards, Lady Gaga turned her back on the usual glamorous red carept garb, wearing dress made from raw flank steak, complete with matching ankle boots, a handbag and hat. In an interview with the Financial Times, Lady Gaga said the look referred to a speech she made, The Prime Rib of America, which urged the US military not to discriminate against gay men and lesbians from serving in the army. In 2015, the dress was put on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.  SY4950 2 - The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding dress, Alexander McQueen, 2011Kate Middleton and Prince William\u0027s wedding on 29 April 2011 included many memorable moments but no detail has stood the test of time quite like the duchess’s iconic wedding dress. SY5050 1 - The black dresses at the Golden Globes, 2018While the Golden Globes are typically cause for celebration, 2018’s ceremony served as the scene of a major protest. Countless actors, presenters and nominees – including Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone – chose to wear all-black clothing in protest of sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond. The move was a symbolic show of solidarity with victims of sexual harassment as part of the Time’s Up movement. Speaking about her decision to wear black to the event, Allison Brie said: I am wearing black to stand in solidarity with all of the women who have come out about being sexually harassed and abused. I\u0027m so in awe of the bravery it took for the first few to come forward. They are heroes. Out of all the women who attended the 2018 globes, just three chose not to wear black. SYAll things considered, then, I presumed this pledge would be easy. I’d finally kick my \u0026amp Other Stories habit, something that might harm\u0026nbspthe planet as much as it harms my wallet, and enjoy the feeling of knowing I’ll be making better, more sustainable sartorial choices. But having given this some thought, I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about waving goodbye to the ease and accessibility that high street shopping allows. What if I ladder my tights at work? Or forget to pack a second pair of underwear for after my lunchtime gym session? Such issues arise – all too often for me – and it’s arguably easiest to solve them by heading to the nearest high street shop, which, let’s face it, is probably not going to sell eco-friendly lingerie.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m like: ‘This doesn’t sound right’,” he told the Financial Times.Why is everyone so worried about Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency?Visa also cited concerns about financial inclusion when it pulled out, with the company saying it would instead focus its efforts on the the mobile payments platform M-Pesa.The questions are part of the much broader scrutiny that has surrounded Libra since it was first unveiled in 2019.Some politicians in the US and Europe have called for its development to be halted, with French finance minister Bruno Le Maire\u0026nbspsaying in September that he would block the development of Libra on European soil as it poses a threat to monetary sovereignty.More recently, Swiss finance minister Ueli Maurer\u0026nbspsaid it would not be accepted by central banks and had therefore failed in its current form.Libra\u0027s failure to commit to not do anything that is not fully compliant with local law was one of the reasons Mr Banga\u0026nbspcited for Mastercard\u0027s withdrawal.Libra did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has previously said the digital currency\u0027s development would continue regardless of partners pulling out.Dante Disparte, head of policy at the Libra Association, said in a recent statement: Although the makeup of the Association members may change over time, the design of Libra\u0027s governance and technology ensures the Libra payment system will remain resilient.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That number drops to one on 50 nationally, and outside mainland China, one death has been recorded per 114 confirmed cases.\u0026nbspExperts said the discrepancy was mainly due to under-reporting of milder virus cases in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei province that are grappling with shortages in testing equipment and beds.\u0026nbspIn an outbreak you\u0026nbspreally have to interpret fatality rates with a very sceptical eye, because often it\u0027s only the very severe cases that are coming to people\u0027s attention, said Amesh Adalja, an expert in pandemic preparedness at the Johns Hopkins Centre\u0026nbspfor Health Security in Baltimore.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s very hard to say those numbers represent anything like the true burden of infection said Dr Adalja, who estimates current fatality rates are likely below 1 per cent.\u0026nbspAs of Tuesday, 24,551 cases have been confirmed globally. A 1 per cent\u0026nbspfatality rate would put total cases at over 49,000, based on the current death toll of 492.\u0026nbspGauden Galea, the World Health Organisation representative for China, told Reuters on Sunday that a crude calculation done by iding total cases by deaths put the rate at 2 per cent\u0026nbspand said the rate was generally falling.\u0026nbspTrying to really demystify those fatality numbers by including mildly symptomatic cases will help people to better understand the risk, said Dr Adalja.\u0026nbspReutersHack attack\u0026nbspHackers are leveraging the fears surrounding coronavirus in order to carry out cyber attacks on a massive scale, security researchers have warned,\u0026nbspwrites\u0026nbspAnthony Cuthbertson.\u0026nbspMalware and email viruses that use coronavirus-themed lures to trick people have spread to over a dozen countries, according to security firm Proofpoint.\u0026nbspThe company also observed that attackers are beginning to register URLs and create fake websites relating to Coronavirus in order to carry out malicious activity.\u0026nbspThe time needed to produce a vaccine against coronavirus has been dramatically cut from years to just days, according to a British scientist, writes\u0026nbspShaun Lintern.\u0026nbspRobin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, told Sky News he is now at the stage to start testing the vaccine on animals as early as next week with human studies in the summer if enough funding is secured.\u0026nbspHe said: “Conventional approaches usually take at least two to three years before you even get to the clinic. And we\u0027ve gone from that sequence to generating a candidate in the laboratory in 14 days.\u0026nbspHe is one of a number of scientists across the world racing to develop a vaccine to the new virus.\u0026nbspEarlier this week a global alliance of scientists said they were also on course to create a vaccine in record time.\u0026nbspThe head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said he hoped a vaccine could be produced for clinical testing within 16 weeks from initial gene sequencing of the virus.\u0026nbspDr Richard Hatchett said: “This is an extremely ambitious timeline – indeed, it would be unprecedented in the field of vaccine development.”Virus brings people together\u0026nbspMany Hong Kongers who formerly opposed the pro-democracy movement have had their sentiments altered after witnessing the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, particularly Carrie Lam’s reticence to take control,\u0026nbspwrites\u0026nbspBrian McGleenon.\u0026nbspThe need for greater autonomy from China now seems justifiable even to former critics, the threat of the encroaching pathogen quickly unravelling Beijing’s “one country, two systems” principle and the argument for greater self-determination evolving from one of ideology to one of survival.\u0026nbspBaby riskDoctors in a Wuhan children\u0027s hospital say coronavirus may be transmittable from mother to baby, after a newborn was confirmed to have been infected, Reuters reports citing state television.\u0026nbspA woman gave birth to a baby on 2 February who tested positive just 30 hours later.Difficulty policing outbreak\u0026nbspChinese authorities are arresting a growing number of people for breaking quarantine rules and hiding the fact they\u0027ve visited coronavirus-hit areas of the country, according to a report from CNN.\u0026nbspState media further reported a specific case in which a man who worked in Wuhan returned home, failed to isolate himself, lied to officials about where he\u0027d been and concealed symptoms including fever.\u0026nbspThe man\u0027s son - who had travelled abroad - also came with him, the state media outlet said. Both are infected with coronavirus.\u0026nbspTesla halts deliveriesTesla will temporarily delay a planned delivery of some Chinese-made Model 3 vehicles that was due in early February, an executive has said.\u0027Rely on the facts\u0027\u0026nbspSenior medical and assistance experts have urged travellers to keep the risks of the new coronavirus in perspective,\u0026nbspwrites\u0026nbspSimon Calder.\u0026nbspDr Mark Parrish, regional medical director for International SOS, told The Independent: “A 2 per cent death rate for this virus is lower than 35 per cent for coronavirus when it mutated into Middle East respiratory virus, which is still happening, and 10 per cent for Sars.\u0026nbspMore China deaths\u0026nbspThe coronavirus\u0026nbspdeath toll in mainland China has risen to 490, authorities said early on Wednesday.\u0026nbspTotal cases have\u0026nbsprisen to 24,324, as officials move\u0026nbsppatients into newly built or converted hospitals in the hardest-hit city of Wuhan.\u0026nbspThe latest figures are up from 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed cases on Tuesday.\u0026nbspHong Kong clamps down\u0026nbspHong Kong is to impose a mandatory two-week quarantine on all people coming over from mainland China.\u0026nbspIt will also close two terminals where cruise ships dock as it seeks to halt the spread of coronavirus.\u0026nbspThe city has already clamped down on border crossings and has seen 21 infections so far.\u0026nbspMedical staff went on strike for a second day, demanding full closure of the border with China.\u0027Keep fighting\u0027\u0026nbspKeep fighting is the message from a Thai taxi driver who recovered from coronavirus, after catching it from Chinese tourists.\u0026nbspEven I can beat it. So can you, the driver told people in Wuhan as he was discharged from hospital.\u0026nbspI watched the news every day from my quarantine room and send my support to Wuhan.\u0026nbspThe unnamed cabbie added:\u0026nbspWhen I found out I had the virus, I cried because I have to take care of my family. But I don\u0027t have a bad feeling against tourists or the Chinese. I drive a taxi, tourists are my breadbasket.Tech hit\u0026nbspFoxconn, the huge Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, has said it intends to gradually begin working its factories in China back up to speed next week, Reuters reports citing an anonymous source.\u0026nbspHowever, full production capacity is apparently not expected until late in February.\u0026nbspFoxconn makes iPhones, among other popular tech. The coronavirus effect is likely to dent its 2020 profits.Beijing admits failings\u0026nbspChina’s leadership has\u0026nbspfinally admitted what doctors and international health experts have been warning for some time - that there were “shortcomings and deficiencies” in its emergency response to the novel coronavirus outbreak,\u0026nbspwrites\u0026nbspAdam Withnall.\u0026nbspPresident Xi Jinping, chairing a second meeting of the top decision-making Politburo Standing Committee since the outbreak began, said China faced a “race against the clock” to stem the tide of new infections.\u0026nbspRecoveries\u0026nbspIt remains the case that far more people have recovered from coronavirus than have died. The tally stands at 942\u0026nbsprecoveries against 493 deaths, according to a tracker run by the elite John Hopkins University.New Hong Kong total\u0026nbspThere are 21 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hong Kong, the city\u0027s leader Carrie Lam has said.Malaysian infections\u0026nbspTwo Malaysian citizens flown back from Wuhan have tested positive for coronavirus, the nation says. Twelve people there are now infected.\u0026nbspMalaysia sent a flight to Wuhan on Monday to bring back more than 100 of its citizens who were stranded.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they were scrambling, too, to explain how one of the most closely-watched moments in the lead-up to the election could have gone so dramatically wrong.The plan was that caucus organisers would be able to use the app to send in their results, allowing the state party to easily collate them from those submissions. It is the first time that such a system has been used in the Iowa caucus.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

That plan was pulled with just two weeks to go, the paper reported.Very quickly, users started reporting glitches and errors, and organisers were able to input the information as intended. Many complained that they were being shown error messages and that the app would not load properly, forcing them to call in rather than use the app as planned.The Iowa caucus fiasco is a metaphor for the state of US democracyJonathan Green, who chaired a precinct in Lone Tree, said that when he tried to put the results into the reporting app, he kept getting a confusing error message: “Unknown protocol. The address specifies a protocol (e.g., “wxyz:??”.) the browser does not\u0026nbsprecognise, so the browser cannot properly connect to the site.”The backup plan of having people call in their results also ran into trouble because the phones they had been asked to use in case of problems were not being answered, according to Des Moines County Democratic Chair Tom Courtney.Issues were further exacerbated by the fact that the app was only made available at a later stage, in an attempt to stop outside interference. That meant it had not been fully tested, and that organisers had little experience of it before the caucuses.Officials have stressed that the delays and problems are not the result of a hack or intrusion, and that the results will remain safe despite the problems.“We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results,” the party said in a statement. “This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.”The creation of the app still remains mired in some mystery: very little is known about the process of its creation, or where it came from. Though it is reported to have been made by a company called “Shadow”, the exact details of that startup are still unclear.In fact, many of the organisations – such as nonprofit Acronym, which was reported to be an investor – have actually distanced themselves from the creation of the app in the wake of the mess.All of the information is also kept in paper backups, and officials can now scour through those to find less high-tech but more reliable results for who has won. Local Democratic officials have claimed that means that the result will still arrive as normal, and will be reliable when it does, with the problems only meaning that they will take longer to actually report.But the fallout could have broader implications beyond Iowa – into the rest of the primaries and caucuses, and even into further elections. As well as further scrutiny of the app, it could lead to yet more questions about why Iowa gets to be the first state in the country to declare, and whether that privilege should go to somewhere else in the wake of such high-profile mistakes.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s bugged me ever since and I’ve always wanted to apologise to you. It wasn’t cool of me to do that to you.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe study sets out: Our results demonstrate that ecstatic display songs of the African penguin follow Zipf\u0027s Law of Brevity and the Menzerath-Altmann Law.This is the first compelling evidence for conformity to linguistic laws in vocal sequences of a non-primate species.As predicted, we found that the duration of the syllables was inversely correlated with the frequency of occurrence.The authors add: We suggest that relationships between element duration, frequency of use and song size are mainly a consequence of vocal production constraints interacting with selective pressures for intersexual mate choice and territorial defence in dense colonies.Importantly, our results suggest for the first time that information compression can coexist with other sources of selection in a non-primate species with a small and relatively fixed vocal system.Additional reporting by PA.university of torino\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Luckily her new job allowed her to cut her hours and work from home to make the situation work for her.But she hopes the DWP will shake-up the system for it to help others in future get back into work.A DWP spokesperson said: We cannot comment on an ongoing case."},{"url":null,"title":"sir keir starmer voters humble beginnings","story":"But the frontrunner to seize the Labour crown has certainly moved a very long way from his humble origins.Apart from being a knight of the realm, the posh Trot has pocketed almost £, for providing legal advice since he became an MP five years ago — working out at an eyewatering £ an hour.This is on top of his generous salary for his day job of nearly £, a year, a combined income far beyond the dreams of ordinary voters.His Momentum buddies might also question the legal company he keeps.Several law firms who defend businessmen in bribery, corruption or fraud cases have paid him handsomely.Shockingly, one that he worked for before he was an MP represented ­terror suspects including Abu Qatada.The leading anti-Brexiteer, who lives in a swanky North London house worth £.million, even earned thousands of pounds as an advisor while Gibraltar tried to nobble Brexit.Sir Kier may be the bookie’s favourite to become the next Labour leader.But down-to-earth voters will never buy his “man of the people” pose.The BBC’s inherent liberal bias is never far from the surface.So it is unsurprising that the Corporation couldn’t resist a swipe at Brexit hours before we left the EU.It’s disgraceful the Beeb sought to mock Britain in a film aimed at kids. Anti-Brexit comedian Nish Kumar hosted the Horrible Histories “special” song on CBBC, branded on Twitter as “British things . . . turns out there’s hardly any”.Its desperately unfunny attempt to present a “woke“ version of history by sending up the Royal Family while highlighting the slave trade was little more than thinly-veiled propaganda.It is grotesque that children should be subjected to such brainwashing.BRITS stranded in snake flu-ridden China have been going through hell.So it’s bizarre that our man in Wuhan had flown back home just as the deadly epidemic swept through the area.Consul Gareth Hoar apparently boarded a plane hours before the city went into lockdown when it should have been blindingly obvious that an emergency was developing.So which bungler thought it was a good idea to let the consul come home before stranded Britons Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexit parties were held from Cornwall to Cumbria.Parliament Square was awash with Union Jacks as Nigel Farage had a beano that he had been planning for  years, chucking a metaphorical milkshake over everyone who ever dissed him.But this was not VE Day.Where Brexit was celebrated, the mood was one of patriotic pride rather than euphoria unbound.This was a very British departure — respectful, self-effacing and anxious not to cause offence.We refrained from sticking up two fingers. We were scrupulously polite.The UK started le outside the EU with no Big Ben ringing the chimes of freedom, no firework display setting the post-Brexit sky ablaze, no laser show on the white clfs of Dover.The big moment came at pm rather than midnight — the UK, now as always, a little out of step with our continental cousins in Brussels — so it did not even feel like New Year’s Eve.By midnight — already am in sleepy old Brussels — the party was winding down.As we left the EU, Downing Street lit up with red, white and blue lasers and an image of Big Ben, complete with a recording of the bongs.But the door of  Downing Street stayed firmly shut as the Prime Minister hosted a private party for staff.For all the nation knew, Boris could have been having an early night with Carrie and Dilyn the dog.Downing Street was as deserted as the Marie Celeste.Here was the strangest thing about Friday night — the total absence of Boris Johnson.The PM had recorded a speech full of optimistic talk about making Brexit a “storming success” and bringing the nation back together.But the BBC and ITV both refused to broadcast the speech, as Downing Street aides had refused to let them film it.Soyou wanted to see what the British Prime Minister said about this truly momentous moment in British history, you could not have seen it on our state broadcaster’s channels. UNBELIEVABLE.The BBC news studio was bathed in Brussels blue, asin mourning — so censoring Boris felt small-minded, ­churlish and petty beyond belief.I strongly suspect that ­refusing to broadcast Boris’s big Brexit-night speech will turn out to be the beginning of the end for the licence fee.If the BBC cannot look like a state broadcaster on a night of historic national importance, then it never will.But we didn’t need the Beeb to tell us that this was history happening before our eyes.The biggest mandate for anything in British history had FINALLY been honoured. Democracy had triumphed.After more than  years inside the European federalist experiment, the British people were masters of their own destiny once more. And while the national mood on Friday night was respectful for the feelings of the losers, perhaps that was because there is no need for ­triumphalism when you know you have won.The clock struck pm and Leavers and Remainers were all suddenly extinct.All those eye-swivelling nutjobs threatening to shove a Brexit p coin up their pious rectums in protest no longer seemed like a threat to ­democracy.They seemed worthy of pity.But after all the toxic ­isions of the past four years, the wounds will not heal quickly.The most vicious insult thrown at those of us who dared to vote to leave the EU was that we would all soon be dead. And so it is a bitter irony to reflect that Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine, John Major, Lord Adonis, Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and all the rest will never live long enough to drag us back into the European Union.At long last, Brexit’s uncivil war is done.And why Because the roots of British democracy run deep.Once we had voted to leave, it was ultimately unthinkable that we would ever remain — despite the fervent wishes of almost the entire British establishment, from the House of Lords and House of Commons to the civil service, the BBC and big business.Once the people had spoken, in the end they had to be obeyed.No parliamentary paralysis could ever stop Brexit. No clever lawyers could thwart it forever.That historic moment on Friday night felt it had an historic inevitability about it.British democracy could not be denied. How did the arrogant, out-of-touch establishment ever imagine they could overrule the largest vote for anything in our history So au revoir, monsieur, and adios, senor and bye-bye, mein liebe herr. Except — we are not leaving Europe, are we We are only leaving the European Union — that unloved, corrupt, expansionist empire.And the British people have nothing but love in their souls for Europe.Here’s the great Brexit irony. The British are probably the most pro-European nation on the continent. We revere European culture, drink their wine, holiday at their beaches, cities and moun-tains, eat their fruit, vegetables and cheese and buy their cars.But the British have always been a lousy fit in the EU.We do not like having leaders who we cannot kick out.We do not enjoy unelected old geezers in foreign cities telling us who can and can’t come into our country.We — one of the oldest democracies in the world, a country that has not been invaded for , years — truly do not need anyone  to make our laws or to tell us what justice looks like.The EU just lost its second-largest contributor while the largest contributor — Germany — teeters on the edge of recession.We should try to be understandingthey sound bitter.Our stormy relationship with the EU has lasted all my adult le.The first time I ever voted was in the  referendum, when I girded my flared jeans and enthusiastically voted “Yes to Europe”.But like my nation, over the course of the decades I fell out of love with the EU.Like my nation, I began to feel that I had been lied to about what the project really meant.Like my nation — and around .million of my countrymen in  — the thought of “ever greater union” made my skin crawl. For I believed with all my heart and soul that my great nation’s identity is worth preserving.Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, sneers that the UK must “come to terms with the fact that it is now a small country”.Leo’s line is that the UK is now an isolated little rain-lashed rock, cowering timidly off the coast of the mighty European Union empire.But it doesn’t feel like we are a small nation today.It feels like we are a global nation once again, open for business with the world.It feels like we are the world’s sixth-largest economy, a cultural superpower, a warrior nation with a nuclear deterrent and the best armed forces in the world, the oldest parliamentary democracy on the planet and the longest-reigning monarch in history.All of that, plus the new added ingredient of post-Brexit va-va-voom.And in a Europe blighted by fragile coalitions and leaders with feet of blancmange, the UK boasts a popular Prime Minister presiding over the strongest, most stable government in Europe.British democracy has a far longer history than the European Union.If we were a small nation, then we would never have had the guts to leave the EU.If we were a small nation, then after the EU referendum of , we would have done what all those other EU countries did when they came up with a referendum result that Brussels didn’t like.We would have voted again, until Michel Barnier put down his cane.But the UK was always dferent.Unlike so many of our neighbours, we have not known the terror of fascism and communism, we have never experienced the jackboots of an invading army on our land, we have never seen our country chopped up by cruel foreign conquerors.We are a small nation in size but, through the centuries, we have always proved too big to bully.And what now The extremist voices — on both sides of the Brexit debate — will fade away because extremism is never the British way.Even with a year of transition and haggling about trade ahead, Brexit feels like it is slipping into the history books.The EU referendum in the summer of  seems long ago now.But as I recall, all we ever wanted was for our country to be a self-governing, sovereign nation once more and to restore the freedoms bought with the sacrice of the generations who came before us.Big Ben was silent on Friday night, but did you hear the church bells ring in all the faraway towns That is the sound of a country that just got its mojo back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were naive.After promising to consider a Canada-style free trade agreement with the UK as part of the WithdrawalAgreement, EU officials are already shamelessly back-pedalling. To secure a deal, they now say we must follow all the bloc’s regulatory rules.They must have known Boris Johnson would never agree to this bizarre bid. Aligning with Europe on everything would entirely defeat the point of Brexit.But they hoped that by showing some muscle, they could make the PM quake with fear and give them the upper hand.It was a woeful miscalculation.Unlike his predecessor, Mr Johnson believes in the UK whole-heartedly. And he has no qualms about telling bullies where to stick it.Brussels had better up its game: independent Britain is a force to be reckoned with.DOES the BBC have a death wish The latest Horrible Histories “comedy” video kicks sand in the faces of ordinary, patriotic Brits.Its warped version of history misses out Britain winning two world wars, a World Cup, dominating global music charts for decades, and creating many of the greatest TV shows of all time.Why  Because for the ultra-liberal BBC, Britain bashing has become a sport.We’ve always felt a certain affection for our state broadcaster.

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The companies also kept £million from the dference in petrol costs and prices.That totals £million fleeced from drivers between December  and the end of January.The FairFuel UK campaign said the research exposed the desperate need for an independent fuel pricing watchdog to ensure falling wholesale costs are passed on to drivers.Before the election ministers said they were considering a proposal to create a new PumpWatch regulator.FairFuel UK founder Howard Cox said: “Characteristically, greedy fuel supply chain businesses have chosen to stuff their wallets at the expense of hard pressed drivers.“This is why Boris’s government must implement an independent fuel pricing watchdog as a matter of urgency, to stop the habitual ripping off of motorists every time they fill up.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because very often it sure as hell ain’t the product.Last Saturday, the most read piece on the BBC news homepage was a clickbait “story” — taken from Twitter — about how Kim Kardashian eats chicken nuggets.Yes, you read that right. With £.billion of your money to its name, one of the most popular “stories” on the BBC’s news website was an item which didn’t cost a penny to make, wasn’t news and stretched the definition of “public service” far beyond breaking point. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.James Purnell — a particularly puffed-up BBC exec — announced  months ago that he and his Radio  Education team would be expanding into podcasts. He stayed horribly true to his word.In , Auntie produces podcasts on everything from football and Love Island to what Towie star Gemma ­Collins’ latest musings are, which — thanks to the big names at the helm — are ­raking in listeners.For Purnell, this is something to be celebrated. Successful podcasts presumably mean more money in his already overstuffed pockets.But for the hundreds of private podcast makers out there, it spells the beginning of the end. Competing with a company which uses public funds to net the likes of Peter Crouch is nigh-on impossible.How, I ask you, can a state broadcaster justy putting hard-working private firms out of business Yes, Ollie Williams discussing his shock exit from the Love Island villamight be entertaining, but what ­“service” is it providing the public Can the BBC — which doesn’t make Love Island — really do a better job of a Love Island podcast than ITV, which does You’d think the BBC top dogs, who are desperate to cling on to the Royal Charter, would be asking these vital questions too.But in their desperate quest for “yoof” audiences, they’ve chucked their critical faculties out of the window.And it’s all for nothing. Because the quest is a wild goose chase. According to the latest Ofcom report, most kids don’t watch ANY linear TV.So the BBC is defending a dying, analogue means of ­communication. But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future.

There was a twist to the end of tonightaposs BBC expose of the Tory regime, as front of house Job Centre worker Karen is shown stacking shelves at a local pound store. After clocking off from her eight-hour sht, during which she greets hundreds of people who come through the door every day, Karen heads to the store where she works an extra  hours a week in order for her to survive on low-wages in the capital. She tells the cameras: You want to be able to succeed and do better in le but it just seems that year after year it gets harder. Iaposm doing what society says you should do, get up in the morning, go to work, be part of society and Iaposm doing that and Iaposm still having financial issues. I pay my bills, and thataposs it, I canapost do anything . Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror Even the cost of food, is so expensive, come the end of the month, weaposre eating things like beans on toast to get you to the next payday. And Karen, a civil servant for  years and one of the longest-serving members of staff in Peckham Job Centre, says those working to implement Universal Credit are going through the same issues as those of the hundreds of people who walk through the door. She said: You have people working delivering Universal Credit and claiming Universal Credit.  You can give words of encouragement and you can empathise with your claimants, but most of the time you are going through a lot of the same things - the same issues, personal things - as they have. What we are all doing is going from pay cheque to pay cheque. Kare is seen in the show to become frustrated with protesters outside the Peckham Job Centre branch at which she works - even placing her backside against the window in defiance.  It doesnapost bother me when they are there, Iaposm a trade unionist, everyone has the right to protest, it just bothers me that their facts arenapost up to date, itaposs all negative, said Karen.  Part of a team of  front of house staff who greet people as they come into the Job Centre, Karen tells the cameras she is tired.  She is shown trying to issue a foodbank voucher for someone who lives outside of Southwark.She said: Thataposs what makes our job dficult, weaposre trying to get them into work but we also have to deal with the outside problem that theyaposve got going on, so we have to clear those problems before they can get into work. And the experienced civil servant gave an insight into how the system prevents her from helping those most in need. She said: The anger is sometimes hard to deal with. I just have to remind myself the anger might be directed at me but itaposs not about me, itaposs about a system. It just feels like you are not doing enough. You feel like you are just pushing against the tide.There are ways in which you can understand a lot of customeraposs point of view, where they are coming from, their communities, because I come from those communities and the things that go on that the Government just does not understand how it impacts on their lives and what they have to deal with. And I know the processes donapost allow me to tackle those issues because of the processes we have in place You want to say that I do care and I do want to help you, but this is as much as I can do, this is the law.  Elsewhere in the show, a homeless former pub landlord slammed Universal Credit as the worst thing in the world as he struggled to rebuild his le under an embarrassing regime which leaves you one pay cheque away from the gutter. NHS worker Rachel was left penniless when she was gave up work and faced a five-week benefit wait.And it was revealed that the rollout of the Toriesapos hated Universal Credit benefits shake-up has been delayed yet again - until .  Lisa Nandy, MP for Wigan and Labour leadership candidate said tonight: “For too long the benefits system has been designed from the top-down and the Tories have shown little regard for the brutal reality facing those who need it.Too many people end up destitute and in despair at the hands of a system that is supposed to help them. Universal Credit should be scrapped and rebuilt with the people it should be supporting."},{"url":null,"title":"labour cannot rely voters flocking","story":"w.mantis  Why Labour cannot rely on voters flocking back once Jeremy Corbyn is gone n Labour leadership candidates take part in the Mirrors hustings on Sunday, setting out their plans to revive the party.

But it has not always been that way.  nIn ,  white families here launched a protest over the choice of primary school for their children.  nThey wanted to send their kids to a school where most of the pupils were white.  nBut the youngsters were allocated to a school where nearly % of children were Asian, prompting the row.  nThen two years later there was a small riot between BNP supporters and local Asians.  nIn , Mohammad Sidique Khan, the ringleader of the July  bombers who killed  people on Londonaposs transport network, plotted the attack from his home in Dewsbury.  nAnd the UKaposs youngest suicide bomber, -year-old Talha Asma, who blew himself up in Syria in , came from the town.  nBut civic leaders in this smart, proud constituency with its -year-old Victoria town hall made of local Ashlar stone have worked hard to integrate communities and heal isions.  nStatistics show Kirklees – the council covering Dewsbury – had an unemployment rate of .% from October  to September , in line with the national average.  nThe town centre seems quiet for a midweek afternoon as shoppers walk past boarded-up and shuttered stores including Poundland, Moneypennyaposs Money Shop and High Street Bargains.  n  n nDewsbury Market only opens four days a week and, like many towns, it has its fair share of bookies, nail bars and charity shops, including Age UK and the British Heart Foundation stores.  nWhile MPsapos majorities in Dewsbury are never big – even in Tony Blairaposs  landslide triumph the party won the seat by , votes – Labour must win here to be in government.  nMs Sherrf feared she would lose throughout the campaign, and as the pm exit poll dropped she knew the game was up.  n“When we were out door knocking people you always perceived to be Labour no matter what, who regardless of whataposs going on, say, aposIaposm Labour through and throughapos – this time that just seemed to go out the window,” she said.  n  n   n“We had days where it was just awful.”  nShe recalled an incident which pointed to impending defeat.  n“I remember a freezing Saturday knocking on three houses and meeting three ex-miners consecutively who were voting for Boris Johnson,” she said.  n“The Tory message was really effective.  n“Like aposTake Back Controlapos, they were saying aposGet Brexit Doneapos – people were parroting it to me on the door.  n“That was a real low.”  nAnother encounter proved prophetic, when a woman told her: “I have voted Labour all my le but I am voting Conservative for Brexit, and everybody round here is doing the same.”  nMs Sherrf believed voters were “tired of what they saw as the preication and procrastination” over the UKaposs departure, and the Tory slogan “appealed to everybody”.  nShe also tore into Labouraposs “shocking” manesto.  n“It seemed to be all over the place. There were some great policies but unfortunately some of them were drowned out,” she said.  n“There wasnapost anything I fundamentally disagreed with, and I absolutely get what we were trying to say, but we didnapost articulate it right.  n“It looked like a shopping list.”  nLabouraposs organisation was “a mess”, with activists sent to seats the party had little hope of winning rather than defending constituencies it held, she said.  nOptimists look at Britainaposs EU departure last Friday and Mr Corbynaposs looming exit as leader as reasons to be confident of a revival.  n n  n nBut Ms Sherrf warned: “It will get easier but itaposs not a panacea.  n“For some people they voted Tory with a heavy heart.  n“But you know when you hold your nose and do something for the first time it can be hideous  The second time itaposs easier.  n“My worry is how we get them back now theyaposre gone.  n“We canapost be complacent, we canapost just assume that with Brexit aposdoneapos and with Jeremy Corbyn gone that suddenly all these people are going to flock back.  n“Some people are lost for good.  n“I feel like we have let people down, I really do.”  nShe added: “We need to remember that to win elections we need to convince people who didnapost vote for us last time to vote for us this time.  n“I know that sounds really obvious but I think some people have forgotten that.  n“We also need to look at why we are perceived to be unpatriotic and soft on crime.  n“We need to be credible.”  nVoters in Dewsbury today revealed why Labour lost the seat seven weeks ago.  nMargaret Wright, , a retired bakery shop worker, said: “Iaposve voted Conservative recently, though I voted Labour when I was younger.  n n  n   n n“I didnapost think much of Jeremy Corbyn, he didnapost do anything for me.  n“I voted Out in the referendum – I think weaposre better off doing things for ourselves – and the Conservatives have delivered Brexit.”  nWarehouse worker Mohammed Shabir, , was a lelong Labour voter but did not vote for anyone in December.  nMohammed, who came to the UK from Pakistan  years ago, believed there was little dference between politicians.  n“They all s*** in the same pot,” he said.  n  n   n n“We only see them once every four years, we donapost see anybody in between.  n“Iaposve got no opinion on Jeremy Corbyn, I donapost know him so I canapost comment on what I read in the papers or people say about him – same as Boris Johnson.  n“Letaposs seehe can do what he promises.”  nFormer soldier Murray McCarthy, , who served in the Duke of Wellingtonaposs Regiment, voted Tory.  nHe said: “There wasnapost much choice – Labour was shambolic, they didnapost seem to be able to string anything together.  n  n   n“I was pleased with the result of the Brexit referendum, and I voted to Leave.”  nJanet Hardaker, , a retried British Telecom secretary, also backed the Tories.  nShe said: “I voted Conservative the last two times because I couldnapost stand Jeremy Corbyn, heaposs too anti-Semitic and too pro-immigration.  n  n   n   n“I just donapost think he would have got Brexit done.  n“I voted to come Out and I wanted it sorted.  n“Yes Boris is daft but I think heaposs OK, actually. He will get it sorted.”  nShe was unsureshe would back Labour again.  n“I would have to see whataposs happening over the next  years with Labour because they have just gone to pot,” she said.  n“It would be  years before I even think about it.”  nPet shop volunteer Chaz Ward turned  just eight days after the election, so was unable to vote.  n n  nButshe had been old enough she would have backed Labour.  nShe said: “They were aimed more at the younger side of things.  n“Honestly, I think Jeremy Corbyn was a better option because I think Boris is a bit too immature – he hid in a fridge at one point during the campaign.  n“He didnapost take things as seriously as Jeremy Corbyn.  n“If Labour continues to aim more at what the younger generation want then it will be a good thing and I would probably vote Labour.  n“Itaposs more about the world we are going to grow up into rather than the older generation.”  nShe added: “I donapost like Brexit, there was no reason for it, we were fine as things were.”  nBut she did not back ato the EU.  n“Itaposs done now, thereaposs no point in trying to put it back together. Whataposs done is done.”  n* The Mirror is hosting the Labour leadership and deputy leadership hustings on Sunday.

There were some great policies but unfortunately some of them were drowned out,” she said. n“There wasnt anything I fundamentally disagreed with, and I absolutely get what we were trying to say, but we didnt articulate it right. n“It looked like a shopping list.” nLabours organisation was “a mess”, with activists sent to seats the party had little hope of winning rather than defending constituencies it held, she said. nOptimists look at Britains EU departure last Friday and Mr Corbyns looming exit as leader as reasons to be confident of a revival. nBut Ms Sherrf warned: “It will get easier but its not a panacea. n“For some people they voted Tory with a heavy heart. n“But you know when you hold your nose and do something for the first time it can be hideous  The second time its easier. n“My worry is how we get them back now theyre gone. n“We cant be complacent, we cant just assume that with Brexit done and with Jeremy Corbyn gone that suddenly all these people are going to flock back. n“Some people are lost for good. n“I feel like we have let people down, I really do.” nShe added: “We need to remember that to win elections we need to convince people who didnt vote for us last time to vote for us this time. n“I know that sounds really obvious but I think some people have forgotten that. n“We also need to look at why we are perceived to be unpatriotic and soft on crime. n“We need to be credible.” nVoters in Dewsbury today revealed why Labour lost the seat seven weeks ago. nMargaret Wright, , a retired bakery shop worker, said: “Ive voted Conservative recently, though I voted Labour when I was younger. n“I didnt think much of Jeremy Corbyn, he didnt do anything for me. n“I voted Out in the referendum – I think were better off doing things for ourselves – and the Conservatives have delivered Brexit.” nWarehouse worker Mohammed Shabir, , was a lelong Labour voter but did not vote for anyone in December. nMohammed, who came to the UK from Pakistan  years ago, believed there was little dference between politicians. n“They all s*** in the same pot,” he said. n“We only see them once every four years, we dont see anybody in between. n“Ive got no opinion on Jeremy Corbyn, I dont know him so I cant comment on what I read in the papers or people say about him – same as Boris Johnson. n“Lets seehe can do what he promises.” nFormer soldier Murray McCarthy, , who served in the Duke of Wellingtons Regiment, voted Tory. nHe said: “There wasnt much choice – Labour was shambolic, they didnt seem to be able to string anything together. n“I was pleased with the result of the Brexit referendum, and I voted to Leave.” nJanet Hardaker, , a retried British Telecom secretary, also backed the Tories. nShe said: “I voted Conservative the last two times because I couldnt stand Jeremy Corbyn, hes too anti-Semitic and too pro-immigration. n“I just dont think he would have got Brexit done. n“I voted to come Out and I wanted it sorted. n“Yes Boris is daft but I think hes OK, actually. He will get it sorted.” nShe was unsureshe would back Labour again. n“I would have to see whats happening over the next  years with Labour because they have just gone to pot,” she said. n“It would be  years before I even think about it.” nPet shop volunteer Chaz Ward turned  just eight days after the election, so was unable to vote. nButshe had been old enough she would have backed Labour. nShe said: “They were aimed more at the younger side of things. n“Honestly, I think Jeremy Corbyn was a better option because I think Boris is a bit too immature – he hid in a fridge at one point during the campaign. n“He didnt take things as seriously as Jeremy Corbyn. n“If Labour continues to aim more at what the younger generation want then it will be a good thing and I would probably vote Labour. n“Its more about the world we are going to grow up into rather than the older generation.” nShe added: “I dont like Brexit, there was no reason for it, we were fine as things were.” nBut she did not back ato the EU. n“Its done now, theres no point in trying to put it back together. Whats done is done.” n* The Mirror is hosting the Labour leadership and deputy leadership hustings on Sunday.

Even under Margaret Thatcher they only claimed the constituency in the  landslide. The Conservativesapos only other success here was in  when Simon Reevell ousted Labouraposs Shahid Malik.That was until December when, as Boris Johnson ploughed through Labouraposs Red Wall of northern and Midlandsapos heartlands, Mark Eastwood became the third Tory MP for Dewsbury.For Labouraposs Paula Sherrf, who won the seat back for Labour in  with a , majority and held it two years later by doubling her advantage to ,, the defeat was personal. Weeks earlier, she clashed bitterly with the Prime Minister on a febrile night in the Commons.  Twenty-four hours previously, the Governmentaposs prorogation of Parliament was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. In an unplanned question to the PM, she urged him to tone down his language of “surrender” and “betrayal” over delays to the UKaposs EU withdrawal. She highlighted rape threats and death threats issued to women MPs, and reminded him of the murder of her friend and neighbouring Labour MP Jo Cox in . But Mr Johnson dismissed her pleas as “humbug” - triggering uproar in the chamber. Speaking in Dewsbury today, Ms Sherrf said: “I hadnapost intended to speak – I hadnapost even combed my hair or put lipstick on. “If I had known I was going to make such an infamous intervention I would at least have put my lippy on. “He was whipping up a storm and I thought it was irresponsible to talk in those terms. “When he said aposhumbugapos I was furious, incandescent.” Confirming her fears about language, pro-Brexit voters echoed the PMaposs words of surrender and betrayal, “all the time”, she said, during the election campaign in a seat where people voted % to % to Leave. Ms Sherrf insisted today: “Nobody loves their country more than me, you donapost get more patriotic than me.” Accusations Labour was unpatriotic particularly hurt.  Her father served  years as a Royal Navy submariner and her grandfather was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal during the Second World War. But, like voters where across the Red Wall, people cited the Labour leaderaposs perceived lack of patriotism as a reason they could not back the party.“Undoubtedly Jeremy Corbyn was a huge issue round here,” she admitted.“It pains me but people were parroting stuff from the papers – aposheaposs a terrorist sympathiserapos and aposheaposs more loyal to the Russians than he is to this countryapos. “He came up as much as Brexit, I canapost deny it.”Patriotism has been a major issue in the former mill town, which has previously suffered from racial tension between the white and Asian populations. Today, about three quarters of Kirkleesapos population was white British in , with % Asian British Pakistani and % Asian British Indian. Mainly, they get along. But it has not always been that way. In ,  white families here launched a protest over the choice of primary school for their children. They wanted to send their kids to a school where most of the pupils were white. But the youngsters were allocated to a school where nearly % of children were Asian, prompting the row. Then two years later there was a small riot between BNP supporters and local Asians. In , Mohammad Sidique Khan, the ringleader of the July  bombers who killed  people on Londonaposs transport network, plotted the attack from his home in Dewsbury. And the UKaposs youngest suicide bomber, -year-old Talha Asma, who blew himself up in Syria in , came from the town. But civic leaders in this smart, proud constituency with its -year-old Victoria town hall made of local Ashlar stone have worked hard to integrate communities and heal isions. Statistics show Kirklees – the council covering Dewsbury – had an unemployment rate of .% from October  to September , in line with the national average. The town centre seems quiet for a midweek afternoon as shoppers walk past boarded-up and shuttered stores including Poundland, Moneypennyaposs Money Shop and High Street Bargains.  Dewsbury Market only opens four days a week and, like many towns, it has its fair share of bookies, nail bars and charity shops, including Age UK and the British Heart Foundation stores. While MPsapos majorities in Dewsbury are never big – even in Tony Blairaposs  landslide triumph the party won the seat by , votes – Labour must win here to be in government. Ms Sherrf feared she would lose throughout the campaign, and as the pm exit poll dropped she knew the game was up. “When we were out door knocking people you always perceived to be Labour no matter what, who regardless of whataposs going on, say, aposIaposm Labour through and throughapos – this time that just seemed to go out the window,” she said.  “We had days where it was just awful.” She recalled an incident which pointed to impending defeat. “I remember a freezing Saturday knocking on three houses and meeting three ex-miners consecutively who were voting for Boris Johnson,” she said. “The Tory message was really effective. “Like aposTake Back Controlapos, they were saying aposGet Brexit Doneapos – people were parroting it to me on the door. “That was a real low.” Another encounter proved prophetic, when a woman told her: “I have voted Labour all my le but I am voting Conservative for Brexit, and everybody round here is doing the same.” Ms Sherrf believed voters were “tired of what they saw as the preication and procrastination” over the UKaposs departure, and the Tory slogan “appealed to everybody”. She also tore into Labouraposs “shocking” manesto. “It seemed to be all over the place. There were some great policies but unfortunately some of them were drowned out,” she said. “There wasnapost anything I fundamentally disagreed with, and I absolutely get what we were trying to say, but we didnapost articulate it right. “It looked like a shopping list.” Labouraposs organisation was “a mess”, with activists sent to seats the party had little hope of winning rather than defending constituencies it held, she said. Optimists look at Britainaposs EU departure last Friday and Mr Corbynaposs looming exit as leader as reasons to be confident of a revival.  But Ms Sherrf warned: “It will get easier but itaposs not a panacea. “For some people they voted Tory with a heavy heart. “But you know when you hold your nose and do something for the first time it can be hideous  The second time itaposs easier. “My worry is how we get them back now theyaposre gone. “We canapost be complacent, we canapost just assume that with Brexit aposdoneapos and with Jeremy Corbyn gone that suddenly all these people are going to flock back. “Some people are lost for good. “I feel like we have let people down, I really do.” She added: “We need to remember that to win elections we need to convince people who didnapost vote for us last time to vote for us this time. “I know that sounds really obvious but I think some people have forgotten that. “We also need to look at why we are perceived to be unpatriotic and soft on crime. “We need to be credible.” Voters in Dewsbury today revealed why Labour lost the seat seven weeks ago. Margaret Wright, , a retired bakery shop worker, said: “Iaposve voted Conservative recently, though I voted Labour when I was younger.  “I didnapost think much of Jeremy Corbyn, he didnapost do anything for me. “I voted Out in the referendum – I think weaposre better off doing things for ourselves – and the Conservatives have delivered Brexit.” Warehouse worker Mohammed Shabir, , was a lelong Labour voter but did not vote for anyone in December. Mohammed, who came to the UK from Pakistan  years ago, believed there was little dference between politicians. “They all s*** in the same pot,” he said.  “We only see them once every four years, we donapost see anybody in between. “Iaposve got no opinion on Jeremy Corbyn, I donapost know him so I canapost comment on what I read in the papers or people say about him – same as Boris Johnson. “Letaposs seehe can do what he promises.” Former soldier Murray McCarthy, , who served in the Duke of Wellingtonaposs Regiment, voted Tory. He said: “There wasnapost much choice – Labour was shambolic, they didnapost seem to be able to string anything together.  “I was pleased with the result of the Brexit referendum, and I voted to Leave.” Janet Hardaker, , a retried British Telecom secretary, also backed the Tories. She said: “I voted Conservative the last two times because I couldnapost stand Jeremy Corbyn, heaposs too anti-Semitic and too pro-immigration.  “I just donapost think he would have got Brexit done. “I voted to come Out and I wanted it sorted. “Yes Boris is daft but I think heaposs OK, actually. He will get it sorted.” She was unsureshe would back Labour again. “I would have to see whataposs happening over the next  years with Labour because they have just gone to pot,” she said. “It would be  years before I even think about it.” Pet shop volunteer Chaz Ward turned  just eight days after the election, so was unable to vote.

Tracy Brabin said she spoke out over the everyday sexism because she was standing up for women who get the same treatment around the world. And she said: You can’t take on the worldyou’re always worried about whether your hair’s right or not... listen to what we say, not what we wear. The -year-old politician - who took over from murdered MP Jo Cox - bared her right shoulder in a black formal dress while raising points of order with Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, , on Monday. But it was the former Coronation Street actressaposs choice of attire that attracted the attention of viewers, and she began fielding a string of insults on social media.  One Twitter user slammed the former Coronation Street actress as looking like a tart with another adding looks like sheaposs on the morning after a walk of shame.Another quipped: Is this really appropriate attire for parliament  @TracyBrabin #DressStandards. The Batley and Spen MP hit back tweeting: Hello. Sorry I donapost have time to reply to all of you commenting on this but I can confirm Iaposm not...A slag, Hungover. A tart. About to breastfeed. A slapper. Drunk. Just been banged over a wheelie bin. Who knew people could get so emotional over a shoulder... Today Ms Brabin appeared on BBC Breakfast to explain why she spoke out. She said: “I was startled by the vitriolic nature of [the comments].  It’s part of the territory as a politician. I am in privileged position that I can brush this off. But I feel that it’s my responsibility to call it out for women who don’t have that amplication. “Because there are women around the world that are putting up with this day in, day out, where they’re being demeaned for what they wear. “It’s another case of everyday sexism.” The Shadow Culture Secretary said her predecessor Tom Watson would never have been judged for his clothes because a woman is always judged more harshly than a man. Ms Brabin had been raising concerns over the governmentaposs crackdown on journalists - with the Mirror among outlets who were shut out of a No briefing- and the BBC, which could face decriminalisation of people who refuse to pay the licence fee. The MP said: There’s lots going on about the BBC and the future of the BBC and shoulders seem to take precedence. She added: “They are anonymous people often, keyboard warriors often sat in their mum’s back bedroom eating Pot Noodles having a pop at people they don’t know anything about.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA new law to stop parents paying rip-off school unorm fees has been backed by the Tory government.Tonightaposs announcement is a victory for parents and our sister paper the Sunday People- and suggests changes could become law as early as the next school year.The EducationBill would tell schools to stop relying on single suppliers for their unorms, unless the contract has gone out to tender. Labour MP Mike Amesbury claims this could end the monopoly of firms exclusively selling branded gear - at an average of £ a year for secondary schools and £ for primaries.His Private Memberaposs Bill looks set to put  guidance, which says schools must consider the cost of unorm changes and how often they happen, into law. Mr Amesbury told the Mirror the governmentaposs backing was absolutely brilliant. He added: It is a victory, though weaposre not quite there yet. We need to keep pushing to get it through Parliament. Schools Minister Nick Gibb announced his backing after meeting with Mr Amesbury about his Bill - which will be introduced to Parliament tomorrow and begin detailed debate next month. Private Memberaposs Bills usually have no hope of success unless theyaposre backed by the government. But confirming his backing, Mr Gibb said: School unorms should always be affordable and should not leave pupils or their families feeling that they cannot apply to a particular school. That is why we will be supporting the progress of this bill through Parliament, in order to make our guidance on the cost considerations for school unorm statutory at the earliest opportunity. With cross-party support including from Lib Dem Layla Moran, and Tories Huw Merriman and Kevin Hollinrake, the Bill is almost guaranteed to pass unless it is filibustered by a backbench MP. It comes after the Sunday People highlighted the plight of parents forced to fork out for branded school kit. Nearly one in six families said school unorm costs were to blame for them having to cut back on food and other basic essentials, compared with one in seven in . One pupil told the Childrenaposs Society: Some kids get to the point where they won’t even go in, they would just bunk that lesson rather than get in trouble for being in non-unorm. A parent added: I am not ashamed of being poor but I always want my children to look as well cared-for as others. I go without so my children can always have what is needed. The exact wording of the Bill - including how strict legal requirements on schools will be - is still being worked out. But Whitehall sources said it would be based on  guidance which was issued to schools by the government.

Nichaela explained that the staff at hospital have been fantastic and Forget Me Not have provided advice and visited Lorenzo in hospital. The couple hope to move Lorenzo to the Huddersfield-based Hospice when he is discharged from hospital, as a halfway house before eventually bringing him home.

Nabila Mughal-Martin was left devastated when six-year-old son Zach could not overcome an infection seven days after he beat the aggressive form of cancer. The mum, , said her little battler took on every challenge with a smile but his body had still not recovered from the fight when he was struck down with infection that proved too much.And the bright and happy schoolboy was robbed of his chance to ring his end of treatment bell, reports Derbyshire Live.The brave little superhero was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at age two and underwent three-and-a-half years of chemotherapy, which was due to finish last year. But two days before his birthday, in February , doctors revealed Zach had relapsed and another round of chemo put him in remission - though a bone marrow transplant was his only hope. A match could not be found in the family but Nabila said little Zach was given a leline when a donor was found resulting in four gruelling months in Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital. And joy at the resultant all-clear turned to heartbreak when the schoolboy contracted an infection and died just seven days later in August last year.

Mike McComb made his millions as a mobile phone entrepreneur before eventually selling his company to BT Cellnet in . And from his fortune, the businessman upgraded to a luxury property - featuring a grand, freestanding staircase, eight bedrooms, an astonishing  bathrooms and a gym. The mansion was built two years ago and has won awards for its design and creation. Mike, from Formby, Merseyside, will show off his mansion to presenter Adrian Chiles this Friday in new show, Our Coast. After telling Adrian Chiles he has nine children – seven of whom still live at his Firwood Hall home – the presenter asks him: “Are you Roman Catholic by any chance ” Mike replies: “I am, I am!”  Then, during a walk on Formby beach, Mike tells Adrian and Mehreen why the coastline means so much to him: “It’s memories for as long as I can remember. Nothing’s changed here, thankfully. It’s amazing – where you’d go as a schoolkid with a gang of mates, your bike and your butties.“I am just so proud to live here now, from riding up on your bike and spending your summer holidays here as a kid.”Mike, who was born in a two-up, two-down in Bootle, also has a place in Marbella, but asked which he likes best, tells Adrian: “It’s always great to come home and this is home.”, reports the Liverpool Echo.  The series will focus on four stretches of coastline around the Irish Sea – taking in parts of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – and the opening episode is a brilliant advert for the Mersey coast, and those who live and work on it. The series begins with Adrian climbing aboard Cunard’s Queen Mary  at the Pier Head, talking to some of its passengers and then witnessing the liner’s leaving of Liverpool – complete with Katumba band and firework display: “Liverpool has done the old girl proud here,” says Adrian, “What a send-off!” Viewers will also see historian Emma D’Abiri tell the famous story of the Viking ship thought to be buried under the car park at the front of The Railway pub on Birkenhead Road, Meols.

Er, have others  “Yes,” he admits. “A couple of people have fallen in. Fortunately, most of my friends aren’t really drinkers –they don’t drink so much they’re not going to fall in the pond.” This is the -year-old Phones u tycoon’s favourite room within the £million Mayfair residence he has recently re-furbished at a cost of £million. I am on a mind-boggling personal tour of his , sq ft, eight-floor, -bedroom, London home, complete with underground eight-stack car port, which is believed to be Britain’s most expensive house. And, even though there’s a gilded ballroom downstairs, this dining room is arguably the showstopper. How could it not be when, floating dreamily above the water, is a ft preserved tree trunk crowned with silk cherry blossom, and golden lizards are climbing the wall. Although interior designers, including Real Housewives star Dawn Ward, did most of the work, the river was John’s idea, as was the lava-inspired wall running theof the subterranean swimming pool and sauna .I was ready not to particularly take to the moneyman behind the opulence, but the fact that he calls the extravagant indoor stream a “pond” is a likeable sign that he hasn’t left his roots in Stoke-on-Trent. He tells me: “I grew up in a terrace, we took the metal bath off the wall outside, carried it in and put it by the fire, and I was allowed one kettle-full of water. “John then, wouldn’t have been able to comprehend this house in his wildest dreams.” My tour had not got off to the best of starts.Stepping into the palatial hall, I was informed it was a “no shoes house”. Which led to me standing before a billionaire beneath crystal chandeliers, with my big toes poking out of holes in my tights. Thankfully, he took pity on me, and the boots went back on. For four years, John’s -strong team has been doing up the s mansion, actually, two joined together, one of them once owned by the Sultan of Brunei’s brother. We begin in the ballroom, which holds  people and where the gold leaf alone cost £,.It was key to John buying this place. Since selling Phones u for £.billion in , John has been dedicated to philanthropy, fundraising for seriously ill and disabled children through his charity Caudwell Children, and for research into Lyme disease, which affects himself and his family. He has pledged to give % of his wealth away when he dies – although his five kids won’t be left too hard up. Today, he insists the prime use of this property is as a “lure” for A-list donors. He admits he is no Elton John, “who gets everyone to his ball”. He says: “Having a home like this that everyone on the planet wants to visit, even the rich, it’s an asset that helps. Princess Beatrice came one day to have a look and see me. “She walked in – and it really tickled me. She said, ‘Oh, my gosh I’ve never seen anything like it’. I chuckled and said, ‘No, of course you haven’t’.”John and his partner Modesta Vzesniauskaite, , a former Olympic cyclist from Lithuania, have relatively modest private quarters. He gives me a glimpse of a very white kitchen with two staff members lingering, and a lounge with plain sofas. Their quarters do open on to the river-filled dining room and the couple also have an “entertainment room” in the basement, with mirrored dancefloor, a bar, velvet booths, and a pair of gold, transgender nudes. He likes “thought-provoking” art and has a butterfly-covered AK- rle in the ballroom.

The ,kg haul was found in a dhow by Marine Commandos from Type  destroyer HMS Defender in the Indian Ocean. It comes just two months after the crew intercepted kg of crystal meth. Commander Richard Hewitt said: “Once again Defender has seized a signicant amount of narcotics. “This reinforces the Navy’s commitment to ensuring maritime security by disrupting the operations of smugglers and terrorists.” Armed Forces Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: Thanks to the work of HMS Defender and her crew, these drugs will never reach the street and the criminal organisations responsible will be dented financially. The substantial seizures made by the Combined Task Force are testament to the seamless co-operation between our international partners that keeps our citizens safe.

Many inland areas of the UK could experience gusts of up to mph, the Met Office said, while gales of between -mph could hit exposed coasts and hills, especially in the north and west. Heavy rain is also expected, forecasters said. Met Office chief meteorologist Neil Armstrong said: After a dry start to the week for many, with some sunny spells, early frosts and fog patches, the weather will become more unsettled as we head towards the weekend. This warning is expected to be updated as we get nearer to the weekend and confidence grows in the exact track and intensity of the weather system that is causing the wind and also bringing the potential for some heavy rain. Although still a long way off in forecast terms, there are signals the unsettled weather arriving this weekend could also continue into next week. Today, meanwhile, will be fine and dry for most with some good sunny spells and lighter winds and minimal fog patches.  And yesterday, the Met Office said it was too early to warn with any certainty of heavy snowfall later this month. Some forecasts last week predicted imminent snow but new analysis radars suggest this is no longer the case. Temperatures will, in fact, remain mild for the coming days, even peaking at C in places in the southwest on Friday, in a repeat of the latter stages of last month.  But this may prove to simply be the calm before the storm, before the monster gales run riot across the country on Saturday and Sunday. Speaking to , Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey said: It will get colder next week but it is too early to forecast whether thereaposll be snow or what temperatures we should expect.We can only say with a great deal of uncertainty what the  weather may be at this early stage.Polar maritime air moving in from the north will cause temperatures to fall. There is potential for some snow in parts of the north but thataposs not a certainty by any means.  Itaposll remain mild this week and on Saturday and Sunday potentially. Temperatures will be in double figures for most of the country before then, around  or C in places. There is potential for heavy rain though when it becomes windier. As we go through the next few days, it is likely the weather warning for wind will be refined or trimmed down somewhat as it is too early to tell where itaposll be at its worst at the moment unfortunately. There is potential for weather warnings for rain too. The unsettled pattern should remain for the rest of the month, forecasters add. The average temperature for the UK for February is C but most parts of the country have exceeded that each day so far this month, including Bournemouth which hit C on Monday.  UK  day weather forecast Today: A few fog patches around in the south this morning but otherwise a fine day for most with some good sunny spells and light winds. Windier and cloudier in the far north with some light rain, mainly for hills. Tonight: Cloudy in the far north with a little light rain for northwest Scotland and the Northern Isles. Cold with good clear spells where and fog patches, particularly in the south.

A culture of “avoidance and denial” that was uncovered by an inquiry will add to the misery of hundreds who suffered at his cruel hands. Fresh horrors may be discovered after the , patients he operated on at NHS and private hospitals in the West Midlands over  years are recalled for assessment. Paterson, serving a -year jail term for  counts of wounding with intent, is a disgrace to a noble profession whose mission is to save and enhance lives, not ruin them. Implementing in full the report into the scandal will, hopefully, stop another rogue surgeon running amok unchecked for a decade-and-a-half. As he sits in prison, Paterson should hang his head in shame. Dodgy motive Locking people up for refusing to pay a TV licence and fine seems unnecessarily heavy-handed. However we are right to question the motives behind a consultation over whether non-payment should stay a criminal offence.Rabid Tories are bashing the BBC because they feel it doesn’t broadcast enoughConservative Party propaganda and now under a cloak of fairness the sneaky party appears determined to undermine it. The Beeb fears a change could cost it £million.Blaming the BBC for a broken Tory promise to maintain free TV licences for all over-s, clearly isn’t enough for them.

An unnamed woman recently shared a hilariously honest five star review for a £.vibrator sold by Tracyaposs Dog on Amazon. Her y post detailed her initial scepticism of the item as well as her experience of using the product and was liked by thousands of potential shoppers causing the sex toy to sell-out. She wrote: Having read everyoneaposs reviews, I had high expectations, but with the price being under  dollars, I wasnapost exactly going to be shockedit was mediocre. A few friends of mine bought it recently and told me of its power. I was warned to take the day off, hydrate and above all do some stretches. I thought they were being such drama queens. However she soon discovered how wrong sheaposd been and how right they were. After the product arrived, she waited for her children to go to school, before plugging it in to charge. I plug this lil bad boy in. Waiting for it to charge, killing time reading some erotica my friend and fellow queenie, recommended, because I donapost have time to screw around waiting to aposget in the moodapos. I have to get the kids in a few hours and I need to be ready to go when this thing is done. Tik tok b**** welcome to motherhood, she continues.  Eventually a pink light began flashing, showing it was ready to go and she kicked off her solo party. I started on low, which I barely even felt, so me being me, I decided to go from zero to  in .. I hit the suction button setting to level five or six and hit the G-spot button as well. At least, I think thataposs what happened, because Iaposm pretty sure I blacked out. My legs went straight out like those goats who faint when scared. I frantically tried to turn it off, but ended up hitting the buttons like a maniac, sending even stronger suction. Iaposm pretty sure I levitated. It was an unending orgasm, she said. This time my soul left me, and god himself said aposchild, it is not your time, go back to the lil pink lightapos. I get up to clean up and realise in my seizure-like orgasms, I hurt my hip and back. Iaposm still hobbling four hours later. I did not stretch enough. She adds: So in conclusion, this met and exceeded expectations. Hydrate, make sure you donapost have to do anything that involves decisions or brainpower for the rest of the day and for the love of god, stretch like you are about to run the  metre dash.

Most women are forever grateful for the support, advice and help the offer - but that wasnapost the case for one bride who claims her oldest friend ruined her celebrations. The bride had asked her three best friends to be her bridesmaids two years ahead of her wedding and they were a big help when it came to the arrangements. But she claims one of them made everything very, very dficult on the wedding morning by making a special announcement of her own. Whilst itaposs basically tradition to start the celebrations early on the morning of the wedding with glasses of bubbly,  the bride noticed something was wrong when Laura - the biggest party animal of the group - turned down the alcohol. When the group questioned her, she came clean that she was pregnant. The bride said: Of course I was happy for her but obviously the focus was then on Laura and her pregnancy and not us getting ready for my wedding, something I had been planning for two years. Despite it not being the best start to the day, the bride brushed the announcement aside. She had made arrangements with the photographer for the her and her three bridesmaids to all stand together holding their bouquets in front of them, but it seemed that Laura had a better plan.  Instead of holding her bouquet, she stood cradling her bump - which the bride said wasnapost noticeable at just  weeks - and told the photographer: Oh it’s ok I’d prefer to stand like this”. With the brideaposs plan out the window, the photos ended up looking weird. When it was time for the speeches, sheaposd expected Laura to say a few nice words of congratulations - but she decided to share her happy news with a few more people. Although she didnapost make the entire speech about herself, she ended with: And I’m so excited to announce that as Bride’s best friend, I’d like her to be an honorary aunt to my baby who is due summer ! And being one of the brideaposs oldest and dearest friends, the entire wedding party was overjoyed at the news.  In nearly any other situation, sharing such an exciting announcement wouldnapost have been an issue, but the happy coupleaposs wedding had most definitely turned into a pregnancy reveal. The bride said: I felt so upset on my wedding day and haven’t really spoke to Laura much since. She has since sent me a text saying I’m acting like a spoiled brat and the world doesn’t revolve around me.The woman posted anonymously on Reddit asking fellow users whether she was being a bad friend by distancing herself after the disaster.One user replied: At first it seemed innocuous enough because you asked about her not drinking, but she spent the rest of the day deliberately drawing attention to her pregnancy and that’s rude af. You have every right to be upset. Another agreed: Talk about stealing the spotlight.

Shaun Byrne gave away the free-kick -yards out giving Nicky Cadden a look at goal. His effort took a deflection off the wall and Hazard could only palm the ball out, leaving McAlister with an easy finish.Seconds later Kalvin Orsi fired just over the bar as the home side had their tails up and the same player had the ball in the net from a superb overhead kick eight minutes before the break.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved. He is survived by his we, Anne, two daughters, mother, his two brothers and his two sisters.Irreplaceable but not forgotten in Lilliesleaf, Kelso and the Borders, William Graham Douglas, his father Bill, his grandfather, Willie, and his great grandfather, William.Ron Wilson"},{"url":null,"title":"alleged-stalker-remanded-custody","story":"A -year-old man has been remanded in custody at Jedburgh Sherf Court after being accused of stalking a former partner.Vincent Cardle - who gave an address in Roxburghshire - made no plea during a private hearing and the case was continued for further examination.Bail was refused and he was remanded in custody and is due to appear in court again later this week."},{"url":null,"title":"douglas-crawford-announced-2020s-melrosian-elect","story":"LEADING as this years Melrosian-elect,is -year-old Douglas Crawford.Douglas, who is currently studying a Masters degree in Performance Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, was revealed as the new Melrosian at the annual Ex-Melrosian Burns Supper last weekend.Douglas told us: \"Im really excited, Im looking forward to the summer now.\"It was a really good night, the speakers were fantastic, last years Melrosian, Ben, spoke well.\"I had a lot of family there so it was really special to be announced.\"Douglas will join other members of his family, including his father, who have taken up the role of Melrosian in the past, which he said makes the honour \"even more special.\"He added: \"I and my family are so grateful for this opportunity.\"Im just looking forward to the festivities getting underway.\"The Corn Exchange played host to the sell-out evening on Saturday, January , celebrating the Bards birthday where guests were entertained by an outstanding lineup of speakers and entertainers.Stephen Amos gave the Immortal Memory and the Toast to the Lassies was made by Melrosian , Ben Magowan, which was matched by an excellent reply from Rev.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten.

In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing.

The process is very simple. No haggling with pushy car sales people over price no issues with selling it later on.There are certain conditions you have to be aware of - such as the carrsquos appearance and the number of miles travelled.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago. Toyota are global leaders when it comes to hybrid technology and have been promoting the benefits since their very first Prius hybrid back in . Where some car manufacturers have just started their hybrid journey, this year saw Toyota launch its th generation hybrid range. In addition to the Prius range, you can now get Yaris, Corolla, C-HR and RAV with hybrid.At Helensburgh Toyota, situated just  minutes outside Glasgow, you can have complete peace of mind in the family run business that has supplied new and used Toyotarsquos for over  years.As an independent company, customers are important to them. The staff are knowledgeable and offer the advice you need in a relaxed non-pushy environment. And when you trade in your car next time around, it is the same friendly faces that greet you. \"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Helensburgh Toyota Hybrid\",\"description\": \"Helensburgh Toyota Hybrid\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media QVQzUDa poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests QVQzUDa.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Switching to hybrid is effortless and whatrsquos more, yoursquoll enjoy an even better driving experience at a cheaper price.Therersquos no big mystery, itrsquos not a dferent style of driving and you definitely donrsquot need to plug anything in to charge your vehicle.The Toyota hybrid models have two power sources, a petrol engine and an electric motor. The cars are self-charging which means every moment you are driving, your battery is charging even when slowing down, so no need to plug anything in. Whether in the town or on the motorway, hybrids feel no dferent to drive than a petrol car, offering a quiet and relaxing ride and still delivers the power you need.Speaking about the increase in hybrid orders, Kirsteen McGuire, Helensburgh Toyota Sales Manager said: ldquoThe hybrid message across the car industry is finally hitting home. More and more people are making the switch to hybrid and in turn benefitting from lower tax and petrol costs. Where other car manufacturers are playing catch up, Toyota has been a trusted advocate of hybrid technology for many years. The reality is that manufacturers are moving to eventually producing only hybrid vehicles. I have worked for Helensburgh Toyota for  years and demand for hybrid has never been higher.If yoursquore new to Hybrid and are looking to experience Toyota Hybrid for yourself, why not book and appointment at the Helensburgh Hybrid Drive Event on Saturday  February.The team at Helensburgh Toyota are only too happy to give you more information and take you out on a test drive.www.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.helensburgh.toyota-------------------------------------------------------------------JorroIn  Jorro was created to be specialists in EV Charging for drivers and businesses across Scotland. Taking experience in renewable energy using Solar PV and a passion for zero emission transport, they decided that an independent company not linked to any manufacturer of cars, charge points or energy provider, would allow them to offer impartial advice to customers choosing to go electric for the first time.When plugging in the car at home, the smart charge point automatically decides when it is cheapest to charge. Paying just p per kWh overnight, which means you can travel up to , miles for just pound, compared to over pound in an efficient mpg petrol or diesel car. Even using typical electricity tarfs, customers are travelling over , miles per year for less than pound.To encourage EV drivers to charge safely at home rather than relying on the pin plug adaptor, the UK Government offers pound OLEV grant towards the cost of installing a home charge point. In Scotland, a further pound cash-back is available from Energy Saving Trust , reducing the cost further and in some installations covering the cost completely. To access the grants and extended three year warranty you must use an approved installer and check that like Jorro, they are approved by both OLEV and EST.The smallest fast charger on the market, which is smaller than an A piece of paper, EO Mini Pro is proving very popular for those looking for a discreet solution.Did you know Jorro offer charge points that can charge the car for free  If you have Solar Panels you can use the generated electricity to power the car with a Zappi Charge Point. Even in Scotland a typical Solar PV System can provide more than  miles of range per day.Some drivers may not have a convenient place to charge at home so installing charge points at work may be the solution with businesses able to claim up to pound, in grant funding to install charging for staff. Benefit-in-Kind is now  per cent for EVs, saving  per cent taxpayers up to pound, over three years compared to a typical diesel company car The team at Jorro are ready to help you switch to electric with simple, practical options at home and cost-effective commercial installations with free site surveys available across Scotland.www.jorrowww.jorro our-charge-points-models "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10981390.jpg?type=article-full","title":"poll-puts-scottish-independence-support-highest-nearly-four-years","story":"The Panelbase poll puts Yes support at % - up five percentage points from a previous study.The poll commissioned by the Scot Goes Pop blog with the help of a crowdfunder and conducted between January  and , also says that pro-independence parties are on course to take % of the seats at Holyrood at next years elections.The blog said the results of the poll were the \"best result for Yes in any poll conducted by a member firm of the British Polling Council since the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum in the summer of \".:New poll on Scottish independence finds even split between Yes and NoBlogger James Kelly said it was a \"particularly remarkable result\" for a poll conducted by Panelbase, which was one of two pollsters that in  and  frequently reported a Yes vote that was a little below the % achieved in the  referendum.It is the third poll in a matter of days that has shown at least half of Scotland now backs independence.A Survation poll taken the week before Britain formally left the EU found a - split between those in favour of independence and those who would prefer to stay in the UK.The poll of , Scots, commissioned by the nationalist think tank Progress Scotland, was conducted at about the same time as a YouGov survey that found a narrow majority for independence, at  per cent.:New poll on Scottish independence puts Yes aheadBut the Panelbase poll has revealed a greater support for independence than any of the recent surveys.Anaverage of the three polls would give Yes % support.A poll of Scottish Parliament voting intention described by the blog as \"even more sensational\" indicates that the SNP would be heading for an overall majority in the forthcoming Scottish Parliamentary elections.An analysis of the poll results creates a projection that would have the SNP on  seatsleaving the other parties on .

But in reality, for the vast majority of readers going about their work and le, very little will change as a result of leaving the EU.The SNP needs to understand this, see the parallels to independence, and ride the wave. Its ability to do so could well be the dference between success and failure both in next yearrsquos Scottish Parliament election, and in the second independence referendum which it hopes will follow.I have never been of the opinion that the SNPrsquos strategic approach to Brexit has been entirely smart. Of course it is sensible of it to position itself as the party of Remain in a country which voted  per cent to stay. And of course it made the right judgment to suppose that those SNP voters who also voted to leave the EU will fall back into line, with an independent Scotland being their bigger prize.But the SNP allowed itself to be sucked into the hysteria of Brexitrsquos impact, and it is one aspect of its approach which will have to changeit is to be successful in a future independence referendum. Because, self-evidently, the walls have not fallen in since Friday night, as many predicted, just as the walls did not fall in the day after the Brexit vote, as many predicted, just as the walls will not fall in on January  after the end of the transition period, as many predict.This matters to the SNP because its politicians now need to put a nation at ease by selling the message that the walls will not fall inthey vote for independence. In order to achieve that it needs to dial down the hysterical messaging on Brexit.There are other big-ticket SNP messages which will need to changethe party is to fulfil its raison drsquoetre. Perhaps the biggest of all is its policy on membership of the very institution under discussion, the EU.Whatever the UK Governmentrsquos negotiations with Brussels over the next  months bring, it is highly unlikely that they will produce any kind of customs union. This gives the SNP a migraine, because its policy of negotiating membership of the EU for a post-independent Scotland by definition means entering into the EUrsquos Customs Union.And, as we have seen rehearsed atover the last four years in relation to the border on the island of Ireland, Scotlandrsquos membership of the EU would create the need for some sort of check on goods travelling between Scotland and England.The nature of the check, and the hardness of the border, will quite rightly be the subject of debate, but the core problem will not go away, and it is utterly toxic for a nationalist campaign hoping to win over people who are instinctive, often emotional Unionists.It is the sort of issue which turns elections, and referenda. And unlike in Ireland, we canrsquot hide the problem at the bottom of the sea.So what can the SNP do to avoid it  Well, much as those inside the SNP hate to talk about it, even privately, the political reality of its position is that all roads lead to EFTA.The European Free Trade Association has four memberswhich are not members of the EU or its customs union, but are in the single market by virtue of their inclusion in the European Economic Area.It has been made perfectly clear, and is perfectly logical, that an independent Scotland would be welcomed into the group, and there is very little about this route that doesnrsquot make sense for the SNP.Externally, to a nation which showed little unrequited love for the EU before the Brexit referendum ushered in a wave of marches and flag-buying, and which will by then have realised that le outside the EU is not akin to a scene from  Days Later, this is a fairly easy sell. Scotland would be in the free trade area, and would enjoy freedom of movement. But it would not economically self-harm through a customs barrier with its biggest trading partner ndash England ndash and it would not politically self-harm by risking a physical border on Britain.It is, to quote several politicians in the last decade, the best of both worlds.The SNPrsquos largest problem will be the internal sell to a politician and activist base which has become emotionally committed to the EU. Logic doesnrsquot always work in these situations, and they would not be the first set of politicians to place themselves in political harm because they cannot see the wood for the trees.Inevitably, the SNPrsquos leadership would have to present EFTA as a stepping stone to full EU membership. It would say that Scotland would ldquopark in EFTA until free trade and movement were secured both to the UK and to the EU.But, with that highly unlikely to be possible, Scotland would park in EFTA and then throw the car keys in the North Sea. Indeed, it seems perfectly likely to me that Scotland, like Norway, will benefit sufficiently from EFTA membership that the public clamour to rejoin the EU will evaporate, as it has in Norway, which now sees pro-EU polling in the teens.The SNP still has a lot of work to do to persuade the  per cent-or-so persuadables that independence is a good idea. Flag-waving leftism wonrsquot do that. They need to see a competent operation taking sensible decisions. One of those will be a sensible decision on the future relationship with Europe.As the dust settles, it will become politically impossible for the SNP to sell the consequences of EU membership to these people. And so, as we will see in the years to come, it matters not how many lights Donald Tusk leaves on for Scotland.We are not going back in.

More than four out of every five people in the UK have access to a carworldwide, there are around a billion cars in use, and each year, almost  million are manufactured.Almost all scientists agree this is a major factor in climate change, and even climate sceptics acknowledge that the internal combustion engine is environmentally damaging and a health problem air pollution, to which motor vehicles are a big contributor, kills seven million people globally each year, and . million more die in road traffic accidents.But the alternatives to petrol and diesel are no panacea. Even the best of them, liquid hydrogen engines , have environmental costs in manufacturing the fuel. And therersquos the practical problem that you canrsquot fill up your car unless you live near one of the -odd stations, which are all in Calornia or Japan.The manufacture of battery-powered electric cars has a similar carbon cost to conventional vehicles, while the mining of rare earth elements, and metals such as lithium and cobalthas a signicant environmental cost. And you donrsquot do much to reduce the use of fossil fuelsyou plug in your electric vehicle and it gets its charge from a coal-fired power station. When it comes to health, battery-powered cars could potentially even increase particulate emissions.In any case, when it comes to the environment, consumers like talking about it more than they like doing anything. For all the campaigns against drinking straws or carrier bags, there will be huge resistance to greener replacements until they offer comparable benefits to those of existing cars.People value the freedom and flexibility of cars, and current electric vehicles are technically limited ndash especially in range. Theyrsquore fine for town use, but you probably couldnrsquot drive one much further than Aberdeen to Glasgow without a y period recharging. Aberdeen to London ndash a -mile, nine-hour drive on one tank of petrol or diesel ndash would take at least twice as long, since it takes most electric vehicles eight hours fully to recharge, and very few have a range above  miles.Perhaps the electric technology will improve, or perhaps hydrogen carswill catch on. In either case, however, the entire infrastructure of filling stations will have to be converted. There are currently , of them , and many more would be needed, and closer together, for electric charging. Itrsquos hard to see how rural areas like the West Highlands will acquire those new facilities within  years.There is the possibility, then, especially given the rather unexpected revised plan to prohibit new hybrids, that these measures could actually increase the number of cars on the roads, with all the attendant pressures on parking, congestion and so on,it turns out that those who can afford to keep more than one: an electric run-around for short trips, and an old-fashioned vehicle for longer journeys, or those in remote areas.This ambitious and high-minded target may be intended to force car manufacturers into change, but it also assumes that they can come up with the goods ndash which is by no means guaranteed.It may have the unintended consequence of making the UK resemble Cuba after the revolution, when ancient cars stayed on the road for decades, because replacements were unavailable because of American sanctions.Cars need to get fast again. If affordable, quickly-charged and long-range new vehicles, and the support networks for them, arenrsquot developed pronto, we could still be in polluting petrol and diesel models long after . Unfortunately, the cars we currently drive donrsquot look as picturesque as s Buicks, and wonrsquot last as well, either."},{"url":null,"title":"hippfest-festival-celebrates-10th-anniversary","story":"And now audiences will once again enjoy the wonders of the cinema as it was before the age of sound as Scotlands only festival dedicated to silent films gets underway.Details have been revealed of the programme for the th edition of the event, which takes place in the in the BNess Hippodrome, Scotlandrsquos oldest purpose-built cinema, during March.The Mask of Zorro will be screenedAffectionately known as lsquoHippFest, the festival celebrates the magic of early cinema by showcasing restored versions of films rarely seen by modern qudiences, each one accompanied by live music, just as they would have been on their original opening night.:The GFT at  - a celebration of the beating heart of Glasgows love for filmOrganisers Falkirk Community Trust say this years programme is packed with silent films featuring masked crusaders, real-le martyrs and mysterious femme fatales, and will also offer talks, workshops and tours for those who attend.And, in the spirit of the iconic Keystone Cops of the era, the event will begin with a huge custard pie fight among willing participants.Alison Strauss, Festival Director, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be celebrating our th edition, and so grateful to our audiences for joining us on the journey so far.\"Expectations are high but we are confident that this yearrsquos HippFest will be our most successful yet. \"Alison StraussAmong the highlights of the will be the world premiere of a new restoration of  drama The Loves of Mary, Queen of Scots, an extremely rare British historical feature film full of intrigue, betrayal and scandal.Directed by Denison Clt the film was one of the last made by the major British studio Ideal before the cinema entered a slump in  and many indigenous filmmaking firms closed.It stars Fay Compton, one of the icons of the British silent scene as Mary, along with Gerald Ames and Ivan Samson.Fay Compton as Mary, Queen of ScotsOther productions ing to the big screen in Scotland for the first time in decades include The Mark of Zorro, a swashbuckling epic from  starring screen-idol Douglas Fairbanks as the elusive swordsman and original caped crusader.To get into the spirit of the adventure film, audiences are encouraged to dress up as Zorro, while music will be provided by Scotlandrsquos own mariachi band, lsquoRapido Mariachirsquo.Screen highlights during the festival will also include the premiere of Laurel and Hardyrsquos recently restored Duck Soup from , which was later remade with sound as Another Fine Mess.:Paisley lsquoBlack Hogmanayrsquo tragedy -Victims to be remembered at wreath-laying ceremonyDanish superstar of the s Asta Nin also appears in a screen version of Hamlet, playing a cross-dressing Hamlet whose true sex is kept secret to secure the future of the throne.The festival will start witha custard pie fightOther international highlights include Ernst Lubitschrsquos Lady Windermerersquos Fan, based on Oscar Wildersquos hit play, Chinese silent A String of Pearlsbased on Guy de Maupassantrsquos short story The Necklace, and Filibus: The Mysterious Air Piratean exciting thriller about a Baroness turned jewel-thief and uses an airship.ActorPaul McGann will to provide live narration of the closing night screening of French film LrsquoHomme du Large .Sambrooke Scott, Manager of Film Hub Scotland said: \"Itrsquos a fantastic showcase of film from another age, brought vividly to new le by a host of wonderful musicians through their brilliant live scores.\"Itrsquos a rare jewel of festival that brings excited audiences from near and afar and this yearrsquos edition promises to be one of the best yet.Laurel and Hrdy will featureDavid White, Chair of Falkirk Community Trust said: ldquoThis world-class festival is packed with distinctive community events and high-profile film restorations accompanied by some of the most accomplished musicians working in this unique field.\"\"The organisers have pulled together a programme to appeal to all ages, and reaching right across the community.\"We would also like to take this opportunity to thank our core funders, local businesses, and all the film archivists, artists and musicians who work with the teams at Falkirk Community Trust to make this Festival one of Scotlandrsquos great cultural events.\""},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW   The shocking realities of life on Universal Credit","story":"ARRIVING with the usual claims of ldquounprecedented access, the BBCrsquos look at the introduction of Universal Credit seemed to cover the familiar terrain of desperate claimants up against a shambolic system.

Mr Quinn estimates it now supports around  million Scottish citizens ldquoin terms of services they consume and rely on.Built with energy efficiency in mind, as compared to other data centres that often repurpose existing buildings, the facility was designed with reducing its potential carbon load in mind.DataVita uses the local climate to cool the infrastructure, using indirect air cooling strategies to feed outside air around the building and turning away from traditional, energy guzzling cooling systems.Mr Quinn said: ldquoThere is a big cooling element to data centres that traditionally would have used air conditioning. Instead we use Scotlandrsquos climate to cool the centre.ldquoPeople often assume the best place to have a data centre would be somewhere extremely cold but that produces other problems when you have to heat or condition it to get more humidity.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Trivandrum may now officially be Thiruvanathapuram but older names sometimes stick. A few months ago I was in Mumbai, and noticed how many people there still call the city Bombay – a rather more beautul name, in spite of the soft syllables of Mumbai. Mumbai sounds like mother Bombay is evocative of style and glamour, and all the ebullience for which that city of  million people is renowned. And then there is Bollywood, a perfect name, that would lose all its appeal were it to become Mollywood.Yesterday in TrivandrumI had two contrasting conversations. India is a country that loves conversations we, by contrast, are tight-lipped in the public space, and apt to view conversational forays with indference, sometimes even with suspicion. : Some more proof we really are all Jock Tamson’s bairns – leader comment: Why ‘sedition’ has no place in a mature democracy – leader comment‘Everybody hates the British’In India one engages, and at the literary festival I have been attending, there has been a dizzying amount of engagement. The first conversation was unusual, though, as it was an exception to the courtesy with which India treats visitors. The conversation, which took place over lunch with two women who were readers of my books, one of them a public intellectual here in India, started well enough, but was suddenly marred by the younger of the two announcing, “Everybody hates the British, you know.” She then added, for good measure, “The English are really dreadful people.”This was over a plate of fish curry. Silence. She stared at me. A possible response might have been to point out that England and Scotland are dferent countries, but then her first comment had been about the British, a rather broader description. However one interpreted it, though, it was a breach of comity. You do not address a stranger in that way, and no entire people can be described as really dreadful, eventheir ancestors did some dreadful things.The conversation moved to historical apology, a familiar enough theme, with well-rehearsed arguments on the role of apology in committing the wrongs of the past to history. The Amritsar Massacre is still a sore topic here, and its centenary has revived the sense of hurt it engendered. This, I thought, was an echo of that hurt.Long shadowsThe second conversation was a complete contrast. That took place under a tree, with a retired lecturer in English language from a local college, a man who embodied all the charm and moral seriousness that one encounters in so many in this country. Le in India has a serious edge to it that is sometimes obscured in the affluent West: people here have often had to struggle for their education they have to battle against a harsh climate, want, corruption, and the sheer weight of a massive population. How does one get ahead in leone is rubbing shoulders with over a billion people Matters of the mind are very pressing here. We talked about the state of India today, about the long shadows of caste and, more broadly, the burdens of history. There are Scotsmen everywhere in Indian history, he said to me. “Look around this place – that observatory down there, for example – that was a Scotsman who set it up. And all the engineers on the railways and the teachers and the missionaries in this place – Kerala has a large Christian population – so many of those were Scotsmen. And you know something  They believed in education, when our local potentates only wanted their people educated.” They, at least, were not really dreadful.There is, of course, real and understandable resentment over the depredations of the British Raj, and indeed over company rule. William Dalrymple’s The Anarchy is much talked about in India at present: he shows theand depth and breadth of the exploitation of India by a relatively small number of British aries. But it is not just British colonialism that comes into contemporary Indian political debate – there is a far more signicant instance of history being used for contemporary political purposes in this country.Europe’s identity politicsThis occurs in the contemporary argument in India over identity politics. Here the time-scale is much longer, and stretches back thousands of years to the origins of contemporary Indian civilization. Is Indian civilization indigenous to India, or did it originate by way of Steppe migration  You might think this was ancient history – and it sounds rather like it – but it lies at the heart of the current political le of this country. Identity is tied up with citizenship, and the rights that citizenship confers. Is India a monocultural country or is it a pluralistic country composed of a patchwork of faiths and secular identities In Mumbai I had lunch with an old friend, an Indian writer, who was on the verge of tears as he spoke of these arguments. It is a very isive issue, but then identity politics is a very isive issue wherever it raises its head. It is their internal problem, of course, but we are peripherally caught up in India’s identity issues because Scots were part of the Raj, no matter how much we may pretend that it was an English enterprise. Remember all the railway engineers and administrators, all the district commissioners and so on in Africa.And of course we have our own identity issues. They are simmering away in the background, and come to the fore whenever there is a debate about Gaelic road signs and Gaelic-speaking police cars. And then there is the small matter of European identity.A sense of local identity is important, and gives meaning and texture to le, but it can be a potent agent of conflict. Perhaps we would all benefitthe emphasis were to sht from subsidiary identities, and to focus on the identity that really matters: our shared humanity, our planetary identity, so to speak. An important aspect of our identity is that we are late Homo sapiens. The other ieties of Homo, we might remind ourselves, are no longer here.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"uk government must never be allowed to blacklist journalists it doesn t like leader comment","story":"The UK Government#s decision to bar selected media organisations from a Brexit briefing by civil servants is an alarming step towards #populist# attacks on the free press.If there’s one thing that unites the dictators, tyrannical monarchs and undemocratically ‘elected’ presidents of this world, it is a passionate hatred of the free press.In a country where an inidual has illegitimately assumed absolute control, they become like the sacred king in Scottish anthropologist James George Frazer’s book The Golden Bough, constantly living in fear of being murdered by their successor. Having strived for power, they now find themselves trapped by it, almost forced to lash out, sometimes with deadly force, at those who dare ridicule them or point out flaws.Over the last few years, an alarming trend has been gathering force in the democracies of the world, in which so-called ‘populist’ leaders have started to attack the press in ious dferent ways.: Journalists walk out after Number  bars outlets from Brexit briefing: White House bans BBC and critical press from key briefingIn Vladimir Putin’s Russia, “murders and physical attacks against journalists continue to go unpunished”, according to Reporters Without Borders. And Draconian laws have been used by the state to put pressure on the press to the extent that “leading independent news outlets have either been brought under control or throttled out of existence”, it adds in the  World Press Freedom Index entry for th-placed Russia.‘Enemy of the People’However, some populists have adopted slightly subtler tactics. Donald Trump, for example, regularly lambasts the “mainstream media” or what he sometimes calls the “fake news media” and “the Enemy of the People”, a phrase long associated with dictators like Stalin. Membership of this group appears to include most of the biggest names in American journalism: the Washington Post, the New York Times, NBC News, ABC, CBS and CNN. It is a tactic designed to cast doubt on anything they report and bolster news organisations that explicitly support Trump.In this respect, Boris Johnson is not remotely like Putin or even Trump. However, the decision to bar journalists working for selected news outlets from a briefing on his Government’s Brexit strategy given by civil servants, who are supposed to be politically neutral, is an alarming sign of a step towards this populist strategy. The Scotsman and other Scottish media were also not informed about the briefing.Such actions by politicians are not unprecedented. In , reporters from the , Daily Mail andsaid they were barred from then First Minister Alex Salmond’s first press conference after the independence referendum, although this was perhaps less serious as it was held to announce his resignation.All-for-one solidarityBut for anyone who thinks such actions are not particularly worrying, the UK Government’s ban on some members of the press resulted in a boycott of the briefing by leading political correspondents, including the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, ITV’s Robert Peston and reporters from the , the Daily Mail, the Sun, the Financial Times and the .This rare display of all-for-one solidarity across the press’s political spectrum was designed to send a message to the UK Government that it must heed – the British mainstream media will not collude in this populist tactic.Politicians can obviously give interviews to inidual journalists they think will give them more favourable coverage or, just as Johnson avoided the BBC’s Andrew Neil ahead of the general election, they can avoid journalists they fear.But they absolutely cannot enlist civil servants and the apparatus of Government to systematically exclude news organisations that criticise them in an attempt to influence scrutiny of their actions.And it is a challenge to the freedom of the press that journalists must stand against. The alternative is to take an immoral, dishonest path towards providing increasingly obsequious coverage in the hope of avoiding being added to the blacklist.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish private schools to pay full business rates","story":"MSPs voted down an amendment from the Scottish Conservatives to the Non Domestic Rates Bill which would have allowed independent schools to continue to benefit from  per cent relief on their rates bills.

She added thatprivate schools closed, there would be more strain on the state sector.However public finance minister Kate Forbes said schools had had three years to prepare for the change and Labourrsquos Sarah Boyack added the move would create a ldquolevel playing field as state schools did not get rates relief.And despite the Scottish Liberal Democrats backing the Conservative amendment, it was defeated by  votes to .MSPs also voted by  to , against a move by Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman to devolve the setting of business rates back to local authorities - a power which was shted to central government by Margaret Thatcher.Mr Wightman said his proposal, would have ldquorighted a fundamental wrong. He also dismissed concerns raised by business organisations and Cosla about the speed at which the power would be given to councils, saying that it would not happen until .The proposal had caused a row between the Scottish Greens and the SNP, with the former accusing the government of ldquoscaremongeringamid claims the plan would see small businesses face a rates hike of more than £ as rates relief could end.Despite the idea being backed ldquoin principle by Labour and the Conservatives, both parties voted against the amendment, with only the Scottish Liberal Democrats voting in support. Mr Wightman said: ldquoNon Domestic Rates are a local tax and for well over a century they were under full control of the level of government to whom they belonged before being centralised by Margaret Thatcherrsquos government.ldquoThis vote today is the first time in the history of devolution to make provision for this historic wrong to be corrected. Itrsquos a vote for democracy and to make Scotland a normal European country by giving local authorities the right to control their own tax base. ldquoNon Domestic Rate is a local tax, it belongs to local government and councils. Just as the Scottish Parliament sets Scottish tax rates so too should local authorities set local tax rates.Responding to the concerns of business and councils, he added: \"Ive always recognised that ing rate setting powers to local authorities could not, and should not, be achieved overnight. Discussions need to take place between government and Cosla over the local government settlement and fiscal framework, and and thats why my amendment allows that time.\" : Pressure grows on Holyrood to ensure major increase in council funding in next budgetHe said his amendment also ensured that \"the power to offer rates relief\" would remain, and also allowed for the \" date to be changed sofour years is not enough it can be extended.\"However Kate Forbes, said that the amendment had jeopardised local authority funding guarantees and ldquowould have seen  dferent rates introduced by local authorities across Scotland. She added: ldquoSome parties may ideologically believe thatrsquos right but to do it in one vote with scrutiny or thought to what it means is no way to set such a change in motion.The defeat was welcomed by the Federation of Small Businessesrsquo Andrew McRae, who said: ldquoThis was not the time to hit small businesses with new annual rates bills in excess of £,.However Public Finance Minister Kate Forbes, said that the amendment had jeopardised local authority funding guarantees and abolish rate relief worth £m, and would have seen  dferent rates introduced by local authorities across Scotland. \"Some parties may ideologically believe thats right but to do it in one vote with scrutiny or thought to what it means is no way to set such a change in motion,\" she said.\"Andy Wightman is to be commended for raising the profile of this issue. I know Cosla are keen to see fiscal empowerment and the way in which local authorities are funded will now be part of the fiscal framework taken forward at pace.\"That includes looking at integrated local government funding mechanisms and all local government taxes, including looking at implications of devolving Non Domestic Rates but also how it sits within wider local government funding.\"Scots Tory finance spokesperson Murdo Fraser called for a more comprehensive review of the business rates system, which he said was \"creaking at the seams\" and the question of funding of local government needs to be tied into a \"broader discussion about the role of councils\".©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"orangemen aim to scale kilimanjaro","story":"A dozen Orangemen from Co Down are planning an ambitious trip to Africa during which they will attempt to scale Mount Kilimanjaro.The men from Banbridge District No  have a proud history of undertaking gruelling fundraising ventures, with this particular challenge requiring two years of groundwork.Deputy District Master Stuart Magill said: “In this last  years at Banbridge Orange Hall we’ve raised over £, for dferent causes and charities.“Drumming For Heroes from LOL  has raised £,. They’ve carried a Lambeg drum up to the top of Ben Nevis and cycled from John O’Groats to Landsend with a Lambeg on the back of a bike. “They also did the four peaks of the UK in four days, and walked the route of King Billy from the south of England to Carrickfergus and down to the Boyne, also bringing the Lambeg.”Banbridge Orange Hall is home to several dferent lodges including LOL  and LOL  of which Stuart is a member. “This time it will be our lodge that’s doing Kilimanjaro though we won’t be bringing a Lambeg – it’s going to be hard enough as it is,” he continued. “It’s a follow up to the Walk of Remembrance when we walked  miles from Thiepval Memorial to Menin Gate.”The -year-old added: “It was my idea to climb Killimanjaro. I’ve never done it before, that’s why I want to do it. “There’s  of us doing it. My biggest worry was getting .

There’s a big build to allow us to pay for it, the cost of the trip is coming out of each person’s pocket so that every penny raised is going to the charity. It also gives us plenty of time to train for it, and also to raise money for the two charities.”Two charities are set to benefit – the Children’s Cancer Unit in Royal Victoria Hospital and Angel Wishes which helps children with cancer and supports their families.He said the two charities were close to the hearts of those taking part in the trek as they were good friends with a family from Banbridge who are indebted to the services provided by the organisations.In pictures: NI man finds beauty in derelict properties around the Province Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Stuart said: “The oldest person taking part is in his sixties and the youngest is in his twenties. “The majority of training will be in the Mournes for fitness and stamina, but there’s no training over here really for the altitude.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"edmund rice to host an evening of light","story":"EDMUND Rice College in Glengormley are inviting the public to attend a special night to support mental health across the North Belfast community.The Evening of Light will take place at the school tonight Wednesdayat pm featuring music and reflection.Music will form a reflective and peaceful atmosphere for the evening, delivered by the Edmund Rice College School Choir, current Year  pupil Robert Hamilton and musicians Two Tempo.There will also be an opportunity to hear from two key speakers from Alpsand Mind Skills and information on their respective programs on mental health, resilience and suicide prevention.The first guest speaker, Frank Diamond is an integral part of the team at Live and Learn Alps, a not for profit organisation, working directly with communities offering support, guidance and education around mental health awareness and suicide prevention.The organisation was founded in September  and has trained upwards of , people in QPRtraining.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe road has been closed.

The South Derry MLA said: The British governments disastrous Brexit policy has caused huge concern among farmers and agricultural producers. On Monday, I was glad to see that the assembly passed an LCM which ensures our support for Westminsters commitment regarding  payments. Confirmation of funding for this year will bring some relief to farmers, but this is unfortunately short term. The Single Farm Payment from the EU represents  per cent of farm incomes and is crucial to the livelihoods of farmers and to the rural economy. In  , the total value of payments awarded to Mid Ulster amounted to pound,,. The idea that this amount of revenue could be removed from the local economy post EU exit is a scary thought.There is huge uncertainty about funding post  and farmers have been kept totally in the dark about their futures, and Mr Poots comments regarding his intention to remove the flat rate system which brought all farmers, whether based in the mountains or on lowlands, to an equal level, is a further worry. Hill farmers are already at a disadvantage, and the flat rate system set about to create a level playing field. On top of this, Mr Poots has indicated that he plans toto a productivity based payment which would further disadvantage hill farmers. It is Sinn Feacuteins position that this would be unfair, and our representatives on the DAERA committee, particularly Chair Declan McAleer MLA, has raised this as a concern with the minister.Sheep farmers in the mountains have already lost the ACN payment, which we are calling for the reinstatement of. Farmers cant plan or invest and many are genuinely fearful for their livelihoods and the future of their farms and businesses. All of this is a consequence of Brexit and the British government dragging us out of the EU against the democratic will of the majority of people here, and is another example of why Brexit is bad for the people of the north. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

The plaque which is placed in an area where young people would meet will assist in highlighting Lavey’s townland’s, the meanings of their names and their Irish translations.

Pond Park, in Kilrea, for example, has several street lights out and this is one of the main routes to two schools as well as a well-used walking route for local people.The Bann DEA representative added: “I am grateful to the Street Lighting Engineer for the Northern Division for his help in this matter and look forward to working with the Department in the future to ensure that all these issues are resolved.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On Friday there was a spectacular Festival of Lights, where images of famous local women, including Bronagh, were projected ontothe Tower Museum. And on Saturday Bronagh herself attended a lunch at the Tower Museum where former Factory Workers come together to reminisce. Later that day she joined some of the city’s younger generation at the Girl Power event in the Guildhall. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle said the weekend was a great success. “As a whole, this project has a great message and one that we as a Council were very keen to promote. “The best thing was that we not only celebrated figures like Amelia Earhart and Annie Russell Maunder, who are known within our District and far beyond, but equally we were able to highlight and thank our ‘factory girls’ who played a huge role in a prolic era of our history. “The Girl Power event was also brilliant to see, with so many confident young women coming together to encourage one another and talk about what they can do to change the world. googletag.cmd.push “For myself as a female First Citizen, I was certainly inspired meeting many women and girls who have shaped, and will continue to shape, a positive future for us all.” Ruth McPhillips, Council Events Officer, said that it was important that the message behind the project was now carried forward. “We’re delighted with the success of Herstory, and hopefully it’s something that we can now build on in years to come. “While organising the event, I just loved meeting and hearing the stories of our factory workers and learning more about the historic figures who made such an impact on the District we live in today. “Preserving their stories and making sure that they are told for generations to come, as well as inspiring younger women to follow their dreams, was the motivation behind taking part, and I feel that we have achieved that.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The First XV made their experience known at the Foyle College’s Limavady Road campus, dominating both halves with slick passing, clever footwork and powerful drives forward.Foyle had been aiming to cause an upset as the odds of beating the superior Campbell College were stacked against them. Beating Carrick Grammar - at home in Round  of the competition, Foyle’s coaches Ally Ferguson and Neil Stewart will have relished the opportunity to challenge such a highly rated team in the fourth round tie.Having taken Foyle’s players to Limerick to play against quality teams like Crescent College this year, they had logged an impressive win against Rainey earlier this season. Before the game, Foyle Director of Rugby, Paul O’Kane had highlighted the need to perform from the first whistle but it was not to be as Foyle conceded an unconverted try in the opening  minutes.Despite this, Foyle still looked bright with their forwards dominating scrums in the opening stages albeit conceding possession too easily whilst passing out. Campbell College’s lock D. Harkin drove forward brilliantly utilising skilful footwork and Foyle heads dropped as Harkin brought the ball down in the centre of the try line allowing fly half M. Rae to easily convert, widening the score to  points.A misunderstanding between two Foyle players resulted in a collision in collecting a Campbell drop kick and summed up the gulf in quality and experience between the two sides. Another brilliant run forward with slick hands from Campbell College saw centre L. Kenny score a converted try. Campbell College’s quality of passing was what allowed them to get forward so easily, despite Foyle gaining territory regularly, they were unable to match Campbell’s quality meaning they could not make the most of possession.Driving forward  minutes before half time, Campbell’s centre M. Booth gained another try and fly half R. Rae once again confidently converted to bring the half time score to - googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The heavens opened at half time to compound Foyle’s struggles but the squad looked undeterred lining up for the second half. It was in these opening stages that Campbell showcased their strength in a flurry of rucks and mauls, making the most of possession and flanker J. Jeffery scoring a decisive  points. It was the conversion of this try in the second half that sealed Foyle’s fate bringing a dference of  points and the score that would last the rest of the game. Despite the away team’s D. Harkin and J. Jeffrey dominating rucks and winning possession it was then midway through the second half when the intensity of their drives forward dropped. Knowing there was little chance of Foyle coming back in the game Campbell College allowed Foyle to push forward, maintain possession and come closest to scoring the coveted points they so desperately searched for. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Foyle College break forward. A rouse of the crowd and a succession of line outs close to Campbell’s try line saw tensions rise between the two teams, with a resulting ruck ending in flared tempers. The gain of territory and maintaining of possession from the penalising of a number of high tackles from Campbell College proved fruitless for Foyle however with the away side able to break the lines and push Foyle back into their own half.The final whistle at - sealed Foyle’s fate with an exit from the Danske Medallion Shield but the players shouldn’t be too disheartened by the scoreline. This was a quality side they went up against in Campbell College with a wealth of experience to make the most of their dominance. Foyle Principal, Patrick Allen offered his commiserations to the team on social media stating he was, “proud of the commitment and determination shown by the boys.” It will be an incredibly useful learning curve for Foyle who despite exiting the competition will take the tough lessons learned onto the rest of their season. They should eagerly look forward to facing Campbell College again in the future knowing first hand the quality of one of the best sides in the land.

Over the last five years he has lived in Dublin, Vancouver and London, crafting his own way through music. He has toured the States with the Five Irish Tenors and Europe with Anuna. He’s back in Derry and was recently working with Kieran Brown.“That’s how I started working with Paul Casey .“Kieran had organised to record a song we did called Hold On which mainly focused around the area of men’s mental health and we got a great response. “Paul really believed in me and what I could do as a performer vocalist. I’ve been performing for quite a while so I’m no stranger to the stage and singing is all I want to do. “So, from there I took matters into my own hands, recorded my first album with Paul and launched it in the Guildhall which in the end almost sold out so I was buzzing and quite overwhelmed with the response. “Then, with the band The Inside Out, we had just launched our EP in Sandino’s and it was class singing our own tunes to a decent crowd, about two weeks after that Paul buzzed me and asked me did I want to do Homegrown which was an unreal experience and to share the stage with one of my favourite bands PORTS was pretty special.”He really talks that enthusiastically. He’s a wee bit like being always at that point just before drunk when you’re feeling great – that’s George. googletag.cmd.push You’ve been busy promoting your own stuff but who  from Derry are you into  “At the minute Conor Mason’s new album On the Surface is on repeat, the first listen I liked a few songs, after the second and third I’m now totally hooked. A brilliant musician, a beautul voice and just total sincerity in his delivery. “PORTS are another and I’m itching to hear their new material, they shared a little at Homegrown and I loved it, they’re a masterful group of musicians and they just ooze comradeship, The Few and Far Between and Ancient Wave are my go to tunes. “Steven McCool is one of the best singers to come out of this town and he and all the band are fantastic. Elma Orkestra’s Flutter: Part One was something I didn’t see coming from Eoin and its cinematic style is stunning. “One song, Drive, in particular, got me through some tough times in LondonI’m being honest. I went to BLOOD’s album launch and yeah Noella and Jeanette are my cousins, but they’ve been a big inspiration of mine growing up. “Two fearless performers with two beautul raw and passionate voices, writing songs from their very core, I absolutely love them.” They absolutely love him back, Noella told me: “George’s music reflects the beautul soul he is, a gorgeous man with a gorgeous voice,” and Jeanette added, “He does this with a pure heart and a level of passion and love for his art that’s innate”. He’s also putting the feelers out for a record I’ve been looking for for ages, the absolute dote. He’s not one for sitting about though, I’m led to believe this is going to be a busy year for him with a few surprises lined up so what’s next for you George  “Two next gigs coming up are the Ulster Hall in Belfast on February . I’ll be releasing my new album in February also and on February  I’ve a gig in St Columb’s Cathedral with Ruth McGinley and The Priests.“Man, the new album is a big step up, it’s very much down that Irish channel but it also really showcases what I do best.” So, what’s the craic with the new album  googletag.cmd.push “I’m going to let it go out for pre-order on February , with it set for an April  release digitally. I get hard copies next week which I’ll leave in Cool Discs, meaning the only place people can buy the actual physical copy before the official release will be there!.”Keep up to date with George on his Facebook and Instagram and, sure why not, land down to Cool Discs for his albums.Al do a piece next week, send ye questionsIf you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

Flooding peoplersquos lives with the hope found in the good news of the gospel, bringing out the God-colours into the world.That is to be your primary aim as a Bishop.The sermon was followed by the Rite of Ordination and for the ordination prayer and laying on of hands, Archbishop Clarke was joined by other bishops, the Methodist President and former Presidents.The new bishop was then vested in his robes and given a Bible before being presented to the congregation who greeted him with loud, sustained applause. The Dean of Belfast, the Very Rev Stephen Forde, then installed Bishop McClay in his cathedral stall.At the reception which followed in Ulster Universityrsquos Birley Building, Bishop McClay expressed his thanks to all those who had taken part in the service, his parents and family and the many people who had travelled a distance to be there.Bishop McClay said he looked forward to building on the work of two predecessors, Bishop Harold Miller and Bishop Gordon McMullan, who he had been ldquoprivileged to serve under.He added: ldquoIrsquom very grateful for all that they have put in place by way of a heritage to build upon.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs. We already have an excellent hospital and fantastic staff, but the community deserves what everyone  has.ldquoWe also need to to engage with local medical providers who are the experts.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us.

A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos more crucial than ever we re-elect a Welsh Labour Government in . But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
