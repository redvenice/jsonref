Reyna pictured with her sisters. She says she has missed friends\u0027 overseas weddings as a result of not having a passport for year\u0027I\u0027m just so grateful to whoever handled my case, I\u0027d love to meet and thank the inidual worker because if it wasn\u0027t for him or her I\u0027d still be fighting.\u0027I haven\u0027t had a break in seven years. When employers tell you need to use up your holidays usually you\u0027re really excited but I just thought what\u0027s the point, I\u0027d rather work because I can\u0027t go anywhere.\u0027I\u0027ve had friends get married overseas and I\u0027ve not been able to go. I couldn\u0027t even get internal flights in the UK.\u0027It\u0027s not nice feeling like you\u0027re stuck somewhere.\u0027I needed that certificate to move on with my life, I shouldn\u0027t have had to go through it but it\u0027s an acknowledgement that I am a British citizen.\u0027It feels like a new start for me.\u0027I was born here, I\u0027ve grown up here, I went to school here and I\u0027ve always paid my taxes.\u0027It felt like a kick in the teeth being treated like someone who had just come from abroad.\u0027Reyna\u0027s father\u0027s name was left off her birth certificate as her mother feared the birth, out of wedlock, would be frowned upon.Reyna\u0027s parents split when she was just eight years old, but after her mother, Elizabeth, 54, died of cancer in 2009, she stayed close with her father, who lives in Blackpool.       Reyna\u0027s mother chose to keep the name of her British father off the birth certificate         Despite having a UK birth certificate Reyna was not automatically granted citizenshipWhen Reyna came to renewing her Danish passport in 2009, she was given a temporary passport for 12 months, but was told that without more than one reference from a Danish family member, or being able to prove she could speak Danish, she wouldn\u0027t qualify for any more documents.But having never lived in Denmark, she had never been taught to speak the language and only had her mother\u0027s half brother to act as a family reference.Turning to the British government aged 22 to get a British passport instead, she was told that she would need to complete a £1,500 Life in the UK citizenship test to qualify for a passport.She said that after purchasing a house with her mother\u0027s inheritance, she couldn\u0027t afford the test and struggled with her mental health after losing her mum.The red tape meant despite running her own reiki business, paying taxes and contributing national insurance she couldn\u0027t go abroad or even think about marrying partner of 15 months Tom Cross, 24 and was turned down for jobs and bank cards.Reyna said: \u0027For years I\u0027ve not been able to sort it out because the application process is so costly, and it has really affected my mental health.\u0027The thought of doing the exam was giving me really bad anxiety. I\u0027d lost my mum while I was doing my A Levels so I\u0027ve always had a negative association with exams.\u0027The cost of the process was huge as well, I had a friend in a similar position who told me the whole process had cost him £2,500. There was no way I was going to be able to afford that, I\u0027d just bought a house.\u0027Determined to head into 2020 with a fresh start, Reyna re-applied to the British Home Office in June with a standard form for citizenship, which costs £100, but supplemented her documents with an emotional cover letter setting out her position and what she had been through.In November she was told her application had been successful and after a ceremony at Bolton\u0027s Albert Hall this week, she was handed her certificate stating that she is now officially British.

I couldn\u0027t face another decade like the last one.\u0027I\u0027ve been told by the Mayor of Bolton it\u0027s very rare that they hand out a citizenship certificate with the birth place in the UK, it\u0027s just ridiculous that it\u0027s taken all this hassle.\u0027Now I\u0027ve got it, I\u0027m going to make up for all this time.\u0027If money wasn\u0027t an object I\u0027d love to go travelling round South India, but the first place I\u0027d like to go is back to see where my mum was born and meet all her family again, I haven\u0027t seen them since I was a little girl.\u0027In 2015, Reyna was told by the Home Office birth in the UK does not necessarily qualify an inidual as a British national and citizenship is automatic only for people whose parents are British or settled in the UK at the time of birth.A spokesman for the Home Office confirmed she had applied for British citizenship in June this year which was approved in November.They added: \u0027All citizenship applications are considered on their inidual merits and on the basis of the evidence available, in line with the published guidance and the British Nationality Act 1981.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook ordered reactivate Italian neo fascist party CasaPounds account","story":"Share this article \u0027The accounts we removed today violate this policy and will no longer be present on Facebook or Instagram.\u0027 CasaPound was founded in the late 1990s as a drinking club inspired by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. It took its name from the 20th-century American poet Ezra Pound, who was known for his fascist and antisemitic views.

So I always chose colours – yellow, red, blue – that punctuated that aspect of her’ It was 1977 and I was shooting Patti Smith for the cover of her album Easter. I was thinking a lot about Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the palette he uses in his painting The Annunciation: white for purity, red for the blood of Christ, blue for the heavens.Patti brought the white dress, which had been given to her by Robert Mapplethorpe. She brought the red scarf too – she still has it. And one of us threw in the feathers. The blue background is pretty much the exact blue in the Rossetti. That’s not what makes Patti’s eyes pop though. She has Elizabeth Taylor eyes. They always pop.Patti has talked about how I brought her into the world of colour. Prior to me, any photographer she worked with had always shot her in black and white – even Robert, who was her lover, and before that Judy Linn. But when she started putting her poetry to rock’n’roll, Patti’s being was electric. Even now, at 72, she electrifies people. So I always chose colours – bright yellow, red, this blue, lime green – that punctuated that aspect of her.If you know the album, you’ll know this isn’t the image we went with. During the shoot – against a different, brown background – Patti lifted up her arms. Easter was the album she worked on after she broke her neck and went through a very painful recovery. To be able to lift her arms in that way was like a resurrection of her spirit. So that’s the one we went with.Sometimes on a shoot I might say, “Move to the left” or something like that, but with Patti you don’t really need to pull anything out of her. She’s a performance artist. She gets it. There is always a need to talk, but with Patti I can work in a quieter fashion than when I photograph someone for the first time. Then, it’s all about gaining their trust – when I look through my lens, I can see in their eyes whether they’re scared or questioning what I want.People tend to limit me to “music photographer” but I’ve done everything from covers of Sports Illustrated and shoots for National Geographic to fine art with dolls and a book of self-portraits. I write songs too – in the UK, I’m known as Will Powers. I haven’t put new music out for some time, but in 1983 I had a lot of success with a single called Kissing with Confidence. So if people want to see me as a rock’n’roll photographer, or some famous person’s friend, I just think they’re limiting themselves, not me.It’s the same thing with Patti. If you go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and there’s a drawing exhibition on, there might be a Patti Smith next to a Picasso. People don’t really talk about that or how she’s also an accomplished photographer and the writer of 15 books of poetry, as well as memoirs. If they want to call her the godmother of punk, she’ll take it, but is that really all she is? I don’t think so.When I’m asked to do an album cover, I always want to hear it first. In some cases, the artist might not have done a full mix, might not have put down the vocals – and they’ll just offer to sing it to me, to my face, which can be great but also a little uncomfortable.Patti likes to sing. She sings all the time. She sings when she walks up the stairs. We’ll sing lines together like: “Goin’ to the chapel and we’re goin’ to get married” or “Remember walking in the sand”. Patti is fierce, authentic, complex. She is a poet, in everything she does.

However, its crown jewel is the Mail titles, including the Mail on Sunday, Daily Mail and Mail Online, which have been intensely critical of Soros because of his donations to liberal causes.Soros has become a hate figure among some sections of the political right wing in Europe and the US. His vilification has included outright conspiracy theories from figures including the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, and the Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán. Orbán has sought to portray Soros as an enemy of the country in which he was born and shut down a university partly funded by the investor.In February 2018 the Daily Mail published a front-page story headlined “Fury over billionaire’s plot to sabotage Brexit” featuring a picture of Soros, 89. The story was based on Soros’s donations to the Best for Britain group, which is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, and followed a front-page Daily  story that led to accusations of the use of antisemitic tropes.In June 2017 a Mail story ran an article reporting criticism of Soros as a “puppetmaster” who “successfully manufactured Europe’s migration crisis”. The same article said Soros was “public enemy number one of nationalists around the globe”.Paul Dacre, the editor under whom many anti-Soros articles were run, remains as the chairman and editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers, the DMGT subsidiary that controls the Mail titles, although the title is not widely regarded as an active editorial role.It is the first time that Soros’s fund has bet against DMGT or any other consumer publisher in the EU since investors were first forced to report short positions in 2012, according to Breakout Point, a short-tracking data service, which first reported the bet. However, the majority of the short positions that it must report are in the UK, Breakout Point said.Short sellers borrow shares from their owners and then sell them on, in the expectation that the price will fall. They then make a profit, having pocketed the proceeds from that sale, if they are able to buy the shares back at a cheaper price when they return them to their original owner.DMGT declined to comment.

About 70 people work at the restaurant and a further 30 work at the Cornwall Food Foundation charity, which will also be wound up.The closure comes only months after the celebrity chef’s UK restaurant business, including the Jamie’s Italian chain, Fifteen in London and Barbecoa, collapsed in May, making 1,000 staff redundant.In a statement, Fifteen said: “We are deeply saddened to announce that Fifteen Cornwall will close and cease trading with immediate effect.”It said the necessary steps towards liquidating both companies had been taken and liquidators would be in touch with all affected parties.Matthew Thomson, the chief executive of the Cornwall Food Foundation said: “This is an incredibly sad day for everyone and we will try our best to support those who have been impacted. I am profoundly sorry for the hurt, loss and distress this announcement will undoubtedly cause.”The seaside charitable venue opened by the celebrity chef 13 years ago survived the difficulties of Oliver’s wider business because it is an entirely separate business, with all its profits going back into the charity.While Oliver’s name is above the door under a licence agreement, the chef no longer has financial involvement and had been spending only occasional days in the kitchen working with apprentices.The restaurant trained six to 10 young unemployed people a year in its kitchens while serving up largely locally sourced seasonal food.Jamie Oliver said: “I am very surprised and saddened to learn that Fifteen Cornwall and the Cornwall Food Foundation have closed. Both organisations have always been run separately from us but the team has done an amazing job with the trainee programme, training over 200 chefs and reaching so many more along the way – so this is a huge blow. My thoughts are with everyone affected.”Since its launch, Fifteen Cornwall said two-thirds of the apprentices it had trained since 2006 were still working in the restaurant trade and many had set up local businesses, making it an important part of the economy in a county where regular work can be hard to find.The Cornish outpost was inspired by Oliver’s first restaurant, Fifteen in London, which he set up in 2002 and which closed its doors in May alongside the Jamie’s Italian chain.Earlier this year Thomson admitted that Fifteen Cornwall was finding times tough, particularly outside the school holidays.The restaurant made sales of about £3m last year but only broke even, after making an average profit of more than £200,000 a year for several years.Fifteen’s closure comes at a difficult time for the industry. A string of restaurants have got into difficulties recently including Byron, Carluccio’s and Patisserie Valerie. The sector has been hit by rising costs, a slowdown in consumer spending and a vast amount of competition after private equity funds ploughed millions of pounds into opening casual dining restaurants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34696afb7d94142b5aebaed9a6d26cab49b8fc5/0_152_4554_2732/master/4554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4895d38af00f4f648932b611f7675002","title":"us china trade deal in principle tariffs","story":"The White House has reached a “deal in principle” with Beijing to resolve the 17-month US-China trade war, according to a source briefed on the trade talks.The White House was expected to make an announcement later on Thursday, the source said.“The written agreement is still being formulated, but they have reached an agreement in principle,” the source said.

And yet depictions of autism frequently fail those they claim to represent, with dire consequences for autistic people.There are two mainstream narratives surrounding autism: that it is either a blessing or a curse. Either you are gifted with savant-like traits (think Rain Man) and excel in areas such as mathematics, or your autism is the reason you are isolated, alone and miserable. When Greta Thunberg called out ableist bullying and challenged assumptions, even she resorted to the “superpower” stereotype. And in the case of media coverage, these two extremes in expectations are sometimes quite literally presented as a dichotomy, with Forbes running headlines such as “Is Greta Thunberg ‘disabled’ or a superhero?” What if it is neither? Or both?The disability rights movement is founded on the principle of “nothing about us without us”. So it is difficult to see how representation of autism could ever be positive when we are rarely involved or even consulted. Autistic people are being constrained by the expectations and judgments of neurotypical people because we are so rarely the ones given space to talk about autism. I suspect that is partly due to a belief that autistic people (and disabled people more broadly) cannot speak for themselves. Seldom are autistic people part of the creative teams developing storylines involving autism. Indeed, this was a large problem with Atypical in its first season – none of the writers, directors or producers was autistic, and this resulted in the perpetuation of many stereotypes the community has spoken out against.What we are seeing in mainstream media is not a true reflection of autism. We are, instead, seeing what neurotypical people think autism is. Savan Gandecha, a YouTube creator and host of #AutismWithSav, told me he agrees that we need to “move away from the stereotypes – that will improve representation in the long run”. Autism is multifaceted, varied and exists on a spectrum, but we never see the ersity of autistic people and their symptoms.The consequences stretch far beyond simply finding television cringeworthy or uncomfortable to watch. Given that public perceptions of autism are largely predicated on these mainstream portrayals in cinema, television, theatre or books, the consistently poor depictions and subsequent misunderstandings about the condition can be incredibly harmful. Autistic people on screen very rarely engage in behaviours that are seen as more taboo – for example, stimming behaviours such as rocking or flapping – or are seen to have meltdowns, and if they do, it is seen as something to be mocked.Even in journalism, neurotypical (or allistic, or non-autistic) professionals are commissioned to write and speak about autism, seemingly with little understanding that they are talking about a key part of someone’s identity. Most recently, when Greta Thunberg wrote about her autism as a driving force in her activism, the vast majority of articles about it demonstrated a fundamental lack of awareness surrounding the language autistic people prefer.Depictions of autistic people as a monolith contribute to a culture in which we only recognise the condition in a small percentage of the people who are autistic. Despite what mainstream media would have you believe, not all autistic people are white, cisgender, young or male for every four men or boys diagnosed with autism, only one woman or girl is – but that is probably because representations aren’t erse enough. Savan concurs that “more representation is needed from other autistic people who are women and girls and … from BAME backgrounds”. Consequently, autism goes unrecognised and autistic people unsupported. We need representation that is made responsibly and with our input. We simply cannot afford for this misinformation to continue, even in the form of lighthearted teenage television shows.There has been some progress. Hollyoaks cast autistic teenager Talia Grant to play an autistic character and Channel 4’s Are You Autistic? was hosted by, and with the input of, autistic experts, but this is only a tiny shift and one that is hugely outweighed by poor representation.Autistic people ought to be the ones leading the conversation surrounding autism. But more importantly, allistic people need to listen and create a space in which we can do this. However, that would require an acknowledgment that no amount of well-intentioned speaking on behalf of autistic people will be anything other than ableist.• Ellen Jones is a campaigner and creator with a focus on LGBTQ+ rights, mental health and disability"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4495ad59f4108835ddf7eb2137bf9c10eefb1720/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d08b8a91cd38a937a3e71b8ce3f6ed31","title":"labour leave voters politics general election brexit","story":"They are the voters who could decide the future course of the country, but they’re not the stereotypes we’ve been soldA few weeks ago I met a couple of the stereotypes who could decide which way this country turns tomorrow. And guess what – they were nothing like you’d expect. You know the caricature I mean: the working-class Brexiter. The exact people the two big parties are battling over in the very last hours before the polls close. The mythical group pundits say stands at the heart of what Sky News bills as “the Brexit Election”.And yet I cannot think of any other demographic treated more superficially and transactionally than the four million-odd Labour voters who voted leave in 2016. Superficial is the Attenborough-esque spot on the news in which a intrepid TV crew treks to a post-industrial town and lurks in drizzle outside a branch of Sports Direct, ready to pounce upon exotic passersby and prod them into a few barks about Europe and “getting on with it”.Transactional is the way Westminster types (both red and blue) worry about whether their party sounds sufficiently “leave-y” or how Boris Johnson will don pristine workwear and plough a JCB through a polystyrene wall. Because that’s what the proles want, isn’t it? Sod what they need.At the very root is condescension, from all sides. You know how it goes: “Oh, these idiots who don’t know what they voted for!” Which is where a conversation I had just before this election comes in.I was visiting a lunch club run by a local volunteer in one of the poorest parts of Colchester, Essex, at the start of school half-term. Inside a scout hut, about 45 kids and their parents were getting a free cooked meal to ease the cost of holiday eating. Over chips, Gary and Rebecca were telling me how they regularly live off one meal a day. More happily, they remembered a rare summer holiday, a long weekend when they took their children 30 miles down the road to the seaside. Their borrowed caravan couldn’t fit everyone, so Gary slept on the ground outside.Yeah, they voted Brexit – not out of hatred of immigrants but because, as Rebecca said: “It’s not right that we give all the money to Europe, not when we have so many people going without in this country.”Shopworker Gary pointed into the scout hut: babbling boys and girls were filling their plates to the brim, while their parents enjoyed the luxury of not having to starve today.Did they really think that Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg would send any of those EU millions to this housing estate, to them and the other families relying on holiday handouts? “ ’Course not,” said Gary, shrugging. And the same went for everyone I asked that lunchtime.In one of the country’s biggest leave-voting regions, most people in this room had voted for the promises of Brexit, and yet had zero faith in them. They would believe the lying £350m bus, but not its fibbing, blond frontman. They accepted how bad things were, but they didn’t imagine for a minute that politicians would make it better.This is part of a far more complex, contradictory picture than you are normally given of working-class leave voters, and without it you can’t understand the forces shaping this election. I have spent years talking to such voters, whether in Colchester or north-east Derbyshire or Newbiggin or Blaenau Gwent. Different places, different histories, different politics. But there are a few common themes, particularly over Brexit and the political class. You rarely hear them on the Today programme or read them in the newspapers – yet, unless they get a proper ventilation, the decade-long crisis that Britain is mired in will stretch on for many more years.Second, while the political class define ancient history as what happened last week, voters remember that they have been waterboarded by crisis after crisis. Take Gary, who knew where this Brexit idend would end up: “It’s going to go to their mates in the City of London.” His remains perhaps the only reference I’ve heard to the financial sector in this entire election, yet it is being fought in the shadow of the 2008 crash and the cuts to the public realm and to our living standards that have followed.Remember that figure of £1.2 trillion? It was splashed across obedient newspapers as the Tory calculation of the cost of Labour’s spending splurge. It was also the amount the International Monetary Fund calculated that the UK stuck behind the finance sector immediately after the crash, in bailouts and loans and guarantees on City trading. Without so much as a by your leave the bankers were thrown a lifeline now deemed unaffordable for our public services.In 2008, good-hearted progressives were full of resolutions about “don’t let a good crisis go to waste”. Well, over the past decade we’ve had our fill of good crises: banking, MPs’ expenses, phone hacking. And the main message from all this has been that Britain’s key institutions are both unreformed and essentially unreformable.How do voters respond to that, especially those who have done least well out of the past decade? They tune out. Earlier this year I went door-knocking round a Northumberland housing estate with Jamie Driscoll, Labour North of Tyne mayor, and in what is called Labour’s heartland the most common response was: “I don’t follow politics”, followed by the slamming of a door. One canvasser remarked: “Policy doesn’t matter here. They’ve forgotten what government can do.” If there’s one statement Labour should take to heart after this election, it’s that.A month before the 2016 referendum I was in Pontypool. This south Wales market town used to be lovely. You could see that. But, as one local flatly remarked: “It’s dead now because they took what they wanted. Thatcher smashed the unions. There used to be coal mines. Boosh! ‘We’re out of here.’ They’ve moved on.” When the culture of Labourism got destroyed, so did the attendant affiliation to the Labour party. The Westminster lot were all “liars” and London was a leech, always hungry for more.This is what decades of distrust produces. Not magical thinking or unstinting belief in posh-boy fairytales, but a deep and sullen resentment. A nihilism that neither party nor any other democratic institution can even get their hands around, let alone find a response to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36440c73f63c76ab73e4eb5d62640471b804892e/0_150_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa2e4b320eb0b69410d9129001ce6f3","title":"the guardian view on myanmar and genocide humanity on trial","story":"Criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi’s defence of her country must not overshadow the issue at the heart of the case at the international court of justice: the ongoing suffering of Rohingya MuslimsAung San Suu Kyi’s decision to personally defend Myanmar in the genocide case at the international court of justice this week has torn away any scant remaining shreds of moral credibility from the figure once lauded as a champion of democracy and the fight against oppression. Yet what is at stake is far more than one woman’s reputation.Nor is this even about the six military leaders – including the commander in chief – who UN-appointed investigators last year said should be prosecuted for the “gravest” crimes against civilians, including genocide. This is about the more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine state forced to flee to Bangladesh since late 2016, the 10,000 who UN investigators believe may have died in the crackdown, and the 600,000 still living in apartheid conditions, denied basic rights.Lawyers for the Gambia, which has brought this case with the backing of the 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, laid out the details: the mass shootings, throat slittings, infanticide, torture, rape and burning down of villages, carried out systematically and together amounting to the destruction of the Rohingya as a group, in whole or part. These crimes are well documented.Even the Nobel peace laureate conceded that “it cannot be ruled out that disproportionate force was used by members of the defence services in some cases in disregard of international humanitarian law, or that they did not distinguish clearly enough between fighters and civilians”. But this did not, she argued, amount to genocide. She did not once use the term Rohingya.She dismissed the accusations against Myanmar as an incomplete and factually misleading account. (Though the “clearance operation” followed attacks by militant groups on security forces, all the evidence points not to a targeted campaign against insurgents, but a pogrom against a people who have suffered decades of discrimination.) She claimed that authorities had held troops to account – yet even when soldiers were jailed for the murder of 10 Muslim men in the village of Inn Din, they were released after less than a year, while two Reuters journalists who exposed the killings served more than 500 days.Her personal representation of Myanmar has dispelled any lingering hope that she was acting reluctantly as leader of the civilian government in a country where the military still call the shots. The rallies held to celebrate her advocacy reinforce the suspicion that this appearance is designed to boost her popularity ahead of 2020’s elections. And while she was defending her country in front of the UN’s highest court in the Hague, dozens of Rohingya – including 23 children – were in court in Myanmar for attempting to flee the misery.To prove genocide requires evidence of intent as well as of atrocities: the bar is high. Even if the court agrees to issue provisional measures to protect the Rohingya, the impact is unclear. The ICJ ordered such measures in 1993 two years later, 8,000 men and boys were massacred at Srebrenica. Myanmar’s generals are largely inured to international condemnation. But the reminder that there may one day be consequences for their actions could offer some deterrent to the worst abuses. It could also increase the pressure on the security council to take on the issue. China has received little scrutiny for its role in sheltering Myanmar. This case had to be brought, not only in the hope of offering some protection to the Rohingya, but because – as the court was reminded – what is on trial is not only the state of Myanmar but our collective humanity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71fbe87df6c107652ce9e7e1eb88c67df6aea76c/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c5664bf0dc9a08df5d439a790511947","title":"bering strait northwest passage arctic ice melts","story":"Melting sea ice is prompting fevered dreams of ever-easier access, and a renewed jockeying among Arctic nations for status, profit and ownershipI could not keep my eyes off the graves, could not stop staring at them even as I walked away, turning repeatedly to look over my shoulder at them as I slogged my way across the gravel-strewn shore of Beechey Island until they disappeared from view.It was profoundly saddening to contemplate their presence on a low-lying, windswept outpost of the Canadian Arctic, to imagine the fear and loneliness those buried here must have felt as they faced death in the harshest of conditions, thousands of miles and a world removed from their homes. And yet, they were the lucky ones, the first casualties of an expedition that vanished 173 years ago while searching for the fabled Northwest Passage between Atlantic and Pacific, whose remaining members met their doom after their ships became frozen in never-yielding sea ice, who perished one by one waiting for a summer that never came.Not until 1906 was the Northwest Passage eventually transited by ship the feat would not be repeated for nearly 40 years. Since then, as Arctic sea ice has rapidly dwindled, almost 300 transits have been made of the Passage, the bulk of them since 2007 24 took place in 2019. On this day, I arrived courtesy of that most modern of intrusions into remote areas: a passenger ship called the Ocean Endeavour, chartered by a company called Adventure Canada. What was once the graveyard of Victorian explorers is now a destination for any sufficiently adventurous and well-financed tourist.The Arctic is warming, and its sea ice is melting, prompting fevered dreams of ever-easier access, and a renewed jockeying among Arctic nations for status, profit and ownership.Journeying through the Passage over the best part of three weeks in September yielded the expected fruits of an Arctic journey. A passing ice floe hosted a polar bear seemingly just minutes removed from killing a seal, the victim’s blood leaving a crimson trail on the ice. A ersion into a bay revealed first a polar bear feasting on a beached beluga carcass, then another bear on an opposite cliff and then two more, and finally an abundance of harp seals and seabirds thrashing through the water as they feasted on a banquet of Arctic cod. We stepped on the low-lying beach of the tiny Jenny Lind Island, randomly named after a Swedish opera singer, and squinted through binoculars at musk oxen in the distance. We passed through the narrow confines of the Bellot Strait, its eponymous co-discoverer a French explorer who was blown off the ice and to his death in the freezing water below, the cliffs on its southern side marking the northernmost point of mainland North America.We encountered less than a handful of other ships: a Canadian coastguard icebreaker – which, a few weeks earlier, had deployed to help the Ocean Endeavour through some stubborn summer ice – and a pair of other passenger vessels. There was nothing, at any point in the journey, to suggest that this barely trafficked waterway might be at the heart of an international dispute, let alone the subject of multiple studies into its viability as a commercial shipping route.But covetous eyes gaze upon the Northwest Passage, more so as Arctic ice retreats establishing authority over the Passage proffers the prospect of establishing control over access, and there is no consensus as to where that authority lies.As far as Canada is concerned, there is no controversy over the matter. Citing among other things legal precedent and historic use – particularly a millennium or so of use by Inuit – Ottawa considers the Northwest Passage to be its internal waters. The United States, brandishing a different legal case and echoing its longstanding position on such matters elsewhere, counters that it is an international strait, “an area of high seas that connects two bodies of water which is open for peaceful use by a vessel from any state”.The dispute did not really flare up until the SS Manhattan, a US-flagged oil tanker, transited the Passage (with some difficulty) from east to west and back again in 1969, carrying a symbolic barrel of Prudhoe Bay oil on the return trip, accompanied by a US Coast Guard icebreaker, without seeking authorization. Ultimately, the two countries negotiated an Agreement on Arctic Cooperation, in which they effectively agreed to disagree on the matter. But as Arctic ice melts, so too does the veneer of friendly differences.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, argued in a fiery speech to the Arctic Council in May that “Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st-century Suez and Panama Canals”, and dismissed Canada’s claims to the passage as “illegitimate”. Of late, China – increasingly interested in the possibilities of Arctic shipping lanes and a relatively recently minted observer to the Arctic Council – has weighed in, last year publishing an official Arctic policy that, among other positions, gently echoed the American stance on the matter of access to polar passageways.That such disagreements are articulated at all is testament to the promise that the Northwest Passage is perceived to offer. That promise is perhaps best encapsulated in numbers: numbers such as 15,700 (the distance in kilometers from Yokohama to Rotterdam via the Passage) and 7,600 (the number of kilometers shorter that route would be relative to the Panama Canal), numbers that to some conjure a vision of the Northwest Passage providing a bustling corridor between Pacific and Atlantic and finally fulfilling a destiny centuries in the making.Queen Elizabeth is said to have waved from her palace window as Martin Frobisher set out on his first expedition to find the Passage in 1576, such was the import attached to establishing a trade route to the Pacific. But the history of the search for the Northwest Passage is a catalogue of incremental successes interspersed with misery and misfortune.In 1611, having mapped the river and the bay that are now named after him, Henry Hudson’s attempts to probe farther west into the ice and the unknown ended with his crew mutinying and sending him overboard in a lifeboat, never to be seen again. Eight years later, Jens Munk and his band of 65 men made it as far as Hudson Bay, and spent the winter near the mouth of Churchill River racked by cold, scurvy and probably trichinosis from eating insufficiently cooked polar bear meat, none bar Munk and two others survived to see the following spring.It was in such inauspicious footsteps that Sir John Franklin, and the 128 officers and men of HMS Erebus and Terror, followed as they sailed out of the River Thames on 19 May 1845 on the most ambitious and extensively equipped expedition to the Passage yet. Whaling ships spied them in upper Baffin Bay, just east of the entrance to the Passage, on 26 July and shortly thereafter the expedition vanished without trace.Subsequent searches turned up clues: the graves on Beechey Island, where the ships spent the winter of 1845-86 a note indicating that by 22 April 1848, the ships had been trapped in ice for over 18 months, Franklin and 23 others had died, and the remaining crew was setting out south across land in search of safety Inuit stories of starving white men who had died, one by one, in the snow.In 2008, the then Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, launched a major effort to find the wrecks of the Erebus and Terror. The goal of the search was not, wrote author Paul Watson in his book Ice Ghosts: The Epic Hunt for the Lost Franklin Expedition, purely historical or archeological rather it was “part of his strategy to mold public opinion”, with the Northwest Passage a powerful tool for “stirring Canadian nationalism in the twenty-first century”. Harper’s intent, Watson asserted, was to shore up support for a muscular assertion of Arctic sovereignty, laying claim “over a vast stretch of the Arctic seabed, straight up to the North Pole”.As the ice retreats, revealing a potentially resource-rich seabed below, Canada is not alone in its designs on the broader Arctic. In 2007, a Russian submarine planted a rust-proof titanium flag on the seabed at the North Pole, and in October of this year, Russia’s ministry of defense proclaimed that it had collected enough evidence to support its claims to much of the Arctic Ocean.Meanwhile, Denmark has laid down its own metaphorical marker, based on a claim that a large area up to and beyond the North Pole is connected to the continental shelf of Greenland – which, of course, the Trump administration earlier this year expressed a desire to buy. (That US interest recently prompted the Danish defense intelligence service to declare the island the country’s number one national security priority, ahead of terrorism and cybercrime).And while the 800 or so vessels that transit all or part of the NSR annually is hardly enough to threaten the approximately 15,000 that transit the Panama Canal each year, it is far ahead of the Northwest Passage.The Northwest Passage remains relatively narrow and relatively shallow, and even in a warming world its twisting straits remain vulnerable to blockage from the sea ice that breaks up and sweeps down from the Arctic Ocean. The Northern Sea Route, in contrast, has no winding narrows with which to contend there is essentially only the Russian coast to the south and the Arctic Ocean and its retreating sea ice to the north, and its waters are considerably deeper.For all the hype about its potential, for all the lives that have been lost and the ships that have been wrecked attempting to map its contours, for all the butting of diplomatic heads, it may well be not the Northwest Passage, but the Northern Sea Route that ultimately provides the Arctic pathway which so many have for so long desired.Harper’s Northwest Passage initiative did have some success. In 2014, searchers found the wreck of HMS Erebus three years later, they also found the almost perfectly preserved wreck of HMS Terror.Two years after that, I and others from the Ocean Endeavour stood on a barge and watched as underwater archeologists explored the nooks and crannies of, and retrieved artifacts from, the Erebus wreck below us. We were the first visitors to the wreck site, and the personal nature of some freshly retrieved artifacts was jarring. I looked at the shoe that one archeologist tenderly tended to and wondered who might have worn it, and how and when he died. What would he have thought of the notion that, almost 200 years after he set sail, the Northwest Passage would still exercise the thoughts of so many? Would he even recognize it? Certainly, on this day, with ice nowhere to be seen, it would have seemed very different from the horrible place in which he had been trapped, and in which his ship had sunk.I tried to imagine his hopes and aspirations, and the life he had lived on board, as I peered over the side of the barge and pictured the Erebus in its final resting place, in the dark, turbid waters beneath my feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cdd33fcc5f6ae6269fdbe9b77e254d87b7a69e8/0_172_5113_3068/master/5113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05328495f8f5cc0f1fd0e1cf2be429d2","title":"saving face eight tips for avoiding hangover skin this christmas","story":"Excess alcohol, lack of sleep and junk food can leave skin looking puffy, dull and dehydrated. Here’s how to mitigate the damageWhile “hangover skin” might sound like a party season bogeyman, or a made-up marketing term designed to tempt you into buying more products, after a month of late nights, almost exclusively beige food and – possibly – too much booze, a lacklustre, puffy complexion is as inevitable as a banging headache – and just as unappealing.As Dr Anjali Mahto of the British Association of Dermatologists points out, “the problem with party season is that it’s an entire season. The odd night out isn’t terrible for your skin, but sustained going out can definitely cause problems.” Fortunately, there are steps you can take to mitigate the damage – and not all of them involve buying more products.Alcohol is a diuretic, so you and your skin will quickly become dehydrated if you are knocking back the booze. Consider alternating alcoholic drinks with glasses of water to prevent your skin from getting parched. Ultra-sweet cocktails and sparkling wines are also not your skin’s friends – studies have linked sugar with an increase in wrinkles and a breakdown in collagen (a protein that affects skin elasticity).A late-night kebab is tempting, but bear in mind that salty food will make you more dehydrated. Mahto recommends having a proper meal before you go out, adding that vegetables with a high water content – think cucumber and broccoli – can help with hydration.There is one festive snack that could do your skin some good: “Nuts are high in fats that are good at effectively lining your stomach,” she says. Situate yourself beside the bowl of almonds, then.If you can’t face that, a water-free product such as Garnier’s Micellar Milky cleansing water (£6.99, 400ml) will allow you to remove makeup from the comfort of your bed.Thanks to the dehydrating effects of alcohol and salty foods, you may be accustomed to having a puffy face the morning after the night before. See Julianne Moore’s now infamous “sushi face” for reference – the actor avoids soy sauce the night before awards ceremonies for fear of her face puffing up.But you might be able to counter some of those effects. The jade roller tool might have received its fair share of derision having been championed by Gwyneth’s wellness brand Goop, but a few minutes in the morning spent massaging your face with one might actually help. Use upward motions for lymphatic drainage (de-puffing) and keep it in the fridge, for a cooling effect: “It’ll reduce the amount of surface blood vessels, so the skin won’t look so red and angry,” says Mahto. For a more low-tech version simply used your fingers.Dark, puffy circles under the eyes are one of the telltale signs of so-called hangover skin. Mahto recommends looking for an eye cream containing caffeine, which is believed to reduce swelling (cooled teabags to the eyes can have a similar effect), and products with hyaluronic acid, which acts as a sort of Polyfilla for fine lines. “For a period, you can create a slightly more awake appearance – but they are short-term, temporary fixes,” she says.

To give him his due, Quentin Tarantino is not going down without a fight. This is a director who prizes the actual projection of celluloid on large silver screens – and, in fact, one of the most enjoyable sequences in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood follows starlet Sharon Tate into a movie-theatre showing of the spy comedy The Wrecking Crew, in which she appeared opposite Dean Martin. From the lobby cards to the upholstery to the glittering beams of light, Tarantino offers a lovingly detailed homage to the act of film-watching as it was practised in late 1960s Los Angeles.Tarantino isn’t only interested in the big screen, though much of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is just as concerned with the industrial-scale production of the kind of TV shows that fuelled the everyday entertainment habits of Americans. (Tarantino, six years old at the time the film is set, would no doubt have soaked up countless shows like Bounty Law, the fictitious western serial of which Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the star.) Not only does Tarantino create superbly realised extended sequences of a real-life show, Lancer, in which Dalton has a guest-star bad-hat role he also films hilarious versions of TV ephemera: on-set interviews, commercial spots and the like.The symbiotic Hollywood connection between TV and film is spelled out in Dalton’s career quandary: should he stick it out in La La Land, or head over to Italy, Clint Eastwood-style, where a casting agent (Al Pacino) can get him work in spaghetti westerns. (Not Sergio Leone – Tarantino’s personal favourite, Sergio Corbucci, gets the namecheck here.) Tarantino’s connoisseurship ranges widely: we get a glimpse of the Joe Namath biker pic CC and Company, an encounter with Bruce Lee on the set of The Green Hornet (Tarantino got a lot of grief from Lee’s daughter Shannon for having his movie Lee first threaten and then get a kicking from Brad Pitt’s stuntman character), and shelves full of comics and merch of the era.Tarantino’s masterstroke, though, is to connect this Hollywood life with the Spahn ranch, the former TV set where the Manson family set up shop. It’s there where Pitt’s Cliff Booth, an acquaintance of the owner George Spahn (in real life notoriously pacified by sex with Manson’s female acolytes), confronts the family en masse, and realises their less than benevolent intent.For approximately the first two-thirds of the film, this is great stuff (the Bruce Lee scene aside, which is pretty funny even if it is a travesty). It’s that ending that in my view that lets Once Upon a Time in Hollywood down. Tarantino’s predilection for wish-fulfilment rearrangement of history has let him down before – surely I can’t be the only person who sees the ending of Inglourious Basterds, when Hitler and Goebbels are murdered in a cinema, as just as tasteless as – SPOILER ALERT – Booth and Dalton’s offing of Manson’s crew of murderous hippies, slasher-movie style. Certain critics have panned Tarantino’s view of the hippie era as regressive – that is certainly the case, but he is entitled to his point of view. It’s the boneheadedness of thinking it’s fine to replace harsh reality with glib film-nerd narratives that means this film is only good, rather than great."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37d247721d3c475c7ce4b578a8b0e5e05182c78b/42_0_2585_1552/master/2585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0165a0365570331f330276bd7a36901","title":"every michael bay film ranked","story":"Will the director’s latest effort, 6 Underground, a vigilante revenge thriller starring Ryan Reynolds, match the bombastic grandeur of the rest of his oeuvre? And which Transformers film was the least bad, anyway?You can tell that this was Michael Bay’s final Transformers film. It’s basically a compilation of every bad idea the man has ever had. There’s King Arthur. Stanley Tucci is Merlin. There’s a sexy Oxford professor called Viviane Wembley. It’s heavily implied that planet Earth was a great big Transformer all along. Everyone hated this film, even the idiots who went to see the other four.The second Transformers film is unintelligibly stupid. Visually and narratively, it is the equivalent of locking yourself in a wardrobe with a million alarm clocks and then tipping yourself down a staircase. It is a long, embarrassing, self-serious mess. Worst of all, it features two characters – called Mudflap and Skids – who are almost certainly the most offensive racial stereotypes ever to hit the silver screen in robot form.I paid money to watch The Island in a cinema 14 years ago, and I am still furious about it. Ewan McGregor is wasted as a clone trapped on – that’s right – an island. However, the real crime here is Scarlett Johansson playing a character so one-dimensionally sexualised that she may as well be an airbrushed picture of a sports car. A small contingent is starting to claim that The Island is Michael Bay’s masterpiece. It isn’t.After Dark of the Moon, Bay and Shia LaBeouf said they were done with the Transformers franchise. And yet Bay returned almost immediately with this monstrosity, dragging Mark Wahlberg into the lead. As always, this is an indecipherably bad film, the only memorable aspects of which are Wahlberg’s apparent attraction to the actor playing his daughter and the inexplicable presence of Stanley Tucci.If this was a list about any other director, then Pearl Harbor would be last. A film that heavily borrowed the “lovelorn romance against the backdrop of a real-life disaster” formula from Titanic, only to mash it beyond all recognition with a pair of dumb ham-hands, Pearl Harbor was an absolute disaster from start to finish. It is, nevertheless, one of Bay’s Top 10 films.The first Transformers film rode the wave of childhood-destroying franchise reboots, and was tonally and visually incomprehensible to boot. The robots lacked definition, the Shia LaBeouf scenes felt half-finished, the camera letched over Megan Fox to such a harrowing degree that you felt the need to hose yourself down by the time the credits kicked in. It was terrible, but it is also the second-best Transformers film.A huge disappointment after the success of Bad Boys (although not financially because it did almost double the original’s box office). Bad Boys II saw Will Smith and Martin Lawrence twisting in the wind, trying to recapture the magic of their double act through a script that is cartoonishly problematic in its depictions of gender and race. This film would never get made today, thank God.To call something the least-bad Transformers movie is to damn it with the faintest praise imaginable, but here we are. This isn’t the best film in the series because of the plot – I’ve seen it more than once and, honestly, I wouldn’t be able to tell you what happened if you put a gun to my head – but for its technical prowess. The entire film was shot on 3D cameras that had to be designed to Bay’s specifications. At least there’s that.After five Transformers films, each more stupidly large than the last, Bay wanted a change of pace. He wanted to slow things down, tell a real story and maybe win an Oscar. The result was this, a film based on a true story that nevertheless stars Jim from The Office looking like a walking human growth hormone. Had any other director tried this, it would have at least contained a modicum of intelligence. It did get nominated for an Oscar, though, for best sound mixing.Armageddon tells the story of a bunch of roughneck miners (and Ben Affleck) who are sent into space to explode an asteroid heading to Earth. This was Bay’s third feature film, but it already bore plenty of defining traces especially the editing, which appeared to have been performed by an octopus having a seizure. Roger Ebert called Armageddon the worst film of 1998. It is Michael Bay’s fourth-best film.In his first non-Transformers film for almost a decade, Bay recruited the two stars with broad enough shoulders to carry his shtick. Wahlberg and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson are perfectly cast as a pair of musclebound knuckleheads whose terrible rampage of crime and violence is, incredibly, based on a true story. It’s a horrible story played for laughs imagine Scorsese trying to make Goodfellas after having had a grade-three concussion and you are in the ballpark.Bad Boys was instrumental in helping Will Smith to world-conquering status. After dabbling in middlebrow fare such as Six Degrees of Separation and Where the Day Takes You, this is where Smith cranked up his charisma as far as it would go and watched the money roll in. It’s stylish and lightweight – a perfect first film for Bay – and it’s telling that it’s this film that Smith is returning to now his career has taken a nosee. A very belated third instalment is due next year.This isn’t just the best film that Bay has ever directed (finally, Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage together!), but perhaps the most notorious. A fake intelligence source ripped off parts of this film for a 2002 chemical weapons program dossier, meaning that The Rock is probably directly responsible for Britain’s participation in the Iraq war. Not bad for one of the stupidest movies ever made.6 Underground is released on Netflix on 13 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15dda87641ea17848103cf83d9ab0f1b9371be5a/0_262_4039_2424/master/4039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b194813867a3d3c3c8e6e5cd344331bf","title":"firm raises 180m to build hollywood style film studio in uk great point media","story":"GPM close to site deal as UK struggles to keep up with demand for film and TV spaceA media investment firm that has bankrolled shows including Line of Duty has raised $180m (£136.6m) to fund new films and TV series and intends to build a Hollywood-style studio, as the UK struggles to keep up with the demand for production space.London-based Great Point Media (GPM), which recently partnered with the Hunger Games-maker Lionsgate to build a $100m studio complex in Yonkers, New York, is close to a deal on a site to build at least one large-scale studio in the UK.GPM has raised $100m from the US institutional fund manager MC Credit Partners, adding to the $80m it has already raised, with the aim of pushing its media investment war chest to half a billion dollars in the next 18 months.“We are experiencing a golden era in the UK’s creative industries,” said Jim Reeve, the chief executive of GPM. “Competition is fuelling demand for more original content from film studios, TV companies and other platforms like the streamers. However, there is still a massive shortage of studio space to cater for this. We want to play a leading role in the development of more studio space and the production of more quality content, not only in the UK but also across Europe and North America.”GPM is in the process of assessing seven potential sites to build film and TV studios in the UK, US and Europe. The UK is in a race to keep up with demand for studio capacity to cope with the increasing number of productions being filmed each year. Last year, more than 200 films and 120 high-end TV shows were made in the UK with a total production spend of more than £3bn.Earlier this month Sky unveiled plans to build a large-scale studio complex north of London to cater for its growing pan-European production needs, as well as those of NBCUniversal, which owns The Fast and the Furious maker Universal Studios. Both are owned by the US pay-TV giant Comcast.Earlier this year Netflix struck a deal to set up a permanent production base at Shepperton, home to films including Alien and Mary Poppins Returns.

Additional money, she said, would be set aside for anyone who did not accept the terms of the settlement. The agreement, which would be limited to $500,000 a person, would require court approval that is unlikely to come before the spring.The Weinstein Co is currently proceeding in bankruptcy court, where any deal would face review.The discussion of the deal revealed by lawyers a day earlier arose during a hearing in Manhattan pertaining to a lawsuit filed against the company and the disgraced movie mogul by the former Weinstein consultant Alexandra Canosa.Canosa, who has not joined the proposed settlement, has alleged that Weinstein on multiple occasions from 2010 to 2017 raped, sexually abused, intimidated and harassed her during what he maintained were business meetings in New York, Los Angeles, Malaysia and Budapest.Scores of women have accused the movie mogul of sexual misconduct. He has denied nonconsensual sex allegations. He faces a 6 January trial on rape and sexual assault charges in state court, where he has pleaded not guilty.Engelmayer agreed that depositions needed before a trial in Canosa’s case against Weinstein could wait to be taken until several weeks after his criminal trial ends. The testimony would include questioning of Canosa and Weinstein by lawyers in the case as they prepare to present evidence to a jury.Canosa’s lawyer, Thomas Giuffra, said outside court that the vast majority of women who have sued Weinstein were agreeing to settle because their cases were weakened by allegations so long ago that the statute of limitations would apply.“They’re getting a half-million for an out-of-statute case,” he said.Canosa, he said, was determined to fight on. At least two other women were doing the same, he added.“They assumed we would just go along with the herd,” he said of other lawyers. “She’s the most courageous client I’ve ever had.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca1b95a21b621e46aa5faf2898905146d7f31cc0/0_181_2836_1701/master/2836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcbcaab8d370c3f4ed1dd8df030ba429","title":"manchester united az alkmaar europa league match report","story":"Mason Greenwood had a night to remember as Manchester United dismantled AZ Alkmaar’s challenge with a barrage of second half goals. The 18-year old-striker scored two of them and won a penalty for another as Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side cantered to victory in their final Europa League game.For 45 tortuous minutes such a free-scoring spectacle had appeared the last thing the evening might produce, but once United broke the deadlock their opponents capitulated alarmingly and Solskjær’s experimental selection was fully justified. The United manager can do no wrong at the moment, and though at first this encounter looked as though it might interrupt his sequence of wins it ended up the most emphatic of his three in a row.All the more surprising because the first half, at least, had been firmly at the tepid end of the European spectrum, with barely enough entertainment or excitement to reward spectators who had braved the cold and rain.United spent the first half hour trying to convince their opponents they were relaxed enough to pass the ball around in their own penalty area, yet with several new faces in the back line they never had much chance of succeeding. Ashley Young was lucky to get away with one turn too many in front of his own goal in the early stages, and on a couple of occasions the reserve goalkeeper Sergio Romero looked less than comfortable with the ball at his feet.Solskjær’s players expected to be more dominant here, after failing to manage a shot on target in the drawn game in Den Haag, but though Andreas Pereira brought a save from Marco Bizot as early as the sixth minute United were content to let their visitors do most of the initial attacking. With both teams qualified, the only issue at stake was which one would top the group, and all United had to do to achieve that was avoid defeat, so it was perhaps no surprise that they began at a slower tempo than they normally prefer with Anthony Martial alone and frequently isolated up front.The obvious danger was Alkmaar sneaking a goal, which they almost did towards the end of the first half when Oussama Idrissi’s hopeful prod into the penalty area went through a crowd of players and rolled wide by inches. The slightest touch by anyone in black would have produced a goal, but United survived and continued to live dangerously, with Dani de Wit and Calvin Stengs going close but not quite close enough before the interval.It took over half an hour for a home attack of any real conviction, Juan Mata sending Young galloping down the right and moving into the area to accept the return, only to finish rather tamely with a shot that was cleared before it reached the goalkeeper.Alkmaar came up with a glorious chance to take the lead right at the start of the second half after Fredrik Midtsjo had powered away from James Garner in midfield. When a low cross was whipped in from the left Stengs was in a perfect position to meet it on the six-yard line, but though he kept his effort on target he put it far too close to Romero. United countered with some neat footwork from Mason Greenwood to set up a shooting chance for Martial, only to see the striker shoot high over the bar.Finally, in a move that featured several moments of quality that seemed to have been borrowed from another game, United took the lead just before the hour. First a dainty backheel from Pereira bamboozled a couple of defenders who thought they had him trapped by the corner flag. Mata took over and returned the ball to Pereira, who gave it back to find Mata still onside for a cross that eluded everyone in front of goal but was gratefully scooped into the net by Young, arriving at the far post at just the right time.That probably saved United the trouble of sending on reinforcements from the bench, and any thoughts Alkmaar might have had of doing the same were tempered by another home goal within five minutes of the first. The Swiss referee was perhaps lenient in concluding Garner had dispossessed Midtsjo cleanly – the AZ midfielder was booked for protesting he had been fouled – but when the ball ran free to Greenwood the teenager stuck the ball in the net from the edge of the D rather than join in the argument.All Alkmaar’s resilience suddenly evaporated. A rash foul by Jordy Clasie on the rampaging Greenwood allowed Mata to add a third from the penalty spot, and when Greenwood cut in from the right to reach a Mata pass for his second goal of the evening a hitherto stolid game had been enlivened by four goals in a matter of 11 minutes. While the arrival of the experienced Ron Vlaar put an end to United’s scoring, the feelgood factor at Old Trafford lives on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09602fca069734e19934cb64f6415a676b044305/0_150_2588_1553/master/2588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d8b995b9ed3f46abe01757863ac04c4","title":"standard liege arsenal europa league match report","story":"If Arsenal could translate their spells of distilled attacking brilliance into anything approaching a full performance, this could yet be some team.They swamped West Ham with three goals in nine minutes on Monday and here they were lucky to escape with a draw against Standard Liège, eventually thanking Bukayo Saka, the 18-year-old wide player, for superbly assisting Alexandre Lacazette and then scoring a fine equaliser. The goals came within 180 seconds of each other late in the second half, cancelling out deflected strikes from Samuel Bastien and Selim Amallah. With a considerable slice of help from Guimarães, who won dramatically against Eintracht Frankfurt, they ensured Arsenal finish top of Group F and it means they will avoid potentially awkward encounters with Internazionale or Ajax, among others, in the last 32.From the beginning it was clear this would be a character-building test for Freddie Ljungberg’s team, composed largely of fringe players. Standard, defeated 4-0 in the reverse fixture, are a different proposition at home and had their own designs on progress. Three points and a failure for Eintracht would send them through and the home fans, massed in steep, severe stands behind either goal, did their best to create the kind of environment that might cow the less experienced among the visitors’ ranks.The bitter cold and harsh wind in a partly open-cornered venue contributed to that too, along with On a patchy, bobbly playing surface that demanded every pass be played with added care.So it was no surprise that what followed was scruffy and low on quality.Cluj booked their place in the knockout stages by defeating a makeshift Celtic side in Romania. Second-half goals from defender Andrei Burca and midfielder Damjan Djokovic inflicted Celtic\u0027s first Group E defeat.Neil Lennon\u0027s side had already secured top spot in the group, so the manager made a number of changes, with 18-year-old Scott Robertson starting in midfield, and 16-year-old Karamoko Dembélé came on as a late substitute.Following an untidy first half, Dan Petrescu\u0027s side took the lead from a corner as Burca headed home. Djokovic swept the ball home after 70 minutes, with Craig Gordon making late saves to keep the scoreline respectable.Scott Robertson made his debut and had a terrific debut. For such a young player he showed such maturity and composure. My only criticism is I thought we were very passive at the start of the second half, and I\u0027m disappointed to lose a goal from a set play.Eintracht Frankfurt handed top spot in their group to Arsenal, conceding two late goals to bottom side Vitória. In Group C,\u0026nbspGetafe\u0026nbspwon their eliminator against Krasnodar 3-0, with all three goals coming in the last 15 minutes.\u0026nbspBasel\u0026nbsptopped the group after a 2-0 win over Trabzonspor.In Group A,\u0026nbspApoel\u0026nbspsurprised Sevilla, winning 1-0 in a game between two teams who had already qualified. In Group D,\u0026nbspLASK Linz\u0026nbspgrabbed top spot from Sporting with an emphatic 3-0 win, while PSV and Rosenborg drew 1-1.Malmö\u0026nbspgot the win they needed in a cross-border derby at\u0026nbspCopenhagen, who still crept through after Dynamo Kyiv were held at home by Lugano. Elswhere, two goals from Joris Gnagnon earned\u0026nbspRennes\u0026nbspvictory over Lazio, ending the Italian\u0027s faint hopes of progress.Neither team found it easy to retain possession for long but, when Arsenal did, they created the moments best approximating to excitement. The first, in the 14th minute, saw Emile Smith Rowe lose his man cleverly after taking Lacazette’s slick pass, surging into the space he had created and, from an angle on the right, forcing Arnaud Bodart to ert the ball wide with a toe.The home keeper made a similar stop from Saka before the half-hour after a patient buildup on the other flank and, as the interval neared, parried again from the Arsenal left wing-back before ing on to Reiss Nelson’s follow-up header. Saka had been deployed in that position, in which Ljungberg has used him for the club’s under-23s, as one of nine changes from the side that beat West Ham. In another of Ljungberg’s switches Konstantinos Mavropanos had his first senior action of the season and it was from the Greek centre-back’s mistake that Mehdi Carcela shot straight at Emiliano Martínez in the home side’s most dangerous moment of the half.Mavropanos had been trying to play out from the back and, in so doing, appeared to catch the same bug that has infected his colleagues at various points in the season. These were hardly conditions conducive to precision football and that was perfectly evident in the performance of Standard, who were brisk and willing but short on real menace. Their only other real moment of first-half threat saw Sokratis Papastathopoulos act more decisively than his compatriot had, blocking from Renaud Emond, the rangy centre-forward, after he had found a good shooting position.Standard had, in short, not looked like scoring but they changed the game’s complexion within two minutes of the second half. Bastien was subjected to little pressure as he advanced to the right of central midfield and, from 22 yards, decided to try his luck. His meaty strike did not look especially harmful until it took a hefty ricochet off Papastathopoulos, which removed much of its sting but sent the ball spinning agonisingly beyond Martínez, who had committed and could not adjust to the change of direction in time.The celebrations were lusty but in practice the goal altered little for Standard. Eintracht’s short-lived lead over Guimarães meant their hopes of going through were fading. But the combination of the two scorelines gave Arsenal a headache. They did not manage much in the way of an instant response, instead finding themselves caught ahead of the ball several times on the break and counting themselves fortunate that Standard lacked the quality to work a killer opening.A determined run to the byline by Smith Rowe, who showed some fine touches throughout, brought no reward and the second goal that had been vaguely threatened came shortly afterwards. It owed much to more sloppy work inside their own box, Joe Willock this time presenting the ball straight to Amallah. Once again a deflection did the work, a snick off the unwitting Mavropanos beating Martínez.Arsenal’s non-display since re‑emerging had got what it deserved at that point. But their capacity to perplex knows no bounds. When Lacazette headed in Saka’s excellent cross from point-blank range, in their first really threatening moment of the half, their tails instantly went up. It took only another three minutes for Saka, manoeuvring across the box before whipping a right‑footed effort across Bodart, to restore respectability. News of Guimarães’s lead buoyed Arsenal and brought loud exhortations from the Standard fans but in the end Ljungberg’s team were the ones departing in satisfaction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc504c996723fcd33fc5831b01a4cd002aee6d19/140_346_4179_2508/master/4179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=615254a1e43bee46fa3433bc8217f7fc","title":"standard liege v arsenal and more europa league live","story":"Manchester United and Wolves ran riot in the second half as every British team progressed to the knockout roundsRight, I’m checking out. Election results are about to start coming in, and I have a lot of weeping to do. Bye!Gerrard also says that “something’s imminent” on his contract. “It’s down to the club to announce it when they’re ready.”Steven Gerrard is about as downhearted as a chuffed person could be:I’m very pleased. I think we certainly deserve it. I don’t think we were good tonight, in the second half. We created enough chances to have a bigger advantage, even at the end. I thought we stopped doing what we’re good at in the second half, which is either finding space or keeping the ball, and then it was just wave after wave, and it was direct, first balls and second balls. Credit to them, they never gave up. We didn’t expect them to. These were the dark horses in the group. A very difficult group, so credit to the boys getting out. Let’s give credit where it’s due, this club’s suffered a lot. It’s the first time we’ve had knockout football in Europe since 2011. This is another step in the right direction. I’m very pleased, I’m very proud but I won’t overcelebrate.Ewan Murray was at Ibrox. Here’s his report:Given nothing attached to the Old Firm can be viewed in isolation, it was impossible to ignore a sense of redemption as Rangers - eventually - wandered into the Europa League’s last 32. The harrowing circumstances of a League Cup final defeat to Celtic just days earlier was - briefly at least - forgotten as Steven Gerrard delivered yet another indicator of progress at Ibrox. This marks the first time since season 2010-11 that Rangers have featured in Europe beyond Christmas. If ending Celtic’s domestic stranglehold is key to perceptions of Gerrard’s tenure, delivering returns on other fronts is wholly welcome, not least from a financial perspective.Much more here:Paul Doyle was at Molineux. Here’s his report:Diogo Jota ensured Wolves finished their group campaign in style, springing from the bench to plunder a hat-trick in 12 minutes. Leander Dendoncker also found the net as Nuno Espírito Santo’s men blew away Besiktas with a powerful second-half performance.Wolves’ ability to play like this even without several regular starters is one of the reasons why they can be confident of advancing further in this competition no matter whom they are pitted against in Monday’s draw for the knockout stages.Much more here:Paul Wilson was at Old Trafford. Here’s his report:Mason Greenwood had a night to remember as Manchester United dismantled AZ Alkmaar’s challenge with a barrage of second half goals. The 18-year old-striker scored two of them and won a penalty for another as Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side cantered to victory in their final Europa League game.For 45 tortuous minutes such a free-scoring spectacle had appeared the last thing the evening might produce, but once United broke the deadlock their opponents capitulated alarmingly and Solskjær’s experimental selection was fully justified. The United manager can do no wrong at the moment, and though at first this encounter looked as though it might interrupt his sequence of wins it ended up the most emphatic of his three in a row.Much more here:All the final scores:All of which means that every British side in European competition this season has progressed through to the knockout stages of whatever competition they entered. Truly, this nation just keeps covering itself in glory. What? Oh.It’s all over! Rangers are in the knockout stages as the runners-up in Group G!A second booking for Ryan Jack, and Rangers must negotiate the final 90 seconds of stoppage time with 10 men!Wolves win the game, but meanwhile Paulinho has made it Slovan Bratislava 2-4 Braga in the last minute, so the Portuguese side will win the group.Manchester United win the game, win Group L and will go through to the next round as one of the seeds!An almighty scramble ends with Young Boys equalising, and suddenly Rangers are a goal away from disaster once again!Nikola Vlasic, once of Everton, has made a late breakthrough for CSKA Moscow at Eyol. It’s 0-1 there now.Greenwood cuts inside from the left, decides he’s quite up for a hat-trick and lets fly, but his shot flies wide, and also high, of goal.Alkmaar were really very good for the best part of an hour at Old Trafford. Then the world emphatically crumbled around their ears, and they went from 0-0 in the 53rd minute to 4-0 in the 64th, since when they’ve been staggering about the pitch in a daze.Goals just keep on coming in batches tonight. The latest pair have come in Belgrade, where Sadiq Umar put Partizan 4-0 up in the 76th minute and the highly-rated 18-year-old centre-back Strahinja Pavlovic took a few pounds off his asking price with an own-goal four minutes later. There’s all sorts going on in Bratislava, where Khadfi Rharsalla gave Slovan a 2-1 lead over Braga in the 70th minute, Francisco Trincao equalised in the 72nd - the 19-year-old’s first senior goal - and a Vasil Bozhikov own-goal put Braga ahead in the 75th! This means that Braga lead Group K by a point, ahead of Wolves.In other news, Paulo Otávio has put Wolfsburg ahead against Saint-Etienne. He did it 15 minutes ago, but this is the first chance I’ve had to tell you about it. They nevertheless remain second in Group I, behind Gent. The Belgians though now lead only 2-1, Denis Miroshinichenko having pulled one back for Oleksandriya. That is a ludicrous goal rush at Wolverhampton and Manchester. Calm down, lads, I’ve got some catching up to do.Leander Denoncker finally gets his goal, heading in a right-wing corner in the 67th minute. Then two minutes later Pedro Rebocho tries to do a fancy trick on the left flank and is dispossessed, the ball’s crossed in and Jota converts for his hat-trick, completed within 13 minutes of him entering the fray!Another one! Mata passes to Greenwood, just to the right of the penalty area, and he cuts into the box before shooting low and just inside the near post!Greenwood is bundled over by Clasie in the penalty area, as clear a penalty as you’re ever going to see. The keeper goes the right way, but Juan Mata’s penalty goes into the right-hand corner anyway!They’re not denied for long! Dendoncker, from 30 yards, produces a shot massively superior to either of the ones he mustered when facing an empty net, the keeper fingertips it into the post and it rebounds into the path of Jota, who slams it in! Jota only came on in the 56th minute, and he’s got two!Wolves hit the post! From a left-wing corner the Besiktas keeper roars off his line again and gets nowhere near it, thus presenting Dendoncker with another open goal, which once again he misses. This time he hits the meat of a post, though, so he’s getting closer.Midtjso gets booked for complaining about the tackle, which on replays does look quite a lot like a foul.Fredrik Midtsjo wins the ball on his right wing and embarks on a ludicrously misguided jog infield, which ends when he’s bang central, 10 yards outside his area, and James Garner tackles him. The ball rolls to Greenwood, who takes one touch and then hits a low left-footer into the corner! Breakthrough at Molineux! A nice flick from Cutrone on the halfway line, brilliant work by Jimenez on the right, and Jota converts at the back stick! Pereira brilliantly skills his way past two opponents at the left-hand corner flag, backheeling to Mata. He gives it back and Pereira slides infield to Matic, whose first-time ball from just outside the box picks out Mata, who has been busy cutting into a congested penalty area from the left. The Spaniard controls and slides across goal, and though Martial hasn’t anticipated it, meaning the ball rolls across goal without anyone tapping it in, Young pops up well beyond the far post to thunder it into the roof of the net from an acute angle!You’ve got to say, that is an absolute ripper.And a chance for Manchester United! Greenwood passes infield from the right to Martial, who has time to control and then shoot, but somehow he contrives to shoot over the bar!Chance for Wolves! A totally bonkers miss, really, from Dendoncker, who was picked out with a cross from the left. The keeper roared off his line for absolutely no good reason, and any kind of header on target would have gone in, but somehow Dendoncker’s effort went away from goal rather than towards it, and Besiktas clear.Chance for AZ! Idrissi’s low cross from the left seemed to miraculously evade several United legs on its way to Stengs, who is probably as astonished as everybody else that the ball found its way through to him, and erts it too close to Romero. The players are on their way back out. Wolves’ are all lined up on the touchline, presumably as part of a half-timely warm-up routine and not because they’ve all been subbed.A full run-down of your half-time scores:The half-time whistle goes at Old Trafford, where it’s goalless at the break, and it’s a simlar story at Wolves.After forty-one minutes without a goal, there have been two in three minutes in Bratislava, where Slovan took the lead through Andraz Sporar in the 42nd minute and Rui Fonte equalised in the 44th. They do seem to be coming in clusters today.“Nice to see Matic getting a run out,” writes Matt Dony. It is his first start, or indeed appearance of any sort, since United last played AZ, back on 3 October. “He can play himself into some form, and hit the ground running for Spurs in January when Mourinho inevitably buys him.”There are a couple of goals I haven’t told you about, both scored by German teams. Marcus Thuram has given Borussia Monchengladbach a 1-0 lead at home to Istanbul Basaksehir, and Danny Da Costa has equalised for Eintracht Franfurt against Guimaraes. Yet another goal at Porto, who have retaken the lead through Tiquinho. Rangers still lead the group, and every time I glance at the feed of their game they have just missed a great chance to extend their advantage.Astana already had the worst goal difference in the Europa League and it’s an honour they look determined to keep. They’re now 3-0 down at Partizan Belgrade, Takuma Asano with the third.The reason I say it’s all going on in Group G, incidentally, is that having been 2-0 up Porto conceded two goals in three minutes to get pegged back to 2-2 at home to Feyenoord, so had already lost group leadership even before Rangers scored. As it stands, Rangers have a three-point lead at the top!It’s all going on in Group G! Young Boys give the ball away and it’s immediately popped through to Morelos. Sörensen screams across to cut it out but makes a complete hash of it, and suddenly Morelos is entirely free! There’s not even anyone there to pretend to be fouled by, so he concentrates on the task in hand and slides a shot past the keeper!Jody Lukoki has put Ludogorets a goal up against Ferencvaros. According to Wikipedia his nickname is The Son of the Wind. I like this nickname. It certainly beats Keano or Gibbsy.Another Roma player has scored, though Umar Sadiq is on loan at Partizan Belgrade, and has put them 2-0 up against Astana in the other game in United’s group.At Ibrox, the now familiar sight of Morelos tumbling inside the penalty area, and a referee completely ignoring him. Then he’s played through on the right side of the area, but his shot hits the goalkeeper’s legs.It must have been the flares in Glasgow, because visibility is now excellent. There have been no goals there, but elsewhere in Group G Luiz Diaz has given Porto the lead against Feyenoord, with the Portuguese side thus leapfrogging Rangers to the top of the group. And they’ve just scored again! That’s two in three minutes, the young left-back Tyrell Malacia putting into his own net. That leaves Rangers in second place, but potentially one goal from elimination.Laurent Depoitre has his shooting boots on tonight. Gent are now 2-0 up against Oleksandriya, and the former Huddersfield hitman has got them both.In Rome, Diego Perotti has given the home side the lead over Wolfsberger from the penalty spot! And as I type that Wolsberger equalise, thanks to Alessandro Florenzi’s own-goal!A goal in Group I, where Gent’s Laurent Depoitre has given them a seventh-minute lead over Oleksandriya, and thus placed them very much in the driving seat in the battle for group victory.

Banks has brought a defamation action against Cadwalladr personally.The ruling on Thursday by Mr Justice Saini concerns the meaning of statements by Cadwalladr in two public talks and the meaning of words in two of her tweets, which Banks argues were defamatory.During a talk in June, Cadwalladr stated: “We know that the Russian government offered money to Arron Banks.”Banks’s lawyers argued this meant there were strong grounds to believe he would assist the interests of the Russian government, against those of the British government, in exchange for that money.Cadwalladr’s lawyers had argued this meant there were reasonable grounds to investigate.However, the judge concluded that in the context of the entire speech it in fact meant there were “substantial grounds to investigate” whether Banks would be willing to accept such funds, in violation of prohibitions on foreign electoral funding.Saini reached a similar conclusion in relation to a tweet, in which Cadwalladr compared Britain’s response to concerns about Russian electoral interference unfavourably with that of Italy, where a public prosecutor has opened an investigation into links between politicians and Russian officials.Banks argued this meant “there was reason to believe” he had committed “criminal offences which had involved meeting Russian government officials”. But the judge disagreed, finding instead that it had a less serious meaning that “there is a proper basis to investigate whether Banks’s contact with Russia involved any criminal conduct”.During a Ted Talk in April, Cadwalladr said: “And I am not even going to go into the lies that Arron Banks has told about his covert relationship with the Russian government.”In a second tweet, she said: “I say he lied about his contact with the Russian government. Because he did.”Cadwalladr’s lawyers argued that both statements meant there were reasonable grounds to suspect he had lied about a secret relationship with Russia, and to investigate whether he had illegally accepted foreign funding during the referendum campaign. However, Saini ruled that these were statements of fact, rather than calls for any investigations.In drawing his conclusions Saini cautioned against an overly legalistic interpretation of the meaning of words in resolving legal disputes, and emphasised that the ordinary reader or listener would not minutely analyse possible interpretations of words like a libel lawyer.“Lawyers (and I include judges in that category) cannot resist turning any exercise where language is being considered into an exercise in construction of words,” he said.Transcribing the text of Cadwalladr’s public talks and extensively litigating the precise meaning of tweets “at times seemed to me to be more like arguments about the construction of a deed concerning the demise of a leasehold interest,” he complained.In a statement, the ’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, and the Observer editor, Paul Webster, said: “Carole’s brave reporting has made waves around the world, and given the public much more insight into the secretive ways some powerful people and organisations have sought to influence our democracies.“This case is a very worrying example of a wealthy person singling out an inidual journalist and using the law to stifle legitimate debate and silence public interest journalism.”A coalition of free press organisations, including Reporters Without Borders and Index on Censorship, called on Banks to withdraw the legal action.Tamsin Allen of the law firm Bindmans said on behalf of Cadwalladr: “The judge has made it very clear that the battleground in the dispute is electoral funding. We believe that reporting this issue is a matter of the highest possible public interest, and that an attack on Carole’s reporting is an attack on all journalists’ ability to report on how our elections and referenda are funded.”Banks’s solicitors, Kingsley Napley, did not respond to an invitation to comment. Banks has previously insisted he supports press freedom but would not tolerate false statements or “misrepresentation of the facts”. He has always maintained he made his money in the UK, and denied that Russian funding played any role in the Brexit campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7f8d16789161e5f9f4af64e2e9289a34ecb8078/0_73_2185_1310/master/2185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2b29b475bb377ce82cdb110988739ac","title":"how one woman saved our snacks from seagulls","story":"When Madeleine Goumas published a paper on keeping the birds at bay, it sparked a media frenzy. And some people were keen to share their own storiesHow often it falls to science in these darkened days to bring a much-needed glint of hope. And so to this summer’s case in point. Never mind the quest for unlimited green energy, or pollution-free air, or an elixir for life. This was a breakthrough so profound that coverage went global: at last, researchers had worked out how to stop seagulls stealing our snacks.Or at least how to deter them. In field work that was equal parts brave and foolhardy, Madeleine Goumas, a postgraduate researcher at Exeter University, ventured into the Hitchcockian danger zones that are British seaside towns. Armed with only a watch, a notepad, a pen and a bag of chips, she set about gathering data. It was not long before she had her conclusion: hungry gulls back off if you stare them out.It was not as categorical as that, of course, but let’s not trouble with details. It was a watershed moment: a small but potent sign that humans might win this war yet. Better still, that victory might come from understanding hungry animals and learning to live with them, rather than charging at them amid a salvo of profanities, or declaring, as Alan Amos, the mayor of Worcester city council did in 2017, that it’s time to “kill the bloody things”.Goumas has given the issue more serious thought. Having your food snatched from your hand while sauntering down the promenade is a problem that needs sorting, but demonising seagulls doesn’t help. Herring gulls are in decline and on the UK’s red list of Birds of Conservation Concern. “We should try and understand it from the animal’s perspective,” Goumas says now. “If you’re putting a lot of food out, of course they are going to come and try and eat it.”Her work is part of a greater effort to understand what attracts and repels seagulls. The thinking being, to bastardise the ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu, is that the better one understands the enemy, the better one is able to save one’s snacks. Goumas showed that gulls pay attention to where people are looking, in line with gulls swooping from blind spots. The information has immediate strategic value: “Put up a parasol, eat with you back to the wall, look around you,” she says.The seagull study was Goumas’s first published paper and the media attention was overwhelming. But amid the circus came a small flurry of emails from readers keen to share their own seagull stories. A woman from St Ives wrote about how she had once been housebound with a bad foot and, in the many idle moments trapped indoors, noticed a seagull nesting outside, which also sported an injured foot. She became enthralled and watched the bird for years. Much later, she spotted the limping bird again, and turned the encounter into a poem.“A lot of it is about attitude. Things are only a problem if you make them a problem,” says Goumas. “Not everyone is going to avoid having their food taken, but they can take steps to reduce their chances of it happening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ed6292976c84fbacd1b0328ccaad4b8a22c53e/0_367_4224_2535/master/4224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=739c1093c1da677cd0e84d323ff314c4","title":"what can we learn from london vagina museum","story":"From 12th-century carvings to 90s coy euphemisms, women and their sexual organs have been on a journey, and a new space invites further contemplation. Like: who would wear a pussy pendant?‘There’s nothing wrong with that word: it’s not a dirty word.” Sarah Creed, curator at the Vagina Museum in Camden Market, north London, is ending a story about a gynaecologist friend whose child at nursery was told it was inappropriate to say “vagina”. Obviously I know there is nothing wrong with it. But would I wear a pussy pendant, by the Dutch artist Denise Rosenboom, which are apparently flying off the shelves? Would I have Sam Dawood’s period sculpture in my house? (I can see that this is quite a philistine criterion for appreciating art). Or a model of the vulva, identifying all the parts?A lot of myths are busted in the opening exhibition, titled Muff Busters, at this new museum: what we tend to call the vagina is actually the vulva, for example. There is only one word that describes the whole kit and it was appropriated some centuries ago as an expletive. Discharge is not effluent, it is a sign of self-cleaning. The hymen is not like a wall that you punch through. Most moderately competent feminist adults will know all this, plus, you know, Google. Which is not to say that it doesn’t need saying rather, that there is something deeper going on here than the correction of an information deficit.“I think it’s very much part of this new generation’s experience it’s very normal to talk about vaginas and vulvas,” says Creed. “It’s great that that ethos exists. I’m an 80s child: even when I was a teenager, it was completely taboo.” I am a 70s child, and likewise. However, Emma LE Rees, author of The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History, recalls feminism’s second wave: “I’m 50, and I can remember my mum being really open and honest, to the point that I can remember bursting into tears when she told me about menstruation. Because it just sounded so horrible.”The drive to shroud the female pudenda in a mysterious disgust, to make it unsayable, is centuries old Rees was driven to write her book, which a male colleague predicted “wouldn’t get recognition, because sometimes even serious research didn’t get recognition”, by chance. She came across a Sheela na gig – carvings of naked women with exaggerated vulvas, dating back to the 12th century – on a church in Kilpeck, Herefordshire. On consulting a 19th-century guide book, she was informed that it was “‘a fool holding his chest open to show his heart’. There’s no way that’s what that figure was,” she says.Such acts of erasure are unremarkable from that century, or indeed, any other. More interesting is the pendulum swing in feminism: from the consciousness-raising days of the hand mirror and the torch, where examining your own apparatus was a political and communal act (there would have been no more purpose to doing it on your own than there would have been staging your own AA meeting) through that late-20th-century phase when sex was no longer political, because nothing was political. In theory, this was because we were post-postmodern our biology needed not be our destiny and therefore to go on a journey of awakening through your vulva would have been particularly droll. In practice, that meant vulvas going back in the closet. Today, the full beam of attention has returned and to know yourself anatomically is, again, political. It has become the gateway body part to other conversations. Some of them - period poverty, for instance – are timeless, but reanimated. Others – sex work, trans rights – go to the heart of what ides feminism today.That is not to say that feminism was not ided in the 60s it is just that, in the absence of social media, nobody noticed. In the broadcast journalist Emma Barnett’s book Period: It’s About Bloody Time, she pieces together feminism’s relationship with the body. Barnett was, of course, concentrating on periods, rather than the more generic place-periods-come-out-of, but the principles were the same. That early radicalism – Germaine Greer telling women to taste their own periods – was not elaborated by the movement, because there was an equal and opposite force within the same generation of women: the equality wing of feminism.“What they were doing was trying to get us into the workplace,” says Barnett. So, she says, anatomy was “the last thing you’re going to bring up”. This is one of those obvious-sounding remarks that sets off a lightbulb in your head when I think of that generation, who were at the vanguard of the fight for professional equality, in both wages and opportunity, it is striking how hard-boiled they so often seemed about all aspects of the female experience. Miscarriage? Suck it up, happens to everyone. Childbirth? Back to work in 17 days. Period pain was for wimps a vulva was like a PowerPoint display, you should only bring it up if you’re going to use it in the next five minutes. I am not just beefing with my mother, by the way. This was all of them. I’m joking. (I’m not joking).So the gender-equality movement, whose wellspring was radical emancipation, did a handbrake turn back to pubic taboo when it had to make a choice between being accepted in the workplace now and enjoying a brighter, more open, more accepting tomorrow. It felt as though nobody really mentioned women’s bits seriously again until menstrual activism took off in the mid-00s, with avant-garde writers such as Chella Quint documenting a decade of periods, and the likes of artist Ingrid Berthon-Moine, who created a series of portraits of women using their menstrual blood as lipstick.What had happened in the interim was the post-postmodern 90s, when a lot of energy was concentrated on overcoming taboos around promiscuity. But there was a contradiction at the core of this: sex itself was a feminist act, especially if it was indiscriminate yet at the same time, we were extremely closed about female sexual organs, right down to what you called anything, or what anything looked like. “I loathe euphemisms,” Rees says. “Hoo hoos, vajayjays, lady gardens. But I don’t think the word ‘cunt’ can be reclaimed, either.” I agree, but I am interested: I don’t remember any adults using those coy synonyms before the 1990s and the swear word used to be 10 times ruder, friendship-endingly extreme.But tense silences never last for ever. Even without social media and selfie-awareness – the sense that self-acceptance is integral to one’s brand – we would inevitably have reached something beyond complete vulva omerta. Feminism has been on a whistlestop journey from ignoring the vulva to organising around it, and campaigns to end period poverty – often, like the climate strikes, starting at schools, although some, such as FlowAid, focused on awful deprivations endured by homeless women - make sense, even while I find them depressing. (It is such a failure of political empathy, that we would need such a graphic illustration of what poverty actually means before we can talk about it but that’s 2019, it’s nobody’s vagina’s fault). Contemporaneously, though, other fissures opened up, notably that of trans rights, in which there are certainly people on both sides who would have you believe that talking about anyone’s anatomy, in any context at all, is an insult verboten.Creed is comfortable on the territory: “We’re a trans ally, we’re an intersex ally. We’re LGBTQ+ positive. It’s not just women who menstruate,” she says. “Not everybody who has a vagina is a woman.” Her framing is different and it takes me a second to realise why: the current debate is fixated on, mired in even, what you need, physically, to qualify as a woman. Creed flips the perspective to “just because you have a vagina doesn’t mean you have to be a woman”, which lets in the experience of trans men (who, to my knowledge, are pretty much obliterated in the current debate, which is all about women-only spaces and, by inference, intrinsic male violence). This makes the question: “What do you need, biologically, to be who you are?” more complicated and thereby less heated.There has been a subtler attitude change to the vulva within some parts of feminism, which Creed explains, in precis. “Originally, there was a sense of reclamation: ‘This is mine, and it’s nobody else’s.’ But now, it’s more like: ‘This is mine, and also, I want to share it with you all.’ Not literally.”There is no reason that this should force the issue of sex work – still considered the pinnacle of male oppression in some quarters but an issue of solidarity for others – but it is unsurprising to me that Creed should bring it up. “Sex work historically was seen as for the pleasure of a man,” she says. “It’s difficult when you start there to build in a woman’s perspective.” It’s a judgment call, of course: you could perfectly easily create a vagina museum and still be anti-sex work. But once you reject the notion of the vagina as a mysterious space, you can no longer make the assumption that it is a site of oppression irrespective of whether or not the owner realises it in other words, there is no reason not to listen to sex workers.There is one thing about the vulva that has not changed, where the Vagina Museum explicitly sets out to move things on. Women still feel crap about themselves. “One thing that we look at is labiaplasty,” says Creed. “Between 2002 and 2012, it went up by 500 percent on the NHS.” One of the gynaecologists (and there have been a few) who has supported the museum said she had been working in this area for 20 years, had seen hundreds of labias in her time, and only one that was genuinely anatomically abnormal. So it is really mental distress people are just so upset with how they look. “Your vulva is like your face,” she continues. “There isn’t one look to go for. There is no ideal. But how can anyone know they’re not an outlier, if they’ve only seen their own?”Yet alongside all that self-hate, there is a playfulness that, I think, can not be explained by changing politics alone, or even at all the pussy pendants are flying off the shelves. “Who would wear a decorative vulva round their neck?” the third wave asks. “Who wouldn’t?” the fourth wave replies. All the merch and paraphernalia has this ludic, carefree subtext that the intensity of the 60s and 70s, and the squeamishness that came after it, could never have set out to achieve. You cannot strategise your way to self-acceptance or maybe they did and it just took a long time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27101c46ab2fa03b3eb8149dba399477f9a7ec91/0_1_2281_1369/master/2281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce6a2d47a33449a27d8075ce6f38948b","title":"beyonce has mastered this celebrity age as creator of worlds sayer of nothing","story":"In this era in which stars keep tight control of their publicity, Beyoncé’s offer to answer fans questions was refreshing – if the answers were ... not always clear-cutI need not remind you that we were forced to stare directly into the concept of Josh Brolin’s allegedly red-raw anus last week, so I think it is fair to say that we live in a brave, unheralded, fantastic new era of celebrity overshare. This, as best I can tell, is the third age. In the studio-contract, golden-age-of-Hollywood days, stars said basically nothing, sharing only titbits of their life via fanzine-level magazine features and newspaper columnist gossip items, and most of those were distributed by savvy studio heads, chomping six inches deep into a cigar while they did it. We only learned about all their threesomes long after they all died.Then a little loosening of the rules, some chum in the water: deep-e magazine profiles, rock stars saying outrageous things live on television, high-profile relationships and the monetisation of orce. Britain’s cottage industry for “posed paparazzi photos of someone in the despair of their life” is a particular guilty thrill of mine, which is why I love Arg from Towie so much. He provides a rolling feed of it, constantly either moving in or moving out of Gemma Collins’s house or being told by a doctor he is going to die if he doesn’t stop eating Toblerones in the bath, and there is forever a long-lens camera trained on him while he does it, thickly enacting what he thinks anguish looks like.But now we have Twitter, don’t we, and celebrities have full control over which angles of their personality they show and when, and we don’t need the magazine-PR-studio-head cycle: they just do an Instagram Live and casually announce a pregnancy they do a quote-retweet own on one of their stans who wobbles out of line. How far we have come, how much we have learned, how many times we have seen Arg’s joggers slip down as he puts a box of CDs with a plant pot on top into the back of someone else’s car.Beyoncé, though, defies all that, and fair play to her. In an interview with Elle this week, the singer took a number of questions from fans – these included: “What are you giving us with your partnership with Adidas?” said in that natural way fans have of asking their icons questions when they have literally one shot of doing so in their entire lifetime – and in doing so pulled off an astonishing prestige. Beyoncé did not shy away from the light of a single question she answered each one with politeness and life and rigour, yet also somehow said absolutely nothing at all and revealed nothing about herself. If you have any doubt that Beyoncé belongs in the same pantheon as the icons whose names ring out through history – Leonardo, Mozart, Michaelangelo, Picasso, Rodin – then hide that away now. She did this Elle interview with the gentle, precise, heaven-given touch of a master. She deserves a golden glow of light around her: Beyoncé, Creator of Worlds, Sayer of Nothing.Here’s Beyoncé on her confidence as a creator: “The more I mature, the more I understand my value. I realised I had to take control of my work and my legacy because I wanted to be able to speak directly to my fans in an honest way. I wanted my words and my art to come directly from me. There were things in my career that I did because I didn’t understand that I could say no. We all have more power than we realise.” I … what? I have read that over and over. I had a really good reading age at primary school that I assume has rolled forward into adult life. I’ve gone through that paragraph six or seven times. What does it say? What does it say?Or, Beyoncé, on her work process: “With new projects, I get my team together for a prayer. I make sure we are all clear on the intention and what the deeper meaning is. I do my best, and I try to push everyone around me to do the same. I eventually give everything I have. When it’s released to the world, I let it go because it is no longer mine.” There is a real “scene deleted” feel to the phrase “I do my best” there, isn’t there? Just to clarify: to make an album as world-changing as Lemonade you simply need to pray once, try hard, then let go of it for ever. That’s the creative process, yeah? That’s it? What have you said?Beyoncé, on whether she ever puts on a lowkey sweatsuit and goes for a walk sans security: “I do!” Beyoncé, on the last time she went to a supermarket: “It was more like a bodega before a Madonna concert.” Beyoncé, neatly side-stepping a question asking: ‘What do you do with your clothes after you wear them? I am certain you won’t wear them again. May I have them?’ with: “I think it’s important to have great basics that you can wear again and again.” And, most crucially, Beyoncé, on whether negative comments on the internet ever affect her: “Yes, I’m human. In moments of vulnerability, I try to remind myself I’m strong and I’m built for this.”I have never read a less compelling argument for being human than Beyoncé saying: “I’m human.” She must be something else. She is made of water and earth and air. She is made of a cosmic energy formed at the start of the universe itself. I refuse to believe that Beyoncé is just a person, made of blood and bones and skin, like the rest of you idiots. By this point, she is more a concept than anything else. She’s a concept, inside an Ivy Park x Adidas two-colourway boilersuit, delicately saying nothing at all with the precise and perfect touch of a maestro.Adam Driver eating a whole chicken. There, I said it. Adam Driver (you’re thinking about Adam Driver now, aren’t you? A leading man that they assembled out of sturdy wood and meat) eating a whole chicken (the rotisserie kind, the ones that go lurid orange as they rotate slowly on a spit, the ones with which you cannot help but get a thin, translucent layer of grease on your hands and around your mouth as you eat it). Adam Driver eating a whole chicken. That’s the story. That’s the news.Why do we know this? Because it’s Adam Driver season (he’s starring as unconvincing wall demolisher Charlie in Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, as well as unconvincing inner-turmoil-feeler Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), but the actor is secretive about his private life, so to get any sort of angle on him at all it is necessary to ask people who have known him or worked with him before he was a big lumpen pea-headed circus-boy megastar. Step forward Scott Aiello, Billions actor and Driver’s Juilliard classmate, who says Driver used to run across New York to attend classes then spend the entire day just really intensely eating a whole chicken to himself.“He would walk around school with an entire chicken in one hand and a jug of water in the other,” Aiello told the podcast The Film Reroll. “He would carry his roaster chicken with him and go to all his classes and consume chicken.” I cannot shake this image from my head. Adam Driver, gorging on a chicken leg teeth-first like Henry VIII at an execution gala. Adam Driver, getting his entire hand inside the carcass like a veterinary student and eating it like a sort of savoury candy floss. Adam Driver making lip-smacking eating noises while everyone else lies there in leotards trying to do sole-focus breathing exercises. I simply forbid this man from starring in any more movies. There has to be other leading men out there, ones without such imposingly wonky carnivorous energy about them. Find them, Hollywood. Find them now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c914ef1d269ab9726a01209e88ce2702c285d9/0_148_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d123a9f3cd36a3498b54bf10a018e2","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2020 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us coverAs 2019 comes to a close, we want to reflect on our journalism and look ahead to next year’s stories.

Jarvis Cocker and other leading lights recall a revolutionary scene‘Sheffield in 1977 had a slight feeling of being the city of the future,” recalls Jarvis Cocker. “I didn’t realise that it was all going to go to shit. It was Sheffield before the fall.”That pre-fall year is the starting point for a new box set: Dreams to Fill the Vacuum: The Sound of Sheffield 1977-1988. Familiar names appear – Pulp, Heaven 17, the Human League, ABC – but they are joined by a wealth of other acts, such as I’m So Hollow, Stunt Kites, They Must Be Russians and Surface Mutants, ning punk, post-punk, indie and electronic with that droll outsider energy particular to South Yorkshire.In 1977, Paul Bower was producing a local fanzine, Gun Rubber, and playing in the Buzzcocks-indebted 2.3. Like Cocker, he recalls the late-70s as being a time of optimism and flux. “There’s this myth of northern miserablism, that everything was shut down and shit,” he says. “But it wasn’t – that came later. It was a really interesting, bustling and creative time.”Sheffield had plenty of dirt-cheap “little mester” workshops, once used by master craftsmen working in the city’s cutlery industry, and these provided room for bands to move in and experiment. Bower’s band 2.3 shared a space with the Future, an early incarnation of the Human League that featured Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh along with Adi Newton before he formed Clock DVA. “We were enamoured with the New York scene,” says Ware. “In our own little way we were imitating the Exploding Plastic Inevitable.” Bower describes it as: “Andy Warhol’s Factory in the land of Bobby Knutt.”The pioneering industrial and electronic outfit Cabaret Voltaire had been active since 1973. “They were the godfathers of Sheffield’s new music,” says Simon Hinkler, who played in bands such as TV Product and Artery, as well as producing early Pulp. “You can’t overstate how important they were.” Ware echoes this. “They were our mentors,” he recalls. “Their methodology and lifestyle was something we aspired to. Not so much musically, but as a template for doing your own thing.”Cabaret Voltaire took on Western Works, another old cutlery factory, as their studio. While Ware looked to New York for inspiration, Cabaret Voltaire’s Richard H Kirk was more interested in Germany. “Kraftwerk and Can had their own spaces,” Kirk says. “We thought that was the perfect model. You could be there 247 without having to worry about the clock or some idiot engineer not knowing what to do with you.”“The environmental influences were very strong,” says Jane Antcliff-Wilson of I’m So Hollow. “Industrial and austere – steeped in working-class history. Imagination and vision were left to run wild in this bleak landscape.”By 1978, an explosive flurry of music was coming out of the city. “Punk was year zero and Sheffield really took that to heart,” says Cocker. “They said: ‘Right, we’ll invent the music of the future.’ The Cabs and the Human League really did do that.” It was enough for people to move to the city because of it. Jake Harries of the industrial punk-funk band Chakk was one. “This music didn’t sound like it came from anywhere else,” he recalls. “There was an otherness to it. Sheffield sounded like the place to be – it was electronic, strange and inspiring.”Not everyone warmed to peculiar new sonic explorations such as Cabaret Voltaire’s heavily deconstructed cover of the Beatles’ She Loves You. “This guy stormed out and physically grabbed me,” says Bower. “He’s screaming: ‘You’ve got to stop them. It’s sacrilege, they are destroying the Beatles.’ I said: ‘Yeah, that’s the point.’” Kirk thrived on the friction. “We went out of our way to pour petrol on the fire,” he says. “We knew people had never heard anything like what we were doing. It was meant to be confrontational.”The throbbing intensity of Artery’s live shows were as terrifying to some as they were thrilling to others Clock DVA got banned from venues after their first gig during one gig, I’m So Hollow were thrown off stage after just two songs. The debut Human League show went down surprisingly well, even if their new singer hadn’t mastered his role yet. “Midway through the gig, Phil Oakey walks off stage, straight through the audience with his high heels on,” remembers Bower. “Comes up to the sound desk and says: ‘How’s it going?’ I said: ‘Fine, Phil, but it’s traditional for the singer to stay on stage during the gig.’”Because of the conflict that would arise at shows, the Human League began performing with a Perspex shield around them. “Paul Morley wrote it was some extemporisation around alienation in contemporary society,” recalls Ware. “No, it was to stop skinheads gobbing on the synthesisers.”While pop stardom visited many, it seemed to evade one person. “The 1981 John Peel session Pulp did convinced me that I was going to be a teen star,” says Cocker. “But the 80s were depressing. The city was falling apart and our first album sold virtually nothing. I was crestfallen.” Violence was also an inescapable part of going out during this period. “It was like Pac-Man,” says Cocker. “You had to pick your route and avoid the beer monsters. Violence, or the threat of it, was a constant thing.” One night he had a pint glass land on his head on another he was beaten up for wearing a patent leather mac. “I put two fingers up at them thinking my bus was about to leave, but it wasn’t, so they just got on it and smacked me.”However, when the city was in sharp decline and the musical buzz of the early 80s was wearing off, Chakk did something crucial: “We signed with MCA and had them agree that we could build a recording studio out of our advance,” says Harries. FON Studio (named after a piece of local graffiti that read Fuck Off Nazis) was the result. Located in an old karate studio above a metal works, countless bands from across the UK recorded there. Richard Hawley’s teenage group Treebound Story was one. Rob Gordon, who would later co-found Warp records, found himself producing indie bands there in 1986 via a Youth Training Scheme. “It was obvious he was a genius,” recalls Hawley. “We were just kids but he made us sound amazing. He even tolerated us dropping acid, taking all our clothes off, playing the bongos and making a racket.”“It was a brave thing to do,” Cocker says of FON. “Sheffield was not going anywhere and it showed solidarity. They could have just taken the money and scarpered.” It was a combination of pride and practicality, according to Harries. “We thought it was crazy Sheffield didn’t have a large recording studio considering how much great music it produced. Plus, the country was ided at the height of Thatcherism. We wanted to bring some money from London to where we lived.”Over at Western Works, Cabaret Voltaire’s new neighbour was a bagpipe-playing Scotsman who was building and selling nuclear fallout shelters. “There was a rising sense of fear,” recalls Kirk of the time, one no doubt intensified for the people of South Yorkshire, given it was the location for the harrowing 1984 nuclear apocalypse TV drama Threads.Even as the socio-political climate grew gloomier, that original spark of autonomy and ambition remained alight, says Hawley. “Even with all the shit going on from those horrible fuckers, a lot of magical stuff happened. Beauty came out of some very difficult situations.” Ware links this mentality to the city’s history. “There is pride in craft in Sheffield that runs through everything – from cutlery to engineering. It’s in our blood.”Not all bands could contain their steam. “Artery had an intensity that was up there with Joy Division,” says Cocker. “But they didn’t have a Factory Records or a Tony Wilson. They got stuck in Sheffield, got frustrated, got off their heads, and lost it.” 2.3 had a single out on Fast Product before the Human League or Gang of Four, but collapsed. “We were like the Commitments but worse,” Bower says, likening the group to the dysfunctional Irish band from Roddy Doyle’s novel. “By 1979, it was like: ‘Screw it.’”But others did make it, of course. The days of Cocker and co dodging pint glasses have been replaced by city-wide adulation, an irony not lost on them. “One day, some people were chasing me and Jarv down the street to get our autographs,” Hawley says. “Jarvis turned to me and said: ‘It’s not that long ago since the same people were chasing us down the road trying to kill us.’”• Dreams to Fill the Vacuum: The Sound of Sheffield 1977-1988 is out on Cherry Red"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7679c932ee4d1c93b3633b4b97422fff893d117/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45cb25ef66ab724e8a25b203c1e1430f","title":"election 2019 john crace on the lowlights and the gaffes","story":"’s political sketch writer, John Crace, runs through the highs and the many, many lows of the 2019 general election campaign.

In the Scottish National party target seat of East Lothian, campaigners also said voting levels had been unusually high, suggesting people had been eager to cast their vote during daylight hours.Students also queued to vote at campus polling stations in the ultra-marginal constituency of Canterbury, where Labour is defending a lead of 187, in Exeter and in Lincoln, another Labour marginal.In Bermondsey, south-east London, a burst water main caused deep flooding, leading some voters to decide to leave and return later. Graham Kings said: “I could have gone home and put wellington boots on and waded across the flooded road to try to get in, but had to go to work and so will vote this evening.”Despite facing an energetic tactical voting campaign to oust him from his own constituency of Uxbridge, Boris Johnson was the first sitting prime minister in many years not to vote for himself, choosing instead to cast his vote close to Downing Street in the marginal constituency of Cities of London and Westminster.The Tories, who hold the seat, are facing a high-profile challenge from Chuka Umunna, who left the Labour party earlier this year and is contesting the seat for the Liberal Democrats.The former prime ministers Theresa May and David Cameron chose to vote in their home constituencies of Maidenhead and Witney in 2017 and 2015 respectively, while both Gordon Brown and Tony Blair would habitually start election day in their seats of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, and Sedgefield.Johnson, by contrast, arrived at a polling station in Methodist Central Hall around 8am accompanied by his dog, Dilyn, kissing the animal for waiting photographers as he left.The US Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lent her support to Labour with a call for the UK public to vote.Sharing an anti-Conservative video originally posted by Jeremy Corbyn, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: “This video is about the UK, but it might as well have been produced about the United States.“The hoarding of wealth by the few is coming at the cost of peoples’ lives. The only way we change is with a massive surge of *new* voters at the polls. UK, Vote!”Corbyn was greeted by supporters and a lone protester as he and his wife, Laura Alvarez, arrived to cast their votes in his constituency of Islington North in London. Footage appeared to show the female protester, who was dressed as Elmo from Sesame Street, remonstrating with security guards and police who tried to block her, before Corbyn intervened to ask: “Hello guys, can we stop the arguing please?”The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson cast her vote at a primary school in Bearsden in her constituency of East Dunbartonshire, while the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, posed for photographers at a ballot box in her home constituency of Glasgow East.In Northern Ireland, tactical voting campaigns and electoral pacts mean a number of seats will be watched closely for potential upsets.Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, wore a union jack scarf to cast her vote for a rival unionist in her home seat of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, after her party withdrew from the constituency in a bid to unseat Sinn Féin.In North Belfast, her colleague Nigel Dodds, the leader of the DUP in Westminster, faces a threat from Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, after the Social Democratic and Labour party withdrew to help his campaign.Speaking in Doncaster, the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, told reporters he was hoping for “very, very heavy rain” in the town on Thursday, in the hope it would depress the votes of the other parties.In Scotland, a 48-year-old man was arrested after explosives officers were called to investigate a suspicious device near a polling station in North Lanarkshire.Residents were evacuated as a controlled explosion was carried out on the package at the Glen Tower flats in Motherwell, with constituents registered to vote at Glen Tower redirected to a nearby polling station. Police Scotland later said the item had been found to be a “non-viable device”.With the prime minister vowing that a Conservative victory would lead to Britain exiting the EU within weeks, Labour promising a second referendum and the Liberal Democrats offering to overturn the 2016 vote entirely, the campaign was inevitably dominated by the issue of Brexit, with the Conservatives seeking to boil down their campaign message to a bald promise to “get Brexit done”.A cautious Tory campaign sought to limit access to Johnson, most notably in the prime minister’s refusal to take part in a keynote interview with the BBC’s Andrew Neil, unlike the other major party leaders.The party’s manifesto was light on concrete promises, while the party was accused of hiding many leading Conservatives – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg and other hardline European Research Group members – from the limelight for much of the campaign.Labour sought to keep the focus on the NHS, insisting the party would save the health service from Tory plans to privatise it. Its own manifesto made big-spending pledges to increase funds for the NHS, give free broadband to every home and compensate the so-called “Waspi” generation of women who lost out when pension rules were changed.But the party has also struggled to shake off the issue of antisemitism during the campaign, an issue which John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, acknowledged could influence the election result.Polling throughout has consistently shown the Conservatives comfortably ahead, though the party’s lead has shrunk throughout the campaign.The final poll, released on Thursday and conducted by Ipsos Mori for the London Evening Standard, gave the Conservatives an 11-point lead over Labour, but with one in four respondents saying they could change their minds, and pollsters having been proved wrong in 2015 and 2017, the result remains unpredictable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec52fffad4767aa66951bf28defa800852a315c6/0_245_4588_2753/master/4588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6bbaf7f3d80e211efd6ae647e506fab","title":"from a thumping tory win to a corbyn coalition four election scenarios","story":"How some of the more likely outcomes could take shape – and results to watch forAs Britain heads to the polls here are four possible scenarios for the outcome.Boris Johnson wins a landmark victory, taking 360 seats, winning over traditional Labour voters in small cities and big towns in Wales, the Midlands and the north of England, while holding steady in Scotland, London and the south of England generally.The governing party could be on track to gain even more, 50-plus seats, if it takes others talked about as being in play: Dennis Skinner’s seat of Bolsover (Lab maj 5,288), Alyn and Deeside in north Wales (Lab maj 5,235) and West Bromwich West (Lab maj 4,460).Labour would bear the brunt of losses, falling just short of 220 seats. That would be the worst election result for the party since 1983, making it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to hang on as leader – while Johnson would have a free rein to complete Brexit at the third time of asking by 31 January.This is roughly the closest to the prevailing polling, in line with YouGov’s Tuesday prediction of a majority of 28. The Conservatives would end up with 340 seats (up 23) and Labour on 237, slightly ahead of its disappointing 2015 result, but 25 seats down on last time.Signs this is happening would be if the Conservatives gain Lincoln (Lab maj 1,538), Derby North (Lab maj 2,015), Wakefield (Lab maj 2,176) Wrexham (Lab maj 1,832), but not the seats with larger majorities mentioned in the section above.The Conservatives could afford to lose two seats in Scotland to the SNP (Stirling and Gordon) and one in London (Chipping Barnet), but would still have a good enough result to allow Boris Johnson to look forward to five years in Downing Street.After a successful pre-election purge of rebel Conservative MPs, even a majority of 10 or more could easily be sufficient for governing, particularly in completing the first phase of the UK’s exit from the EU.This familiar scenario kicks in if the Conservatives miss the 326 overall majority figure by a few seats. Boris Johnson could try for a minority government if the Conservatives end up in the low 320s, but anything in the high 310s would leave him theoretically reliant on the DUP, already unhappy with the renegotiated Brexit deal.The prime minister would remain in post while he tried to form a government, while it would be for the combined opposition parties to come up with an alternative and, if necessary, defeat him in a motion of no confidence sometime before Christmas.On this scenario, the Conservatives end up even, probably meaning that gains made in the northern half of England and all of Wales, are offset by losses elsewhere. The Tories do take seats such as Barrow and Furness (Lab maj 209) and Peterborough (Lab maj 607 at the last general election), but not Ipswich (Lab maj 831) or Stockton South (Lab maj 888) on Teesside.Labour, meanwhile, makes more gains in the south-east, taking Southampton Itchen (Con maj 31) and Hastings and Rye (Con maj 346), only loses four seats in Scotland and hangs on in Canterbury (Lab maj 187) and Stroud (Lab maj 687). Overall the party is still down, at 253 seats, but remains competitive.To complete the picture SNP gains four from the Tories, the last of which is Ochil and South Perthshire (Con maj 3,359), and the Lib Dems pick up Richmond Park (Con maj 45) in London. In Northern Ireland, gains by the SDLP in Belfast South and Foyle and by the Alliance party in North Down help with the arithmetic.It depends a little on the wider results picture, but if the Conservatives fall below the low 310s Boris Johnson could not form a government just with the DUP. The prime minister might try to talk to the SNP and the Lib Dems but the initiative would move to the opposition to see if it could form a government led by Corbyn.It is possible for Labour to lead a coalition if the party ends up with the same number of seats it has now, on 262. The party wins Norwich North (Con maj 507), gains Northampton North (Con maj 807) and Milton Keynes South (Con maj 1,725), offsetting any seat losses elsewhere.Winning Putney (Con maj 1,554) and Watford (Con maj 2,092) would be particularly helpful, as would restricting any losses to the Conservatives to a couple of seats in the north of England.The SNP also gains Angus (Con maj 2,645), the Lib Dems St Albans (Con maj 6,109) and there is a surprise win for an independent in East Devon. Beyond that there is limited headroom for the SNP, but if the Lib Dems can really pull off wins in Winchester (Con maj 9,999), or even Esher and Walton (Con maj 23,298), then the Tories are in trouble, and Boris Johnson out of a job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39821d3bc89ca14e46d84012a6f5d172f2fb6441/0_0_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c58f6dd8fea78da1a49148e788f48666","title":"uk news push alerts negative labour positive tories","story":" analyses default push notifications for nine of biggest UK news appsA  analysis of push alerts for nine of the biggest UK news apps shows that, on balance, notifications about the Conservative party tend to be positive, while notifications about Labour are overwhelmingly negative.While most of the providers showed a tendency to view the Conservatives more positively, the outcome was skewed by the , which sent strongly pro-Tory and anti-Labour alerts.For the millions of British voters who have news apps installed on their smartphones, push notifications are an important source of information about politics. While some recipients will tap on the pings and buzzes to read full stories, the majority of push alerts are never acted upon. That means the one-line summaries of the day’s breaking news events are frequently all readers get, giving them an enormous amount of power to shape perceptions. downloaded every UK-specific news app in the top 40 on the iOS App Store, and enabled the default notifications for each, from 6 November until 11 December, the day before the election.Following a methodology applied by Loughborough University to analyse print news, the  tracked every push notification in that period, and evaluated whether they were positive or negative for each of the three largest parties.There were a net 18 positive push notifications for the Conservative party in the period since 6 November, and a net two negative for the Liberal Democrats. For the Labour party, however, there were a net 57 negative.But the distributions were not the same for every publication. BBC News largely avoided notifications with clear winners, sending a net of one negative story about Labour and an even breakdown of stories about the Conservatives. Similarly with the  (evens for Labour and net two negative for the Conservatives) and Sky News (net five negative for Labour and net three negative for the Conservatives).The Mirror expressed clear support for Labour through its choice of which stories to send notifications for, and how to phrase them: a net three positive for Labour and net three negative for the Conservatives, with neither party receiving a single story to counterweight the general impression. The Mail was roughly as skewed in the other direction, with four negative stories about Labour and a net of zero about the Conservatives, and the Express was stronger, with eight stories attacking Labour, and a net of four supporting the Conservatives.Skewing everything, however, is the . The paper sent out 40 push alerts that were negative for Labour, without a single positive story, and a net of 18 that were positive for the Conservatives. The paper’s practice of pushing most opinion columns contributed substantially to the skew, but even with those excluded, notifications such as “‘Reckless’ Labour to send public debt soaring with £600bn borrowing spree” and “Corbyn will betray Brexit, Johnson says as he takes election fight to Labour heartlands” left readers in no doubt as to who the publication supported.Even without the  included in the count, however, the Tories received a net zero positive pushes from all the other publications the  tracked, while Labour received -17.A few specific events stand out in the analysis. On 6 and 7 November there was a run of bad notifications for Labour, around Tom Watson’s resignation, Ian Austin’s intervention, and no less than five hits from the  in one 24-hour period. Conversely, the one-sided election pact announced a few days later by the Brexit party saw a run of positive notifications for the Conservative party, with the Express specifically noting that Corbyn was “facing wipeout”.One common concern about push notifications is the lack of any norms around mistakes. Both the Express and Daily Mail pushed out the claim that, in the Mail’s phrasing: “Labour activist ‘PUNCHES Matt Hancock’s adviser at Leeds hospital’”. In fact, no such punch was thrown, and video released less than an hour later showed the adviser walking into a protester’s arm. But neither publication sent a follow-up noting the error, and for any user who did not seek out extra news, the initial push may be the only claim they heard on the matter.Four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr is taken to his GP with suspected pneumonia.

A straight report of Labour’s broadband policy from the BBC (“Labour promises free broadband for all by part-nationalising BT and paid for by tech firm taxes, if it wins election”) was widely seen as a positive push from the news service that could help the party’s electoral chances.

He said: “Boris Johnson makes speeches about the cult of the strongman and wanting to stand up to human rights abusers in certain situations, but then in other situations pops up making contradictory signals to that.”Without naming him, he also delivered a scathing assessment of a recent foreign secretary’s ability to think strategically. Casson recounted: “I once got stuck in traffic in the back of a car with one of the most recent foreign secretaries and I said: ‘Given all of us in the Foreign Office spend our time trying to make sure you don’t do anything different from what we normally do, what is it the thing that you think you are trying to get us to do to leave behind as your legacy?’“This person thought about it for a bit and said: ‘Well, I really think we should be trying to save the African elephant and leading on the international wildlife trade, and it is really important that we bring girls into school worldwide and I suppose one of these conflicts in the world, we should be taking a lead on solving.” We then had a discussion about whether Palestine, Libya, Syria or Yemen was particularly ripe for British intervention.”Johnson repeatedly as foreign secretary highlighted the future of elephants, using one speech at Chatham House to admit he was “obsessed with the tragic fate of the African elephant”. He also said more girls in education was the key to unlocking some of the world’s greatest problems.Casson added: “I say this by way of saying there has been an absence of any depth of strategic thinking not just at political level but also confidence amongst officials not just in the Foreign Office but across Whitehall to think clearly about what is the nature of the power that we hold.“The bald fact for me is British foreign policy – as I was brought up to recognise it – came to an end in September 2013, when David Cameron made a conscious decision to stop being an activist prime minister on foreign policy after he lost the Syrian vote in the Commons. Since then it is very difficult to name an issue on which Britain has made the running in the international space.”He insisted this was not a lament for liberal interventionism, but instead a breakdown in a pro-active optimistic foreign policy drawing on Britain’s strengths.As a former foreign affairs private secretary to Cameron, he added a prime minister “needs to be on the telephone a lot and travel a lot and see a big part of their job as having relationships with foreign leaders for the sake of relationships with foreign leaders. Since Tony Blair, and perhaps Gordon Brown, we have not really had a prime minister that has had the capacity and the appetite to see as a fundamental slice of their job investing in those political relationships. It has cost us in terms of foreign policy outcomes.”He said from his own experience at No 10 that it is “a bloody battle” to get the prime minister to focus on foreign leaders since “the building is full of people who think it is a waste of time because it does not win you elections”.He attributed the decline in UK foreign policy influence to a range of factors including the absence of the US holding the ring for its allies, the distraction of Brexit, the shift to a multi-polar world, but also the absence of any confidence in the British political system about what the UK can offer to help the shape the world.The critical factor in shaping British future power would be Brexit, he said, saying the world would be watching and smelling for the signs of economic success or failure. “If the rest of the world think we are in a mess, the rest of our foreign policy will be very difficult to conduct.”He added that Britain had confused its international brand. “Are we an open country that aspires to set an example and stand up for certain type of norms and influence?” He said this showed in the country’s policies on visas, foreign investment and universities. “It is not just about foreign policy statements. We need to find our way back to a clearer narrative of what is our point of attraction.”He also urged Britain to be ruthless about aligning its future leverage after Brexit, saying it needed to think whether it wished to remain close to Europe, become the best friend of the newly emerging nations or instead maintain as long as possible the transatlantic umbrella. He said the few bureaucratic changes under way in Whitehall to prepare for Brexit did not match the scale of the challenge facing the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c634dcef354dbc023f3031d596ed57f63195d7/485_818_2148_1289/master/2148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d894c505da85a2d6758650eb58718309","title":"whats happening where you are on polling day","story":"Help us document what’s happening around Britain on polling day by sharing your stories, photos and videosAs you go out to vote today we want you to show us what’s happening on the ground.This is the place to share your stories from wherever you are on polling day in words, pictures or video.

It’s here.Here are some last-minute messages from the parties.From the Brexit partyGood evening. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Haroon. This blog will be running until about 9pm, at which point we will launch a fresh one.Here, fairly randomly, is some ‘how it’s going’ speculation from journalists.From the Times’ Steven Swinford.From the Daily Mail’s John StevensFrom the former Sun political journalist Steve HawkesJackson Carlaw, the interim Scottish Tory leader, has had a spat on Twitter with Nicola Sturgeon and her Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, after he tweeted that he had voted this morning in his East Renfrewshire constituency, 12 days after stating on Twitter he had sent in his postal vote.An eagle-eyed voter flagged the apparent discrepancy, to Sturgeon’s amusement.Russell, the Scottish government’s cabinet secretary for constitutional relations, was more pointed. He tweeted: “Eh? Surely not as voting twice would be a criminal offence. Whereas tweeting something that isn’t true for electoral effect is just crass and dishonest …”Carlaw, who holds the contiguous Scottish parliament seat of Eastwood, protested to both Sturgeon and Russell he had just made two proxy votes, both for Tory candidate Paul Masterton. East Renfrewshire is an SNP target seat, and is often a barometer of Scotland’s shifting political mood. The Tories took it from the SNP in 2017 with a 4,712 majority, while the SNP had taken it from Labour’s then Scottish leader Jim Murphy in 2015 in its remarkable landslide. The previous Westminster seat of Eastwood had long been Tory-held until Murphy won it first in 1997.Talking of Southampton Itchen, and its majority of just 31, here is a picture of a queue from a polling station there:And here’s a lovely, festive queue in Northamptonshire:It’s a similar story in Leeds:The election count in Orkney and Shetland, the UK’s most northerly and most dispersed constituency, relied on a eight-seater aircraft propeller-driven aircraft to bring ballot boxes to the count on Friday morning.The constituency, which has 34 inhabited islands including the isolated Foula and Fair Isle, is the only one that relies on aircraft to transport ballot papers to a count. A Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander operated by Loganair was due to take off from Sumburgh on the southern tip of mainland Shetland at 1am on Friday after all the archipelago’s ballot boxes arrive, for a 45-minute flight to Kirkwall, the capital town of Orkney 90 miles south.Onboard was Jan Riise, Shetland’s returning officer, who will keep guard over its 30 ballot boxes.Problems have also been reported at Southampton University where the students’ union says at least 76 people have been turned away from the polling station despite being registered to vote.A blogpost on the union’s website says:We’ve received reports of multiple students being prevented from voting their local polling station due to an administrative error, meaning they’re not on their polling station list despite being registered to vote.This morning, our VP education and democracy, Jo Lisney, experienced this first hand and was turned away from her polling station in Southampton Test. Jo says: “It was a shock this morning when I went to vote and was told I couldn’t. I had my polling card come through so I knew I could, but the people at the station showed me the list and it said ‘details deleted’. After this I called the Electoral Commission and they confirmed I can vote and told me to go back with my polling card but if it doesn’t work, call them again.”Since then we’ve received at least 75 further reports of students experiencing the same issue.One of the seats in the city – Southampton Itchen – was decided by just 31 votes in 2017, the Tories’ Royston Smith holding on to the seat by the skin of his teeth. Despite these issues, we are thrilled to hear so many students are voting in the general election today.In Liverpool, 48 voters were given ballot papers for the wrong constituency, the Liverpool Echo reports. They were given papers for Wavertree, rather than Riverside, at a polling station that serves both constituencies. Tony Reeves, Liverpool city council’s returning officer, told the Echo: Due to a medical issue overnight, a key member of staff was unable to be present when it opened at 7am. The remaining staff took a decision to oversee both constituencies until a replacement arrived, to make sure voters were not turned away.A short time later it was identified that 48 electors had accidentally been given a ballot paper for Wavertree, rather than Riverside and had voted in the wrong constituency.He added that the votes wrongly cast would be declared null and void and that they were attempting to contact the voters in question to allow them to recast their vote. They say never say never in politics, but Nigel Dodds says the DUP will never, ever support Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. The party’s deputy leader slammed the door on any conceivable deal, tacit or otherwise, to put Labour’s leader into Downing Street.“Jeremy Corbyn is someone whom we could never support as prime minister,” Dodds told the .Lest there be any doubt about conceivably backing a Corbyn-led coalition, Dodds used the word “never” four times. For most unionists Jeremy Corbyn is a complete no no. We will never support Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. Jeremy Corbyn will not get our support.Dodds cited the Labour leader’s positions on antisemitism, IRA terrorism, and a Scottish referendum.Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister brings a lot of other things to the table which we could never accept … all those things would be anathema to the DUP and the people that we represent.Dodds was speaking outside a polling station in Belfast North, where he faces a stiff challenge from Sinn Féin’s John Finucane.By drawing a line down the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal betrays the DUP and arguably advances Sinn Féin’s goal of Irish unity, but Dodds still prefers Johnson to Corbyn.He said the DUP could retain influence in Westminster and push for a new deal – as long as Johnson obtained just a slender majority. It’s getting tighter and tighter and tighter. In 1992, John Major had a majority of 21 and he ended up depending on the unionist MPs in parliament. I think the DUP will be significant players in the next parliament.More pictures of queues are emerging as people make their way home from work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e28721fe3e809c2440fc0152cc697c345c2b77/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6fe6f808c2273703e148ac8c5fd4958","title":"election opinion polls uk 2019 latest poll tracker tories labour","story":"Find out who’s ahead in the polls on the campaign’s final day.

With a genre dating back hundreds of years, the choices are overwhelming. So where do you start? With the benefits, that’s where.“Music brings people together and helps kids – and parents – listen better,” says composer John Webb, who has worked with everyone from five-year-old songwriters to traditional Indian musicians and a virtual symphony orchestra to introduce new audiences to classical music. Classical tracks are also scientifically proven to relieve stress, boost brainpower and even help us be more open emotionally – all good news for happy families. So, here’s how to get involved ...Toddlers and preschoolers“Young kids are innately musical,” says Webb, mimicking the singsong speech and extended vowel sounds we instinctively use with small people – “Ooh what a bee-yoo-tiful baby”. Children have an unrepressed desire to dance, too. “Kids move in different ways to different music, tiptoeing, stamping and twirling,” explains Webb.So how can you bring out the best in your mini maestro? Composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty topped the iTunes Classical Charts, says: “Try listening to Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Saëns, which describes lots of wild animals through music.”From age five to eightDid you know that this is the prime age for children to write music? “Kids naturally make up their own songs as they play,” says Webb, who generously describes those improvised 10-second tunes as, “mashups”. To enhance that natural ability, he advises using a story as a hook. “Kids love stories, and quickly understand that different notes and speeds of music create a sense of character. Classical music is easily simplified and it can be creative and powerful for children.”Want to get involved? Try something like the BBC Singers Family Concert (9 February 2020, Milton Court Concert Hall, Barbican, London prices from £5), which promises to be very interactive and is aimed at kids aged five and over. Alternatively, join the BBC Concert Orchestra at Musical Roots (22 February 2020, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, London prices from £5) for a magical adventure the whole family can enjoy, exploring exciting and unusual connections between composers, their music and their families.From age nine to 12You may know that playing an instrument can improve a child’s memory and coordination, and teach them perseverance. You definitely know that persuading your pre-teen to practise playing an instrument is like lighting a stick of dynamite, so explosive are the arguments.The solution, suggests Davis, could be as simple as inspiring your child by letting them see someone older play their instrument expertly. The BBC is laying on two upcoming events that will transport young people into a different world and get them excited about playing.Try Family Total Immersion: Lift Off! (1 December, Barbican Hall, London prices from £5) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, which celebrates 50 years since the moon landing with live music, interactive workshops and film to take you on a musical adventure through space. Best of all, there are more than two hours of drop-in foyer activities, including the chance for kids to try a variety of instruments before the show.David Walliams is also doing a special performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (2 May 2020, Barbican, London prices from £5), which is virtually guaranteed to hook kids into playing classical music. Walliams will read from his bestselling children’s books, including Bad Dad and The World’s Worst Children, alongside musical treats from a full orchestra.The teenage yearsCan parents introduce anything to their sceptical teen? “The kiss of death is for a parent to show keenness,” warns Webb. “Osmosis is your best bet, so play the pieces you like at home. Go for tracks with a pounding rhythm and bleakness, like Shostakovich Symphony No 5, as the raw energy and emotion may get your teen’s attention.”Film can also be a good entry point for teenagers. “I would always point towards innovative composers and performers who are very current,” says Davis. “So maybe don’t start with Mozart. Instead, go for composers like Max Richter, who scored Mary Queen of Scots, or Joby Talbot, who scored The League of Gentlemen. Both Richter and Talbot are also serious concert hall composers in their own right.” Talbot’s Everest will be performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra next year (20 June 2020, Barbican Hall, London prices from £10).If all else fails …Stealth is a weapon at your disposal. “There are so many great concerts out there, but the mistake is dragging a reluctant child to a classical concert and expecting them to walk out enlightened and interested,” warns Davis. “So find an appropriate concert of music your child might grow to like and research the music that’s going to be performed. Play sections of it in the car and at home ahead of the concert. Otherwise it’s a huge amount to take in. As the composer Philip Glass once said: ‘People don’t know what they love, they love what they know.’”Learn more about getting the whole family into classical music with advice and events from the BBC’s Get Involved initiative"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ee784fcdd4027a5ef4fd8c71226c1032b8aeb04/0_52_1634_980/master/1634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=956a0dfa172a1c09e7f770c69bb77bda","title":"mindful music how listening to classical can help you be more present","story":"Classical music is known for its calming properties, but it’s more than pleasant background music. Jonathan Lennie chooses seven tracks that promote a feeling of mindfulness in the present momentLife can be chaotic – between work, family and social commitments many of us have difficulty switching off. And the thought of spending quality time on yourself is often forgotten. This is what mindfulness seeks to address. Non-judgmental moment-to-moment awareness is a form of meditation in which we engage with our thoughts and the world around us in the present moment. And being a spiritual art form of fixed duration, classical music is an ideal medium with which to practise it. Here are seven pieces of classical music that can transport us into a world of relaxation and wellbeing.Edward Elgar – Variations on an Original Theme, Op 36 (Enigma): 9 NimrodNimrod is one of a suite of short pieces from Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations. In popular culture it has become a British anthem, though it was actually a cryptic tribute to his friend Augustus Jaeger. The enigmatic element of the work is useful in mindful listening, in that the overarching musical theme is intended as a mystery that need not be solved – like the mystery of life, to be dipped into as it occurs. Concentrate on what is actually happening in the music as you breathe along with the work’s gentle pulse, rather than zoning out as you anticipate the orchestral climax. The conception of the work is an instance of mindfulness itself. The composer was noodling at the piano when his wife pointed out that he had written a marvellous melody. He had allowed it to emerge, he later said, “from nothing”.You can listen to this piece live at the BBC Concert Orchestra’s Orchestra Unwrapped concert on 26 September.Pauline Oliveros – Deep Listening“Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears,” said American experimental composer Pauline Oliveros. She became obsessed with mindfulness through “deep listening”, a term she coined in 1988 after descending four metres into a disused water tank to make a recording of the same name. The underground room had an acoustic resonance lasting 45 seconds, allowing the musicians to create a smooth overlapping texture by listening carefully to each other. The album Deep Listening presents four pieces conceived as an aid to mindful focus. Choose one of them, concentrate on the constant drone of the didgeridoo, then become aware of the slowly evolving sounds of accordion and voice as they expand and contract around it. Purge your mind of clutter as you focus on this swirling soundscape, allowing the melodic trombone line to order your thinking.Gustav Mahler – Symphony No 2 (Resurrection), UrlichtGustav Mahler declared that: “A symphony must be like the world. It must contain everything.” To experience his immense symphonies is, therefore, to musically engage with the vastness of the human experience, and his second is a case in point. It starts with a funeral march and questions the randomness of life, before concluding that it is wondrous and meaningful. This positivity begins in the fourth movement, Urlicht (Primal Light), a slow, simple song arranged for solo singer and sparse orchestra. When the choir, with full orchestra, enters for the final Resurrection movement and sings: “Die shall I in order to live rise again, yes rise again”, feel the energy flow through your body, swelling and expansive like the music.Johannes Ockeghem – Alma Redemptoris MaterIf ever there was a form of music designed for mindful reflection, it is Renaissance polyphony, which shows the beauty and complexity that can be achieved by voices alone. Alma Redemptoris Mater by Johannes Ockeghem is such an example. Written during the 15th century, this sacred motet is presented by just four voices. Close your eyes, breathe and follow the inidual vocal lines as they flow together and apart, weaving a rich harmonic tapestry of sound. Focus on the beauty of the words: “Loving mother of the redeemer, who opens the gate to heaven, and star of the sea … You who gave birth, in the wonderment of nature, to your own creator ...” After its five minutes duration, you should feel both calm and focused.You can listen to this piece performed live by the BBC Singers on 7 December.Ralph Vaughan Williams – The Lark AscendingThis exquisite musical depiction of a singing lark taking to the air has been described by British violinist Tasmin Little as “floating above a cushion of sound”. Its composer, Ralph Vaughan Williams was inspired by George Meredith’s poem The Lark Ascending. Read the poem, then listen to the music, focusing on the violin depicting the bird as “He rises and begins to round”. Observe the lark’s efforts to take flight: “As up he wings the spiral stair”, swooping as it trills “A song of light”. Follow its ascent, until at last the full orchestra glides with the creature, saluting its “Serenity in ravishment”. Finally, become the lark, letting your spirit fly free – and, in your mind’s eye, look down upon the rural landscape rolling beneath you.You can listen to this piece live at the BBC Symphony Orchestra concert on 1 November.Olivier Messiaen – Quartet for the End of TimeFrench composer Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time is an exceptional example of mindfulness. Incarcerated in a freezing prisoner of war camp, he created a piece about the end of time itself, when all earthly concerns will be swept away as foretold in the Revelation of St John. This extraordinary piece was premiered at the camp on old battered instruments in January 1941. By writing for the only instruments available (violin, cello, clarinet and piano), Messiaen was adapting to the moment, yet was focused on eternity. The mindful theme is also present in the musical structure itself, which is based on an unravelling mathematical sequence that, if played out, would be infinite.John Cage – 4’33’’Mindfulness is about time, specifically now. Consequently, the ultimate work of mindfulness might be John Cage’s 4’33’’. More of an experimental concept than piece of music, Cage’s 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence presents a set time framework in which a pianist (or any sologroup of musicians) sits at the piano and turns the pages of the empty score in silence. Meanwhile, the audience is invited to listen to the ambient sounds in the auditorium – breathing, air conditioning, the rumble of cars outside ... essentially, listening to the world around them as a unique aural event and appreciating its variety, rather than ignoring it as irrelevant noise. Of course, you don’t have to attend a concert to experience this – just set your timer, close your eyes and listen.Choose your own mindful listening from the BBC’s upcoming series of classical concerts from the BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra and BBC Singers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae4395199abd2e5f588a39804555ebd7eb6327a8/98_100_888_533/master/888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfaa36247509e8f671eebeb4ef6deddc","title":"i just wanted to sing elizabeth llewellyns unorthodox journey to becoming a soprano","story":"Despite an illness forcing a decade-long hiatus, the singer’s career has moved from strength to strength. She tells  Tshepo Mokoena about her path into operaSome of us are destined to end up on a particular path, no matter what obstacles life may hurl in the way. Opera singer Elizabeth Llewellyn is one of those people. The 46-year-old’s unorthodox journey from her childhood in south London to breathtaking stage and concert performances around the world is testament to how there’s no singular route into classical music.At first glance, her story starts in a way you might expect, with a piqued childhood interest. Aged 10, Llewellyn began the piano lessons that would form the bedrock of her musical education. “I remember my piano teacher gave me a cassette of violinist Nigel Kennedy, playing a version of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons,” she says, speaking on a busy day in New York between rehearsals for an upcoming lead role in Porgy and Bess.As a child born to Jamaican parents and growing up in the 1980s, a career in opera may not have been an obvious choice. But Llewellyn has never been the type to follow the crowd.She quickly became hooked on classical music. “When you’re a child, you tend to get involved in whatever’s around you. So when you’re learning an instrument, you absorb what your teacher feeds you.” In her case, that entailed taking in classical music of all sorts, during lessons that stretched for hours at a time on Saturday afternoons. But that seemingly ordinary foray into music would start to ert for Llewellyn.Unlike many of her professional opera peers, she took a 10-year detour at the start of her 20s, when an inexplicable illness – akin to a series of incessant, persistent colds – forced her to leave Manchester’s prestigious Royal Northern College of Music and stop singing altogether. After working in everything from IT and telecoms to the travel industry, Llewellyn wound up back where she belonged: singing, for rapturous audiences. She debuted professionally as Mimì in La Bohème with the English National Opera in 2010, and will sing as part of a BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus performance in March 2020.Looking back, Llewellyn can trace her love for music from piano to an interest buoyed by “choirs, then learning the violin when I was about 13. I was involved in orchestra, and string orchestra, the string quartet …” and as her voice trails off you wonder how she managed to fit it all in around school itself. After being accepted to the Royal Northern College of Music, however, her entire perspective changed. “I was used to playing piano concertos with the school orchestra, singing solos in concerts,” she remembers fondly. “And then … you get to music college. And you realise you haven’t got any technique you’re not actually very good compared to everyone else around you” – and now she chuckles at the memory. “That first year, for me, was a bit of a horror,” a moment when she stopped and thought: “Oh my goodness, I’m really not that good am I?”Although she felt she had much to learn, Llewellyn’s always deployed an emotional heft in her singing. It’s part of the reason why, after several years away from music, a director of a local, amateur operatic music group noticed her talent and suggested she pursue opera with more commitment. After all, as she recalls: “Even when I applied for music college, I don’t think I wanted to be ‘an opera singer’. I just wanted to sing.”Though she’d not been immersed in opera from infancy – as is a more common background – she felt an undeniable compulsion to sing. And her time away from music proved pivotal to enriching her vocal delivery. She gained the life experience to pour into her work that she would otherwise have lacked, she thinks, had she leapt into the professional world as a teen.“Although I wouldn’t have chosen for things to have worked out that way,” she says, referencing the mysterious illness that derailed her, “I think I benefited from having that time away from the classical music scene. For singers, I think it’s really important to grow up emotionally and take time to absorb the world around you, and what it means to be human.” Though she half-jokes that “some of the plots of operas are fairly ridiculous”, she notes that “they are all rooted in real stories”.And so she’s looking forward to digging into some of that emotive and narrative flair as one of four soloists when Richard Farnes conducts Beethoven’s Missa solemnis, in March next year. “Vocally, it’s a really interesting piece to prepare for.” She considers it “a bit more ‘full-fat’ than, say, Mozart in terms of vocal approach”. Even listening to her describe the piece’s “muscularity” it’s clear that a passion like hers has the capacity to turn someone who normally avoids classical music into one willing to experience some, live.Llewellyn knows people may critique her, or look to knock her unusual route to success. But she’s adamant about the power of self-belief – after all, it got her this far. “You’ve got to know that your voice and your way of looking at the world, and your approach, is just as valid as the next person’s,” she says. “Your uniqueness and the thing that makes you you is really interesting. You can get pulled in lots of directions otherwise, and have no voice – and that’s death for an artist.” Chances are, even if others tried to pull her to and fro, Llewellyn would land on her feet. The stage is her home.Listen to Elizabeth Llewellyn live as she joins three other stunning soloists and conductor Richard Farnes for Beethoven’s Missa solemnis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe915ca54e7af0c84420f550b290b3d7bf216b2e/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a482d2bd2b0b2de9db43d8d43be8f8cd","title":"leave the tuxedo at home classical music myths explored","story":"Don’t get caught up in outdated beliefs – classical music offers something for everyone, says Jonathan Lennie Despite the best efforts of orchestras and opera companies to attract a new and younger audience, some classical music myths still abound. Somehow, there persists an idea that classical concerts are very formal events in which people in tuxedos and ballgowns buy very expensive tickets to hear ancient, irrelevant music, performed by ageing men dressed like they are from the 19th century. And, even if you did manage to pass the classical music quiz to get in, they would soon spot your inappropriate behaviour and, not being an expert, you would have no idea what is going on, right? Wrong. None of that is true, of course.Trainers allowedModern audiences come in all shapes and sizes, and are as likely to be dressed in a T-shirt and jeans as in a suit and tie. What’s more, compared with other forms of entertainment, prices are very reasonable. Tickets for the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican in London, for instance, start at £12, or less if you take advantage of a young person’s scheme – certainly cheaper than a football match or the cinema in London, and not much to witness 90 professional musicians playing some of the world’s greatest music.Enjoy in unexpected placesMost performances take place in concert halls, but classical music is very erse – some concerts will feature a full symphony orchestra, others just a choir, a string quartet or even a solo pianist. Pieces for these smaller ensembles are called chamber music and are often presented in more intimate spaces, but over the past 10 years or so there has been a movement to present classical music outside of traditional venues altogether. The Multi-Story Orchestra, for instance, consists of young professional musicians playing a classical summer series at a multi-storey car park in London’s Peckham. Then there is Nonclassical, founded by classical composer and dance, grime, electro and hip-hop producer Gabriel Prokofiev, which puts on regular classical music gigs in pubs.Silence is not always goldenWhen it comes to concert etiquette, most concert halls – like most theatres – expect a degree of quiet attention from the audience. However, some organisations, such as BBC National Orchestra of Wales offer no-rules concerts. In its Classical Playlist: Live, audience members are encouraged to walk around, have a drink, keep their phones on and even take photos (Brangwyn Hall, Swansea, 5 October 2019). English National Opera (the London-based company that performs all its repertoire in English) is offering a relaxed performance of Gilbert and Sullivan’s comedy The Mikado, to encourage autistic adults and children to attend, inviting them to make noise if they like, while dimming the lights and removing any loud noises (23 November 2019).Beginners welcomeAs for not knowing what’s going on, all concerts provide a programme to read, explaining the background to the music you are hearing, and these are often free. The BBC even has a Discover New Music series, which includes its day-long Total Immersion events. (On 7 December 2019 at the Barbican, London, German composer Detlev Glanert’s work will be explored through film, interview and concerts with the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.) Meanwhile, there’s also a series entitled Classical for Starters – the BBC Concert Orchestra’s recent Orchestra Unwrapped saw Alice Farnham conducting pieces by Mozart and Stravinsky, alongside well-known film music by John Williams. A month later, Dalia Stasevska conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Rachmaninov’s sprightly Symphonic Dances (26 October 2019, Barbican, London). You may have noted that the conductors just mentioned are both women – the days of exclusively male orchestras conducted by old men are long gone. Indeed, BBC Symphony Orchestra has just appointed young British conductor Jules Buckley as its new creative artist in association. Buckley says he is eager “to innovate and challenge the stereotypes of what orchestral music should be”. His first concert with the orchestra will be at the Barbican, London, on Friday 28 February 2020 and features soul singer Lianne La Havas. Previously, Buckley has joined in the BBC Proms concerts at the Royal Albert Hall with erse programmes such as this year’s The Breaks, exploring the world of scratch DJs, hip-hop and breakdancing (6 September 2019).A millennium of varietyFinally, the assumption that classical music all sounds the same is clearly erroneous, given that it stretches back nearly a thousand years. From choirs singing mediaeval vocal polyphony, Tudor viol consorts, to songs for piano and voice, and vast modern-day orchestras, the scale and variety of music is incomparable. So while the incredible works of Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms will always have a place on the concert platform, there are plenty of pieces by modern, living composers too. Anna Meredith’s music, for example, embraces both electronica and traditional instruments – she has even written a Concerto for Orchestra and Beatboxer. Then there’s David Lang, whose fresh take on Beethoven’s Fidelio, Prisoner of the State, is a stripped-down opera with the orchestra on stage (11 January, Barbican). Spanning everything from medieval polyphony to beatboxing, there is no one single thing that is classical music – and the same is true for its audiences. All you have to do is turn up, buy a ticket and enjoy.Start your classical music journey with concerts from the BBC’s Classical for Starters series"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/619d728b1d701a74b3d7b4110cf2a1c12d4d68ab/0_345_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d2c327d99ee9da65e730fbb451166c4","title":"jack leach my one not out was a special thing","story":"Jack Leach has learned to take nothing for granted. He is England’s senior spinner while Moeen Ali takes an open-ended sabbatical. Yet even this status is not entirely reassuring.In Hamilton this month he was omitted from the Test team when England opted for an all‑pace attack, augmented by two part-time spinners, against New Zealand then he was laid low with a serious bout of gastroenteritis that led to him spending two nights in hospital. He is just about back to full strength as he sets off for South Africa on Friday.Obstacles keep appearing in front of Leach, often without warning. Yet he has managed to view them all as challenges, providing opportunities for self-improvement. Just as he was beginning to break through as a first‑team cricketer for Somerset in 2014 he fell in his bathroom and had concussion for two months.By 2017 and on the verge of England selection there were suddenly queries about the validity of his action, which came as a surprise to just about everyone – including himself. In 2018 he broke his thumb in the nets the day before he would have been selected for his first home Test then there was another bout of concussion having been hit on the head by a Morne Morkel delivery. A lesser man might have been discouraged by now.Yet despite all these trials Leach became a cult hero last summer after compiling arguably the greatest one not out in the history of the game at Headingley while Ben Stokes was running amok at the other end. His glasses acquired a fame unrivalled since the heyday of Eric Morecambe and David Steele. The nation’s club cricketers immediately felt an affinity with Leach.Whatever happens next he will always have that surreal Headingley afternoon. “I loved being part of that series,” he says. “I learned an awful lot in county cricket about the game. At international level you learn about your own game and yourself. It tests your character more than anything and that’s where I feel I’ve made big strides in the last 12 months.”What about being a cult hero? “I was aware of all that stuff and it was really nice to experience but at the same time it was not a fair reflection of where I was with my cricket. I’m there to bowl and I only got one not out but just to be part of that day and to see how it affected so many was a special thing. People kept telling me where they were when it all happened. They didn’t even like cricket but they were following it.”It is bizarre that Leach’s batting should be the most memorable element of his summer, though there were also 12 cheap Test wickets in that Ashes series. It was also a surprise as he acknowledges: “I had lost it with the bat but somehow I refound it under the highest pressure.”The rehabilitation began when he made a career-best 92 as nightwatchman against Ireland. “I batted a lot of balls and was reminded of what I used to do. That innings made me feel like I belonged at Lord’s, that I deserved to be there. I remembered how to watch the ball and react rather than premeditate and get into some horrible positions.“But could I do it against Australia when the bowlers were 10mph faster? I came to realise that if I trusted myself my system would work. Stand still, wait for the ball to be released and you will react if it’s coming at your head. You’ll get out of the way really quickly. Once you realise that, it’s a big hurdle out of the way.“I’ve never been so focused as at Headingley. I never looked any further than the ball I was facing. Of course Stokes’s innings was incredible. Initially he said: ‘Watch hard and try to get to the end of the over.’ After that he told me how I was going to face one or two balls an over and to back up, to look for two.”Alongside the graft he has used his cricketing brain to progress. “I realised I needed to strengthen my action, so one winter I concentrated on getting more spin on the ball, the next on being able to bowl a little quicker. Maybe coping with doubts about my action was the hardest. I felt it was seen as cheating and I wasn’t trying to do that. But as a consequence I learnt so much about my action.”It will not be easy for Leach in South Africa, either. The pitches rarely turn and the ball flies further through the thin air. But after 10 Tests and a highly respectable record Leach is now comfortable in an England shirt. He feels he belongs now and has the confidence of his teammates, which is half the battle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443b9484de2a6951f33e591e60fa27b9bbdf5804/109_8_893_536/master/893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f45194ead92dc3aa93a42c86db94a533","title":"victoria aggar wada resigns russia ban athletes silencing","story":"The World Anti-Doping Agency has been rocked by the resignation of Victoria Aggar, a highly respected member of its own Athlete Committee, who said she quit after Wada broke its promises and failed to protect clean athletes. revealed on Tuesday that Aggar, a retired British Paralympian who has served six years on the committee, was on the brink of going because of Wada’s “spineless and appalling” decision not to issue a blanket ban on Russia.Echoing the views of many athletes, she also argued that allowing Russians to compete at Euro 2020 – and under a neutral flag at the 2020 Olympics and 2022 World Cup despite a four-year ban imposed on Monday – made a mockery of the system.But in her written resignation letter Aggar went further still – revealing that Wada had suppressed the voices of its Athlete Committee, which is supposed to reflect the views of thousands of sportsmen and women on anti-doping matters.“I do not feel that Wada exists any more,” said Aggar. “Too many political games (or machinations), too many conflicts and too much self-interest has led to too many bad decisions, compromises and broken promises.“Most recently the biggest blow to athletes is the decision by Wada to ignore calls from its very own Athlete Committee for Russia to be banned from competing at the next Olympic and Paralympic Games, despite promising earlier this year to enforce the toughest sanctions available if the retrieved data from Moscow was found to be manipulated,” she added.Aggar also revealed that Wada had refused to publish recent Athlete Committee’s statements on its website.“I am a firm believer that all athletes have the right to an unfiltered voice,” she added. “The concept of silencing athletes is one of the reasons why we are seeing so much abuse in sport and it only serves to reinforce the imbalance of power.“Events over the past two years have fundamentally shaken my belief in an organisation that I felt initially served a great purpose in protecting the integrity of sport – protecting clean athletes on their journey of pursuing their dreams.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c4cb1a642436b68778653844a55dae8db5a3b9/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f91109ae65c61f17e2a53318efb6d286","title":"peter pan review storyhouse chester","story":"Storyhouse, ChesterSet against the never-never-land of present-day austerity, Gary Owen’s production broadens the play’s appealJM Barrie’s 1904 play about a boy who never ages gets older by more than a century in this adaptation by dramatist Gary Owen. It’s set in present-day south Wales, making the focus as much Barry as Barrie.Owen wrote powerfully about family dysfunction in his 2015 Royal Court success Violence and Son, and, though his Peter Pan is pitched for families, he hasn’t abandoned domestic sociology. The Darling children can fly off with Peter and Tinker Bell because their parents are exhaustedly neglectful, earning money in the never-never-land of the austerity economy.As Owen’s Killology (2017) explored the escapist landscape of video games, it’s a surprise that Peter’s fantastic alternative world involves no digital interaction. This Neverland is a children’s playground, a possibly queasy choice as Pan fanatic Michael Jackson set up a dubious juvenile wonderland in honour of Barrie, whose own fascination with children has raised suspicion. Due to his broad target audience, Owen can’t explore those ideas, but focuses instead, as much current culture does, on the impulse to tell stories.As visualised by director Martin Constantine and designer April Dalton, the show is an awfully high adventure. The cast deserve a frequent flyer card as they reach for the lights, expertly counterweighted by shadowing technicians moving in unison. With characters also frequently descending through the floor, there is an unusually strong sense of the stage as a vertical space.Commendably avoiding the insipidity that can afflict Peter and Tinker Bell, James Phoon and Carlie Enoch are sometimes perhaps a little too sipid, exuding comic cockiness and controlling know-all-ness respectively. Making her professional debut, Georgia Jackson impressively brings intelligence and adolescent volatility to Wendy. Imogen Slaughter enjoyably doubles as Captain Hook and Mrs Darling, an intriguing psychological variation on the common pairing of the patriarch and the pirate.Though the need for broad appeal makes Owen’s writing less vivid than in his adult plays, this is a verbally and visually smart cover version of a seasonal standby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/772307ecb4d794c0560d6fbd64ac000a86a9bb88/264_268_4072_2444/master/4072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4d4b24b5fb412b6714c5170055acca","title":"ring alarm review amazon diy wireless home security system","story":"DIY wireless home security system is a great alarm that’s smart enough without trying to do too muchAmazon’s new Ring Alarm smartens up the traditional home security system without radically changing how it works, combining the best of both worlds into a DIY-friendly wireless alarm arrangement that just works.It’s been a 16-month wait in the UK since the Ring Alarm line of products launched in the US in July 2018, but it has been worth it.The Ring Alarm takes the “if it ain’t broke” approach to a smart alarm system. Take a traditional alarm system, make it wireless and inject a bit of smart into it without trying to do too much and making it over-complicated.The system comes in a kit with one contact sensor, one motion detector, a keypad, a range extender and the base station, which connects to your home wifi and contains a very loud siren. It’s enough to get you started, but if you have more than one entry door or ground-floor windows, you will probably need at least one more contact sensor or motion detector.The Ring Alarm is a DIY, wireless solution, which makes it rental-friendly. You can screw everything in place if you want or, as I did, simply stick the various bits in place with foam fixers.Installation was surprisingly straightforward and easy. You’ll need a Ring account, and its app on your smartphone, which guides you through the whole process. Plug the base station into power and hook it up to your home network via ethernet or wifi.Then it’s simply a process of pulling the battery tabs out of the various bits one by one and choosing where to put them. The whole lot can be done in about 15 minutes if you know where you want everything to go.The system uses the Z-Wave wireless protocol, not wifi, to connect to the various different components, reaching up to 76 metres from the base station. A range extender is included in the kit, but each device works as its own range extender, so unless you live in a really big house or have thick walls and obstructions, you probably won’t need it.The user-replaceable 3V lithium batteries in the contact and motion sensors should last about three years, while the rechargeable battery in the keypad lasts between six and nine months. It can also be left plugged into the microUSB power adapter if you have a plug socket where you want it mounted.The keypad arms and disarms the system like any traditional alarm. Type in your four-digit pin and press the “Away” button, which triggers a 60-second timer accompanied by a red light and what sounds like a game-show countdown tone for you to get out the door. Both the keypad and the base station make a noise and flash to let you know what’s going on during arming or disarming.When you come home, simply punch in your pin and hit the “Disarm” button before the entry delay timer runs out. There’s also a “Home” mode for when you’re staying in, which arms only the contact sensors by default. The LED ring on the base station shines red when the alarm is set or blue when it’s off.The keypad charges via microUSB and can be mounted practically anywhere. I stuck it to the wall behind the front door for convenience.The alarm worked faultlessly in my two-month test, going off when it should and not when it shouldn’t. The motion sensors weren’t errantly triggered by flashes of light, as some can be. You can also tailor the motion sensor sensitivity to stop it being activated by pets – though as my home is pet-free, I couldn’t test how well this works with cats or dogs.As a basic, easy-to-install wireless alarm, the system excels, but it’s also a little bit smarter than most.You can control the whole thing from the Ring app, which means you can arm and disarm it remotely. You can get notifications when things happen, see the states of various sensors such as when a door was opened or closed, see battery levels of the various bits, and change settings such as brightness of LEDs or volume level of alerts.One of the best features is the ability to give everyone their own pin, which means you can see who armed or disarmed the alarm and when. That includes guest codes, handy for neighbours or tradespeople, which can be set to operate on a schedule for extra security.The alarm system can also integrate with any other Ring products you might have. You can set cameras to record, floodlights to fire up and other bits when the delay entry or alarm is triggered.The Ring Alarm works just fine without a monthly subscription, but a Ring Protect Plus subscription of £8 a month or £80 a year adds two extras. The first is a 3G backup connection that activates when your internet goes down, meaning the alarm still works when there’s a power cut.The second is optional assisted monitoring. When the alarm goes off, Ring’s automated system phones through a list of people until it gets an answer.One Ring Protect Plus subscription works with all Ring devices in your house, so if you have cameras, you get 30 days of video events and snapshots as well as a few other things.It’s worth noting that Ring is under scrutiny for the way it links with police in the US, and the use of its Neighbors app, and the use by users of footage captured by its cameras. As with any smart device, whether or not you should use it comes down to whether you trust the manufacturer – in this case Amazon. The alarm system potentially raises fewer privacy concerns, however, as it doesn’t need cameras to operate.The Ring Alarm starter kit costs £249 in the UK or $199 in the US. Additional contact sensors cost £29$20, motion sensors cost £39$30 and keypads cost £59$50.For comparison, smart alarm systems from traditional manufacturers such as Yale start at £150 for the most basic kits and scale quickly with the number of sensors, sirens and keypads required.The Ring Alarm manages something that few smart home devices do: it’s a simple, effective product that isn’t worse just because it’s smart.Day to day, you can just use the simple, quality-looking keypad and go about your day. It’s easy to install, rental-friendly, straightforward to use and adaptable to various needs. It doesn’t try to do too much, it’s just a good alarm in and of itself, and doesn’t need a single other Ring product to work well.The Ring app is also well-designed, responsive and works reliably - something that can’t be said of some more established competitors. The smart bits, such as being able to get alerts when things happen, remotely control the alarm and review events from inidual sensors, are good too, as is the ability to generate unique pins for guests or tradespeople.Having a backup battery in everything, plus the option of backup 3G, also means the alarm is dependable, even if the power goes out. I felt an extra-level of reassurance having the Ring Alarm system installed and armed compared to just having smart cameras set up while on a recent holiday.Start integrating other smart devices you have in your home and you can build some really sophisticated security systems.One thing the Ring Alarm kit and components are not is cheap - at least in the UK, where it is significantly more expensive than in the US. Competitors from traditional security firms start cheaper, but scale in a similar way with inidual sensors.If you want a simple DIY wireless alarm that’s easy to install and use, but you also want to be able to monitor it remotely and for it to be smart without being overloaded, Ring’s Alarm is an excellent option that was worth waiting for.Pros: wireless, effective, simple to install, rental-friendly, smart but not complicated, works as well as a traditional alarm, expandable, dependable, good app, inidual pins, temporary pins, integrates with other smart devices and camerasCons: costs bit more than competitors, contact and motion sensors are fairly large, no keyfobNFC option"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8efbc520ac10c584a8e8132ef569ea21c124a56/254_386_3305_1983/master/3305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beabfd2ad2f02431aeca2460ccddf63e","title":"the country faces a bright future finland readers on their new pm","story":"We asked readers in Finland to share their thoughts on the country’s new prime minister. Here’s what some of them saidVery happy that we now have a young female PM with fresh new thoughts on how to lead our beautiful country. She is well educated, bright and does not take any BS from anybody. She is a strong independent woman and a bright new star for her generation. I’m sure she will make a good example for all the young men and women of our world. It’s the young people that need to take over as they are the ones living here long after my generation has passed. Veikko, 65, Ilomantsi, FinlandI cannot recall when politics last made me cry tears of happiness. This did. I experienced my political awakening at age 16. The power that rose from the 2015 elections four years later didn’t look like me. This, now, is what politics is supposed to look like. It is supposed to look into the future, think of the welfare of the people. Ella Kivisaari, student, Helsinki, FinlandShe’s going to have a challenging time finding a way to fund government spending and find a path to improving employment. She’s fresh, popular and brings a major improvement in communication skills but also needs to break her ties with her predecessor Antti Rinne to be able to avoid an impression of being a marionette of his. Ilkka Kivi, 48, works in IT, Espoo, FinlandBest choice for prime minister. Our political party has long needed ‘fresh air’. Sanna is very good at speaking in the media and doesn’t hesitate to say her opinion. I’m very pleased. The opposition parties will have to face a lady in parliament and I’m loving it. Finland faces a bright future with Sanna Marin! Teemu Lintumaa, 35, FinlandShe seems competent and will probably do alright, but I would say that her appointment is almost like an act of desperation from her party. The SDP is in a similar downfall such as so many former ruling parties across Europe, with their voter base leaking both to the far-right, far-left and to the greens. She is basically their only politician with star power, and they are now pulling her from the sleeve to save them from oblivion. Whether that will work is yet to be seen, but basically this appointment is about a 20th century party trying to be hip, cool and relevant in the 21st century. Mikko Damskägg, 28, student, HelsinkiI first met Sanna Marin around 10 years ago in an election panel. She stood out from the other panelists in a most positive way, with deep knowledge and formidable arguments. Over the years, she has proven herself as one of Finland’s most apt politicians. I am so very happy and proud that she is our prime minister. Jari Kallio, 46, journalist and teacher, TampereI’m super excited and happy about our new PM! I think she’s starting a whole new chapter in Finnish politics by lifting up some really important values like equality, climate change and solidarity between people. Finland has been led by more or less right-wing politicians for over 15 years and since the actual election things have started to change in Finland for the better. Sanna Marin as our new PM will surely keep our new government in order and work towards the goals set six months ago. To see a young woman rise up to this position makes me really happy. Jarkko Veijanen, 39, project manager for a telephone company, Jyväskylä, FinlandIt’s great to see women and young women on the frontline in politics. We’ve been hailed as a very equal country but even now the comments regarding Marin’s appointment still leave me speechless. Her age, education, experience in both ‘normal jobs’ as well as politics are being questioned and I’m quite sure this wouldn’t have been the case if Antti Lindtman was appointed instead. I’m so disappointed in Finns not even giving her a chance.

Shortly after news of his resignation broke, however, Global News reported that he had used party funds to pay for his children’s private school education – allegedly without knowledge or approval from the funding board.Party officials said that the use of party funds to partially cover the cost of private school in Ottawa was a “normal practice” for political parties and denied the issue was linked to Scheer’s resignation.In an emotional speech to the house of commons early Thursday afternoon, Scheer thanked his party and family for their steadfast support.Scheer, who is also head of the official opposition, received a standing ovation from parliamentarians following his speech.Justin Trudeau, whose Liberals defeated the Conservatives in October’s bitter general election, praised Scheer’s dedication.“I want to thank him deeply for his service to Canada on behalf of all Canadians, on behalf on all Liberals, and I know there are many more conversations to have,” said Trudeau, as the two shook hands. The NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, and the Bloc Québécois leader, Yves-François Blanchet, thanked Scheer for his service.Scheer – who won the popular vote on 21 October but failed to gain enough seats to form government – was unable to resist a parting shot at the prime minister on Thursday.“I believe I’m the first person in history to get more votes for Trudeau,” he said to laughter.Scheer, who was once speaker of the house under the former prime minister Stephen Harper, won leadership of the party in 2017. In the months leading up to the election, his Conservatives had polled ahead of Trudeau, but the party was unable to capitalize on a prime minister beset by scandals, leaving many frustrated with Scheer’s performance.In the weeks following the election, Scheer has become the target of scathing editorials from conservatives, most notably over his stance on LGBTQ+ issues. Sheer has refused to march in any Pride parades and has declined to give full-throated support for gay marriage – positions his critics say risk further alienating voters in much of the country.Scheer will stay on until a new leader has been chosen, and asked the party’s governing council to immediately begin the search for his replacement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0ae02041aab1cb08612b886be12e6f3425eaa56/0_107_4310_2586/master/4310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdcc7da02a3f2f28f6d55ed96597fadf","title":"brutal packed with untruths uninsipring european press on uk election","story":"Socialism or Brexit? Britain is ided in two in a ‘Hamlet-like dilemma’, write Europe’s newspapersFrance’s media have been following the UK election campaign closely and did not take long to draw their conclusions. “Boris Johnson: the liar weakening Europe,” was the splash in Le Parisien, a popular tabloid, last month.The paper called the prime minister “Europe’s bogeyman”, a politician for whom “pretty much everything is either an empty promise, economical with the truth or a downright lie.”Le Monde said this week that neither Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn looked particularly promising for Europe. It said the Labour leader was “a leftwing Eurosceptic who views the EU as a capitalists’ club” and had “never admitted that leaving will jeopardise all his fine promises of a radical social and economic reform”.But the paper reserved its fiercest criticism for Johnson. “No longer the clown, the prime minister has started to show his true face,” it said. “Brutal hungry for power fleeing the public and awkward questions disregarding parliament brandishing a nationalism and an arrogance worthy of Trump.”In its eve-of-election analysis, Libération was equally damning. The campaign had been “brutal, packed with untruths and even outright lies, bitter, devoid of substantive debate. It was also, and above all, uninspiring,” it said. Jon HenleyGerman media have been unusually blunt in their assessment of the level of debate and particularly scathing in their assessment of Johnson. “The country is moving into a new era,” wrote Cathrin Kahlweit in a leader for Süddeutsche Zeitung, a broadly left-leaning broadsheet. “It will become more insular, cultivate a less civil form of patriotism, inflict more harm on minorities. Necessary reforms – a new electoral law, a written constitution, better public services – are likely to be postponed.”Der Spiegel had a thorough look at Britain’s likely future beyond the election and came to a conclusion that runs against the tenor of the debate in the British media. “A Labour victory would be a blessing for the economy. Because in the case of a victory, Corbyn wants to negotiate a ‘soft’ Brexit deal with the EU … which should be better for the economy than Johnson’s comparatively hard Brexit.” Philip OltermannWhile Spain has endured two inconclusive general elections this year and remains in the hands of a caretaker government, it is still intrigued and appalled by the UK’s own political contortions.In a dispatch from London, El Mundo’s UK correspondent Carlos Fresneda discerned a clear drift towards Trumpism. “Bolstered by the ballot boxes and with an absolute majority, Boris Johnson could behave like a true despot and bring about a definitive split from Europe that sees British society lurch towards the US model (after all, he was born in New York).”The paper’s leader on Thursday morning was equally blunt. It said the UK was “fatally fractured” as a result of Brexit and had succumbed to populism more than any other EU country.Rafael Ramos, the London correspondent for La Vanguardia, filed a report from Tony Blair’s former constituency, Sedgefield. There he found Labour’s once impregnable “red wall” looking vulnerable. “A blue tsunami is on its way and it’s being ridden by the blond menace Boris on a surfboard emblazoned with the word Brexit and done out in the colours of the union jack.” Sam Jones The elections have largely been a muted affair in Russia, but Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the head of the nationalist LDPR party and a loose ally of Vladimir Putin, delivered a full-throated endorsement for the Tories and Brexit on Thursday.“I and the entire LDPR party sincerely wish you victory in the election today. With the support of people, you will quickly bring Britain out of the European Union!” tweeted Zhirinovsky, who is known for making outrageous statements. Zhirinovsky was probably trolling, but the sentiment is real. Russia has largely welcomed the UK’s exit from the EU as proof that the European project is coming apart at the seams.Russian TV anchors highlighted the theatrical nature of the campaign – an element somewhat lacking in Russia’s own elections. “The campaign often resembled a show, with PM Boris Johnson bringing milk to people at home, hiding from journalists’ questions in a refrigerator, and baking a pie, but mainly underlining that Brexit is a reality,” said a broadcast on the state-run Rossiya-24. Andrew Roth“Socialism or Brexit? This is the Hamlet-like dilemma of the vote in the UK,” wrote Enrico Franceschini in La Repubblica on Thursday. “Today the tribes in which Great Britain is ided are forced to mingle to choose the lesser evil: Boris Johnson, if they want to avoid socialism Jeremy Corbyn, if they want to avoid Brexit. Many, in both cases, will be holding their noses as they vote.”In Corriere della Sera, Beppe Severgnini wrote about what a Labour or Conservative government could mean for the UK. With Brexit dominating, should Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg (whom Severgnini called “the sons of Thatcher”) regain power, they would be tempted to transform Britain into “a pirate ship off the coast of Europe”, he said. “It would be a serious mistake.” Angela Giuffrida In the Netherlands, which stands to lose more than most from a hard or no-deal Brexit, NRC Handelsblad lamented a campaign “poor on substance and rich in empty rhetoric” for an election that “could change the course of Brexit, and the country”.Hardly a single moment from the past few weeks lasted longer than the one-day news cycle, the paper said, while the debates provided no new insights beyond Johnson’s “Get Brexit done” and Corbyn’s “For the many, not the few”.Both parties “promised more money and more investment, but avoided fundamental discussions about structural health, education and benefit reforms – or even Brexit,” it said.Johnson “could not explain how he would negotiate a trade deal in record time or what would happen if the talks dragged on”, the paper said, while Corbyn “was silent on Brexit, aware a good election result was only possible if both leftwing big-city remainers and working-class Brexiteers in the Midlands and north vote Labour.” Jon HenleySweden’s Svenska Dagbladet described a country hopelessly split, and in multiple directions, leaving many voters facing “an impossible choice. How is a Conservative who wants to stay in the EU supposed to vote? Or a social democrat who believes Jeremy Corbyn is a leftwing extremist?”In Denmark, Berlingske said Britain was voting in “one of the most important elections in decades”, whose outcome would “define the UK’s exit from the EU or decide whether the country get a new referendum” and whose two protagonists “represent two radically different visions for Britain”.“If the Conservative party wins an absolute majority, Britain can leave the EU by 31 January – but the UK must immediately start negotiating a future trade agreement,” it explained. “If Labour wins, there’ll be yet another referendum on Brexit. And if there’s no clear winner, it will be a big and serious mess.” Jon Henley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c2685f330e515b0f80f76609d395891684477d9/0_36_1244_746/master/1244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31b9eeae608712ea739124311afdf5b3","title":"chile plane human remains wreckage antarctica","story":"The Chilean air force has found the wreckage of the military transport plane that disappeared en route to Antarctica and recovered human remains from some of the 38 people who were on board.There were no survivors, Arturo Merino, the head of Chile’s air force, told reporters.“The condition of the remains we discovered make it practically impossible that anyone could have survived the airplane accident,” Merino said. “I feel immense pain for this loss of lives.”The aircraft, which was heading to a base in Antarctica on a regular flight, disappeared shortly after taking off late on Monday from the southern city of Punta Arenas in Chilean Patagonia.

Photograph: RTÉ News.The Clerk of Dáil Éireann has said there was a sound business case for the purchase of an €850,000 printer that would not fit into the room where it was intended to be housed. Peter Finnegan told the Public Accounts Committee (Pac) that the failure of officials to spot measurement problems, flagged in advance, was a “major blind spot” but that the purchase made financial sense. During an exchange with Sinn Féin TD Imelda Munster, over what she referred to as a “spending spree”, Mr Finnegan pointed out that the structural costs involved in installing the previous printer in 2004 were twice those in the recent case.“When we have a piece of major equipment installation it invariably involves structural works,” he said. “We are not an organisation that has the luxury of installing equipment in a green field site. We are not Google down on the docks. We are an organisation that functions from Dublin 2 in very, very cramped conditions and invariably costs arise as a result of that.”He said that even though mistakes were made, the investment was more cost effective than outsourcing printing services, which was the “most expensive option of all”. UnreliableDuring his opening remarks Mr Finnegan explained that the 12-year-old printers were becoming increasingly unreliable and costing €65,000 a year in maintenance and parts. Those costs, together with a necessary overhaul of the old system over a five year period, he said, would have amounted to some €500,000.  Deputy Munster said she was “amazed” by the argument of a “sound” business case, but Mr Finnegan insisted that it was difficult to argue that “the replacement of a printing press at €850,000 with additional costs for adaptations is not a better option than continuing with 12-year-old machinery”. On reflection, he said the absence of an architect in the decision making process was the stand-out mistake. Mr Finnegan also said he is pursuing a financial contribution from the company that provided a printer following the controversy over the cost overruns linked to the size of the machine. Mr Finnegan said manufacturer Komori could not be held liable given information it had provided on specifications during the tendering process. “Our legal people advised me that given the warnings that were given, the fact that there was limited head height, given the fact that there was the drawing sent in, that we would not be in a position to argue that Komori breached their contract,” he told the committee, adding that other avenues were being explored. “Would they be prepared on an ex-gratia basis to make some contribution or gesture to the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of this machine? That is something that I am pursuing.” Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell said the company “are not going to write you a cheque” but recommended the Oireachtas renegotiate the maintenance contract. The supply of the 17 tonne printer has continued to provoke public and political controversy since it was first reported by The . The cost of the move is now expected to run to more than €2 million. Fianna Fáil TD Bobby Aylward said he agreed with the business case but that the controversy had captured the public imagination. He said this was probably due to previous spending issues around the National Children’s Hospital and the National Broadband Plan and the related public impression that politicians and civil servants were “playing with taxpayer’s money”.

Election results from across the North are being counted overnight. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyPolitical tensions were evident during general election voting\u0026nbspin Northern Ireland as hundreds of thousands of people went to the polls to elect 18 MPs to Westminster.Voting was busy throughout Thursday with some polling stations reporting “queues stretching out the doors” early in the day.With a number of constituencies keenly fought, the Electoral Office of Northern Ireland reported that emotions were running high between personnel from the different parties.In Foyle, where outgoing MP Elisha McCallion of Sinn Féin was challenged by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, electoral office staff reported tensions between the parties’ personation agents, who check the identities of voters.In North Belfast, where DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds was trying to see off the challenge from Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, electoral staff had to take action at one polling station to remove a loyalist banner targeting Mr Finucane.Alliance leader Naomi Long said posters were also erected close to a number of polling stations in South Antrim saying supporting Alliance was “a vote for a united Ireland” and for “killing unborn babies”. She said former leader David Ford and others removed the posters and reported the matter to the PSNI.She said a banner was also erected in North Down on Wednesday night describing Alliance as being part of a “pan nationalist front”. This also was removed, she said.Stormont talksAs the outcome of the Westminster general election is assessed and analysed, the British and Irish governments and the North’s main parties are turning their thoughts to the prospects of reinstating Stormont.Northern Secretary Julian Smith has called talks to begin on Monday, with all five main parties insisting they are anxious to get the Northern Executive and Assembly restored.A spokeswoman for the electoral office said polling stations around the North were busy throughout the day.The interest in the election had already been demonstrated by the 51,273 additional voters on the electoral register compared to the Westminster poll of June 2017.Two years ago there were 1,242,698 people on the register while this year there were 1,293,971 voters in Northern Ireland.Ms Long expressed concern that while voting was busy during the day people who normally voted after work might instead be distracted by late night Thursday Christmas shopping. The indications on Thursday\u0026nbspnight, however, was that voting continued to be brisk.Leaders voteDUP leader Arlene Foster cast her vote in Brookeborough, Co Fermanagh in the Fermanagh South Tyrone constituency. As the DUP was not competing in the constituency, she voted for Ulster Unionist Party candidate Tom Elliott who was attempting to take the seat from Sinn Féin’s Michelle Gildernew.“I believe in unionists working together and I believe in representation,” said Ms Foster in a reference to Sinn Féin’s abstentionist policy from the House of Commons.Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill voted in Clonoe in Co Tyrone, which is in the Mid-Ulster constituency where party colleague Francie Molloy was seeking re-election.Ms O’Neill said she voted as a “proud Irish and European citizen” while adding that the election was an opportunity to vote against Brexit.“The British government is undemocratically dragging the North out of the EU against our wishes,” she said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood was joined by his wife Rachael and their children Maya and Rosa as he voted for himself in Derry city. He said as well as Brexit people should vote to prompt the two main parties to get back into Stormont to address issues such as the health crisis. “Use this election to send a message to the DUP + Sinn Féin to get back into work and sort it out,” he tweeted.UUP leader Steve Aiken voted for himself at Upper Ballyboley primary school polling station in East Antrim where he was standing against the DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson. He was accompanied by his wife, Beth who, originally from Georgia in the US, recently became a British citizen. This was her first vote in a Westminster election.Alliance leader Ms Long and her husband Michael voted in East Belfast where she was challenging the outgoing DUP MP Gavin Robinson.Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Photograph: Julien WarnandEPA Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he will seek a billion euro fund to support Northern Ireland and the Border counties of the Republic after Brexit in the negotiations on the EU’s next seven-year budget.Mr Varadkar is attending a summit of EU leaders in Brussels where the EU’s climate action plan and the next budget are being discussed. The leaders are also waiting for the results of the British general election.Mr Varadkar said Ireland would be strongly supporting Ursula von der Leyen’s European Green Deal and the objective to make Europe a climate neutral continent by 2050. Yet he confirmed the Government would also seek funding under the proposed “just transition fund”.Mr Varadkar said EU leaders would also discuss the next seven-year EU budget. He has previously indicated that Ireland is willing to increase its contribution to the budget. “I’m very much of the view that we should have a well-funded EU budget so that we can protect funding for CAP, Horizon, Erasmus, cohesion – all those long-standing programmes. “But also we’ll be looking for additional funding for migration and security, for climate action, and as well for Peace Plus – one of our objectives is to have a new programme for Northern Ireland and the Border counties worth up to a billion euro during that seven-year period. So they’re the kind of things I’ll be pressing at this meeting today,” he told journalists.The Finnish presidency has already proposed a much lower figure of €100 million to promote peace and cross-Border co-operation. Peat harvestingThe Taoiseach also said Ireland would be seeking funding under the EU’s “just transition” fund to help the move away from peat harvesting in the midlands, although he accepted that most of the focus was likely to be on the heavily coal-dependent countries of central and eastern Europe.“We understand that their countries and economies are very coal-dependent, but coal is a very dirty fuel,” he said. “We’re going to say to them that this is a problem that the EU can solve together, and they will be supported and they will be assisted with European funds to make that transition – just as we have to as well.”Mr Varadkar said he was strongly supportive of the way Ms von der Leyen has “pitched how we need to proceed on climate action... that it’s not about apocalypse, it’s about opportunities, and how we can deliver green growth, and how we can invest in new industries, create new businesses and new jobs, from renewable energy to electric vehicles ...”He said that in the 1940s and 1950s the European project was about “ending war on the continent of Europe”.“We know that 30 years ago it was about bringing down the Berlin wall, defeating communism and bringing democracy and prosperity and human right to central and eastern Europe. “What’s Europe about in the next 20 or 30 years? I believe it’s about countries coming together to deal with the kind of challenges that countries can’t deal with on their own – climate action is first among those, other issues as well like migration, like security, like the regulation of big corporations that are bigger than states now.” Action forumLater Mr Varadkar addressed the climate change discussion in Irish, aides said, with specialist translators for other EU leaders. Earlier Mr Varadkar joined with the prime ministers of Sweden and Denmark to form a “climate action forum”.“The aim is to pool experience, offer leadership and encourage others to take action on global warming at European level,” a statement said. “The forum will bring together government ministers, experts and officials who deal with climate action. All three countries face similar challenges from climate change, and this forum will allow common solutions to be developed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4113774.1576189910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk election 2019 exit poll decisive conservative party win predicted","story":"In what has been a bitter and isive election, here are five things that have stood out on the streets and towns of Britain over the course of the campaign. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson and his dog Dilyn (right), and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, are are seen as they attend polling stations to vote. Photograph: Tolga Akmen and Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPBoris Johnson is on course for a resounding victory in Britain’s general election, with a Conservative majority of 86 seats, according to an exit poll released after polls closed.The poll, which has been broadly accurate in five out of the last six British elections, put the Conservatives on 368 seats, with Labour recording its worst result in modern history with 191 seats.The Scottish National Party (SNP) are predicted to win 55 seats, capturing all but four of Scotland’s constituencies, with the Liberal Democrats winning 13 seats, just one more than in 2017.If the exit poll is accurate, Mr Johnson will command the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher’s third election in 1987. He will be able to pass his withdrawal agreement through Parliament without difficulty and take Britain out of the European Union on January 31st.Mr Johnson will introduce his legislative programme in a Queen’s Speech next Thursday and will bring the withdrawal bill back to Parliament before Christmas.The result would be catastrophic for Labour, which had risen in the polls in the final weeks of the campaign and is likely to prove fatal for Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.“If it is anywhere near this, it will be extremely disappointing,” Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC.The SNP’s success in Scotland will encourage the party in its demand for a second referendum on independence. And the Liberal Democrats’ poor result will raise questions about Jo Swinson’s leadership.It was Britain’s first December general election but there were queues outside polling stations in parts of London, Manchester and Cambridge as voters defied the cold, wind and rain that affected much of the country.The Conservatives enjoyed a comfortable opinion poll lead over Labour throughout the campaign, although the polls began to narrow in recent days.The five-week campaign was dominated by Brexit, the National Health Service (NHS) and the character and leadership qualities of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. The Conservatives sought to maintain the focus on Brexit, characterising the election as an opportunity to break the gridlock at Westminster by taking Britain out of the EU within weeks.Labour tried to shift voters’ attention away from Brexit to the impact of almost a decade on Conservative government on public services. The party faced questions about its handling of allegations of antisemitism and scepticism about its spending plans, which included a promise to introduce free, high-speed broadband to every home and business in the country.A man was arrested after a suspicious device was found in a polling station in North Lanarkshire hours before voting was due to begin. Police carried out a controlled explosion on what they described as a “non-viable” device and the polling station was moved to a different venue.Following a campaign dominated by Brexit and Britain’s National Health Service, voters waited outside polling stations to elect a new government for the third time in five years.The polls opened at 7am and closed at 10pm in a vote that will determine the future direction of the Brexit process and the economic direction of the UK, as prime minister Boris Johnson attempts to secure a Conservative majority.In his closing rally in east London on Wednesday night, Mr Johnson portrayed the election as a stark choice, accusing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of representing a threat to national security.“This contest is tight and getting tighter,” the prime minister told hundreds of Conservative activists at an arena on the site of the 2012 Olympic Games.Polls show the Conservatives with a nine-point lead over Labour and a YouGov analysis based on more than 100,000 interviews in the last week suggested that Mr Johnson was on course to win a 28-seat majority.But the poll’s margin of error also allows for a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party. A poll by the Daily  and Savanta ComRes, published on Wednesday night, placed the Conservatives just five points ahead of Labour.Mr Johnson has promised to secure parliamentary approval for his Brexit deal if he wins a majority and to take Britain out of the EU by January 31st. If he fails to secure a majority, the Conservatives will struggle to form a government because none of the opposition parties are willing to support Mr Johnson.The DUP, which had a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservatives after the 2017 election, opposes Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal because it could require Northern Ireland to follow different regulations and customs rules to the rest of the UK.TurnoutThere had been fears that the low temperatures and widespread showers predicted for the first December polling day in the UK in almost a century would persuade many voters to stay indoors. But early indications suggested turnout could be high, with constituents in multiple seats posting pictures of lengthy queues outside polling stations, particularly in London, and waits of more than half an hour to vote.“The biggest queue I’ve ever seen at my polling station,” tweeted one south London voter, Kelly Molloy, at 8.13am alongside a picture showing dozens waiting to vote in her Streatham constituency.Another south Londoner, Chris Schofield, said more than 70 voters were waiting in the Bermondsey and Old Southwark constituency - some of whom gave up and left during his 20-minute wait, “presumably to go to work”.“It’s about 20 times busier than it was in 2017, and for the locals and Euro elections,” the 27-year-old consultant said. “Atmosphere is very London: orderly queueing and no one is talking to each other!”Despite facing an energetic tactical voting campaign to oust him from his own constituency of Uxbridge, Boris Johnson was the first sitting prime minister in many years not to vote for himself, choosing instead to cast his vote close to Downing Street in the marginal constituency of Cities of London and Westminster.The Tories, who hold the seat, are facing a high-profile challenge from Chuka Umunna, who left the Labour party earlier this year and is contesting the seat for the Liberal Democrats.Mr Johnson arrived at a polling station in Methodist Central Hall around 8am accompanied by his dog, Dilyn, kissing the animal for waiting photographers as he left.Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was greeted by supporters and a lone protester as he and his wife, Laura Alvarez, arrived to cast their votes in his constituency of Islington North in London. Footage appeared to show the female protester, who was dressed as Elmo from Sesame Street, remonstrating with security guards and police who tried to block her, before Mr Corbyn intervened to ask: “Hello guys, can we stop the arguing please?”The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson cast her vote at a primary school in Bearsden in her constituency of East Dunbartonshire, while the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, posed for photographers at a ballot box in her home constituency of Glasgow East.Northern IrelandIn Northern Ireland, tactical voting campaigns and electoral pacts mean a number of seats will be watched closely for potential upsets. DUP leader Arlene Foster wore a union jack scarf to cast her vote for a rival unionist in her home seat of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, after her party withdrew from the constituency in a bid to unseat Sinn Féin.In North Belfast, her colleague Nigel Dodds, the leader of the DUP in Westminster, faces a threat from Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, after the SDLP withdrew to help his campaign.Speaking in Doncaster, the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, told reporters he was hoping for “very, very heavy rain” in the town on Thursday, in the hope it would depress the votes of the other parties.Man arrestedAs voting continues, a 48-year-old man has been arrested after a suspicious device was found near a polling station in North Lanarkshire, Scotland.Police said the device was discovered on the ground floor of Glen Tower flats in Motherwell at about 1am on Thursday.A cordon was placed around the building as residents were evacuated following the find. Explosive ordnance disposal staff were called to the scene to examine the item before carrying out a controlled explosion despite the device being found to be “non-viable”.People who were registered to vote at Glen Tower have been told to attend an alternative polling station at Knowetop Primary School on Knowetop Avenue in Motherwell. - Additional reporting: , PACan Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Photograph:  Oli ScarffAFP via Getty ImagesWith opinion polls classifying dozens of constituencies as too close to call, Britain’s election night is set to be a long one, with some of the most closely watched seats announcing well into the morning. Huw Edwards leads the coverage on BBC One now that David Dimbleby has stepped aside, with Jeremy Vine guarding the Swingometer and Andrew Neil on hand to grill the politicians.The polls close, and an\u0026nbspexit poll\u0026nbspbased on 20,000 interviews in 100 seats will give the first projection of the outcome. Exit polls have been broadly accurate in five of the six most recent UK elections, although they can be up to 20 seats out.\u0026nbspAs election expert John Curtice points out, in a contest like this one, five seats here or there could make the difference between a Conservative majority that will deliver Brexit by January 31st\u0026nbspand a hung parliament that will produce a second referendum that could reverse the decision to leave the EU.Houghton and Sunderland South, along with neighbouring Sunderland Central,\u0026nbspwill declare, probably remaining in Labour’s hands. But the margin of victory could offer a clue as to how Labour is faring in its traditional industrial heartland and whether the exit poll appears to be accurate. If you are not planning to stay up for another four or five hours, this is an excellent moment to go to bed because you won’t learn much for a while.South Swindon, held by justice secretary Robert Buckland with a majority of less than 2,500, declares. If the Conservatives lose here, Boris Johnson is in trouble.Workington, a Labour-held constituency in the northwest of England, is the kind of Leave-voting seat with an ageing population that the Conservatives should capture on a good night. Welsh marginal seat Wrexham declares, the first of a number of Conservative targets in Wales. If the Conservatives win Darlington, they will probably win a majority. And Sylvia Hermon’s former seat of North Down is a three-way contest between the DUP, the UUP and Alliance.The Tories hope to capture Bury North, outside Manchester, from Labour. If Labour take Hastings and Rye or Thurrock from the Conservatives, we are probably heading for a hung parliament. The Conservatives’ performance in Angus, which the SNP is eyeing, will offer some evidence of how the party’s vote is holding up in Scotland.More Labour-held marginals declare, as does North East Fife, currently held by the SNP with a majority of just two votes. Kensington, where Labour has a majority of 20, declares as does Johnson’s seat of Uxbridge.The Liberal Democrats hope to oust Zac Goldsmith from Richmond Park, and the Conservatives are hoping to capture Brighton Kemptown and Derby North from Labour. And Independent Claire Wright could take East Devon from the Conservatives.There are a few seats still to report but the result should be clear and an official declaration imminent.Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time. But it’s not proven that this technology can work at scale when combined with biomass.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDrax currently removes around one ton\u0026nbspof CO2 per day but plans to scale this up to 16 million tons a year.One of the largest carbon-capture projects in the world, Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, uses 31 per cent of all the energy it produces to collect CO2 and store it.UK will get by far its biggest carbon capture plant in 2021Ms\u0026nbspErnsting said that burning imported wood pellets by Drax was already pretty inefficient and it would become even less so if you add carbon capture, meaning you have to cut down and burn a lot of trees.”“If you increase logging that is not good for the climate. It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, has also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up quickly and effectively.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further potential environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects and it is trialling methods that do not use solvents.Drax also needs more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

should be going to genuinely zero-carbon energy,” said Ms Ernsting.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said governments and businesses had a very poor record so far on making biomass work for large-scale energy production.“Decades of inaction by heavy polluters, such as Drax, has left us in a state where more drastic action is needed to tackle the nature emergency as well as the climate emergency,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Carbon capture with biomass remains speculative and cannot be used as an excuse to carry on with business as usual.\u0026nbsp“Any action to remove carbon from the

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time. But it’s not proven that this technology can work at scale when combined with biomass.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDrax currently removes around one ton\u0026nbspof CO2 per day but plans to scale this up to 16 million tons a year.One of the largest carbon-capture projects in the world, Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, uses 31 per cent of all the energy it produces to collect CO2 and store it.UK will get by far its biggest carbon capture plant in 2021Ms\u0026nbspErnsting said that burning imported wood pellets by Drax was already pretty inefficient and it would become even less so if you add carbon capture, meaning you have to cut down and burn a lot of trees.”“If you increase logging that is not good for the climate. It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, has also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up quickly and effectively.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further potential environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects and it is trialling methods that do not use solvents.Drax also needs more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

should be going to genuinely zero-carbon energy,” said Ms Ernsting.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said governments and businesses had a very poor record so far on making biomass work for large-scale energy production.“Decades of inaction by heavy polluters, such as Drax, has left us in a state where more drastic action is needed to tackle the nature emergency as well as the climate emergency,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Carbon capture with biomass remains speculative and cannot be used as an excuse to carry on with business as usual.\u0026nbsp“Any action to remove carbon from the

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’.

If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In 2015 David Cameron’s absolute majority was 12, the difference between the number of Conservative seats, 331, and all other parties, 319, in a House of Commons of 650. But because there were then five Sinn Fein MPs who didn’t take their seats, Cameron had a working majority of 17 (331 to 314).The working majority matters to a government trying to get its laws through parliament. So Boris Johnson needs to gain just four seats to gain a working majority of one (if Sinn Fein still has seven seats). The Conservatives had 318 seats at the last election, including the speaker (Buckingham originally being a Conservative seat and counting as one this time), so four net gains would give them 322, as against 321 for all the other parties.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A guide to party manifestos in the UK electionTinder encourages users to register to vote in general electionThe list was released\u0026nbspas the deadline passed to register to vote in the general election, with the group urging people who have secured their vote in the past few weeks to make sure they use it on 12 December.Even before what is believed to have been a massive last-minute rush of applications on the final day, applications to register have broken all records, with more than 2 million made by younger voters who are disproportionately in favour of the UK remaining in the European Union.In all, some 3,850,860 people applied between the election being called on 29 October and the registration deadline at midnight on Tuesday, with a record\u0026nbsp659,666 filing applications on the final day.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailBut as many as 1.2 million of the applications are likely to be duplicate entries by people already on the electoral roll, meaning that millions more will miss out on their chance to vote on 12 December.The Electoral Commission has estimated that up to 9.4 million people were not registered, or were recorded at an old address.The Vote for a Final Say group includes former personnel from the People’s Vote campaign, which was thrown into disarray after the dismissal of senior officials prompted a walkout by staff.The group is working with\u0026nbspyoung activists from For our Future’s Sake, a campaign to ensure that the voice of young people\u0026nbspis heard in the battle for a public vote.Former director of People’s Vote James McGrory, now a senior adviser to Vote for a Final Say, said: “Time is running out to stop Boris Johnson getting a landslide. There have been too many arguments about who has the best tactical voting website or polling data and not enough action.“We can all agree that these 25 seats are critical if we’re to prevent Brextremist Tories securing total power. Now is the time for everyone to roll their sleeves up and start fighting back.”As well as recommending votes for Lib Dem candidates in seven target seats, the group urges voters in\u0026nbspOchil and South Perthshire to back the Scottish National Party’s John Nicolson. He is hoping to overturn a Conservative majority of 3,359 votes.But the other 17 are Labour-held seats where Jeremy Corbyn’s party is attempting to fight off a challenge from the Conservatives.In a reflection of Labour’s struggle to make a dent in the Tory lead in the polls, they do not even include its most marginal constituencies like Kensington, Dudley North and Newcastle-under-Lyme, suggesting that anti-Brexit campaigners fear Mr Johnson is set to sweep up a number of gains from Mr Corbyn’s party.Mr Johnson would have to improve by nine on the tally of 317 seats won by Theresa May in 2017 to hit the magic number of 326 guaranteeing him an overall majority in the House of Commons.Labour seats on the Vote for a Final Say list include some of the so-called Workington Man\u0026nbspseats in the north of England and midlands, where Tories are hoping to win over working-class Leave supporters, such as Wakefield, Warrington South and Sedgefield. The latter is Tony Blair’s old seat where strongly anti-Brexit Labour MP Phil Wilson is defending a 14.6 per cent majority.Others include Birmingham Northfield, Bristol North West, Bury North, Canterbury, Cardiff North, Croydon Central, Eltham, Enfield Southgate, Gower, Portsmouth South, Reading East, Warwick and Leamington, Weaver Vale and Wirral West.In Canterbury, where Ms Swinson controversially overruled local activists who wanted to stand aside in favour of Labour’s pro-EU Rosie Duffield, the campaign advises Remain supporters to shun the Lib Dem candidate and back Ms Duffield.Vote for a Final Say has raised thousands of pounds to advertise tactical voting advice in these seats.This will be targeted particularly at young people, working class women and ethnic minorities, who the campaign believes are among the groups which are generally least likely to participate in elections but can be mobilised when it becomes clear that the stakes are so high.\u0026nbspAmanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, the co-founder of youth referendum campaign For our Future’s Sake, said: “More than a million young people have registered to vote in this generation-defining election over the last few days. Now we must make sure people use those votes – and use them wisely.“These 25 seats could decide whether Boris Johnson gets the majority he needs to do whatever he wants of us having the chance to stop him through a Final Say referendum. Young people are traditionally the group of voters least likely take part in elections but we also have the most to lose. In constituencies where just a few hundred people could make all the difference, it is vital we make our voices heard.”Analysis of applications to register to vote conducted by the Electoral Reform Society found that the 3,191,193 entries by midnight on Monday equates to 114,000 per day and was 38 per cent higher than in the same period before the 2017 election, when 68,000 a day put their names forward.Of this year’s applications so far, 2,125,064\u0026nbspapplications (67 per cent of the total) were made by people aged 34 or under.The complete list of 25 constituencies, with the recommended candidate for pro-Remain voters, is as follows:\u0026nbspOchil and South Perthshire, John Nicolson (SNP)A so-called “youthquake” in 2017 saw a higher proportion of young people than usual take part in the general election, and was credited by some for Labour’s unexpectedly strong performance.And as the cut-off for registration grew closer, an even greater proportion of young people registered. On Tuesday, 459,668 people aged 34 or under filed applications to vote - accounting for 70 per cent of those who applied on the last day before the deadline.Dr Jess Garland, director of policy and research at the Electoral Reform Society, said: “This surge in registrations is highly encouraging, given the huge numbers missing from the electoral roll. We’re seeing a major uplift in new registrations compared to the last election, with large numbers of young people signing up too – a traditionally under-registered demographic.\u0026nbsp“It’s vital we close the demographic ides in terms of who is registered. This is a strong start.”She added: “However, since you cannot check whether you’re registered already, we estimate over a million of the registrations we’ve seen are likely to be duplicates. We urgently need to update our archaic registration system to bring in the ‘missing millions’.”The Electoral Reform Society is calling for a “registration revolution”, in which citizens are automatically registered to vote so applying is no longer necessary.Vote for a Final Say\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here on the equal-area hexagon map below you can look up your constituency, or any other constituency in the country.The first thing you might notice about map, in which every MP’s seat is represented by the same size of hexagon, is how small Scotland is in relation to the rest of the country: there are 59 seats in Scotland and 533 in England. Then there are 40 seats in Wales, and 18 in Northern Ireland, where the parties are all different.Exit poll forecasts majority for Boris Johnson’s Tory partySharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe most important thing to look out for, when the results come in, is the change since the last election. The simplest measure of this is two-party swing: that is, the net change in share of the vote between Conservative and Labour parties. The opinion polls suggest a swing of about 3 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives since 2017.That doesn’t mean 3\u0026nbspper cent of voters switching directly from one party to the other. Usually it is more complicated: people shift between voting and not voting in and out of Lib Dem or Brexit Party voting or the Conservative share of the vote could stay the same while the Labour vote drops by 6 percentage points but a 3 per cent swing means the effect is the equivalent of 3 per cent switching from Conservative to Labour.\u0026nbspIf there is a 3 per cent swing to the Conservatives, that would probably mean a historic win for Boris Johnson: anything more than a net gain of 18 seats would be the biggest win for the Tories since 1987.\u0026nbspIf the swing is the other way, though, it does not have to be large to force the prime minister out of No 10. If the Tories lose seven seats – depending on what happens to the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland – Johnson would need the support of more than the DUP to stay in office. All eyes would be on Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, as Nicola Sturgeon has already made it clear the Scottish National Party would back Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister in a properly hung parliament.\u0026nbspWith each 1 per cent of swing, about 10 seats change hands between the two largest parties, although that figure is variable, especially because the swing is likely to be different in different parts of the country.\u0026nbspLabour is expected to do better in urban seats with lots of graduates that voted Remain in the 2016 referendum, although it will be fighting off a strong Liberal Democrat challenge in some places. Labour is braced for losses, meanwhile, in seats that voted strongly to Leave, in the north, midlands, Wales – and Dagenham and Rainham in east London.\u0026nbspThe race to secure a majorityThere is bound to be some dispute in the commentary on the results programmes about how many seats a party needs to have a majority in the House of Commons. An absolute majority in a parliament of 650 MPs\u0026nbspis 326, and so that, a majority of two, 326 to 324, is the benchmark for comparing with previous elections. The opinion polls suggest we are more likely to be comparing tonight’s majority, if there is one, with David Cameron’s majority of 12 in 2015 or John Major’s of 21 in 1992, rather than Tony Blair’s of 179 in 1997 or Margaret Thatcher’s of 144 in 1983.But because there were seven Sinn Fein MPs who didn’t take their seats in the last parliament, that moves the “winning line” for a party or group of parties to have a working majority. If Sinn Fein win seven seats again (they are likely to win anything between four and eight), it means that 322 seats is an effective majority, because then a House of 643 MPs would be ided by 322 to 321.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Similarly, Chorley will be recorded by many of the results services as “Other”, but for the purposes of calculating the standing of the parties in parliament it is in effect a Labour seat. The speaker does not normally vote in the Commons, but neither do his three deputies: one of his own party and two from the other main party, so two non-voters on each side cancel each other out.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So what is it and how can you decide who to vote for Tactical voting is when someone backs a candidate they wouldnt normally support, to stop someone  winning.This often occurs in a constituency where two parties are in a tight race and candidates from other parties sit far behind.If a voter believes their candidate sits too far behind in the race to stand a chance at winning they may choose to vote for their favourite of the two who are in with a chance.In this general election, voting tactically could help MPs who share voters views on Brexit win more seats.A survey found that of , voters questioned,  per cent said they planned to vote tactically to keep out a candidate they dislike, the BBC reported.That compares with  per cent who said they would vote for their first preference - regardless of how likely they were to win.The remaining  per cent said they didnt know.Some believe that by using tactical voting, Brexit could be stopped.The website tactical.vote promises to show voters how they can ‘stop the Tories’ by entering their postcode.In the run up to todays historic vote, all the major parties released manestos outlining where they stand on key issues.Andyou dont have time to wade through all those, take our handy quiz to find out which party deserves your vote.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Haskell was big enough to pacy Wrighty, the series’ one real character, and Jenner was a waste of £, as she had everyone treading on PC eggshells and queuing up to assure us she was “an amazing, amazing woman”.Most of the rest were merely present and it was hard to have an opinion about almost any of them. Especially Adele, who had a picture of Jane McDonald rather than a personality, and Oddboddish Myles, who seemed to be using “the experience of a letime” to get his own cookery show. Not the reason most people would go in there.But a lot of this year’s contestants were young, tearful, mollycoddled, over-entitled, insecure products of our woke times and were treated accordingly by the production team, who bombarded the poor homesick little lambs with fry-ups, roast dinners, care packages, letters from home and so much food, most of them left the camp sounding like they’d just spent a fortnight at The Palms in Vegas.Roman: “That was the best thing I’ve ever done in my le.”Andy: “I loved every single minute of it.” Myles: “It’s been the most beautul time of my le.”Which was lovely for them but dull as hell for us, no matter how much they banged on about the “emotional rollercoaster ride” and missing their ruddy kids.Nor did it help Ant  Dec, who tried their brilliant best to inject laughter and running gags into the show. This, though, was one series of I’m A Celeb not even they could save.On Sunday it ended, appropriately enough, with victory for Jacqueline Jossa, who probably hoovered up the “Gloria Gaynor” block vote on account of her husband Dan Osborne’s off-screen shenanigans, which were far more interesting than anything that happened on screen.If this flat, tearful, commercially driven series got the winner it deserved, it certainly didn’t get the right epitaph from Ant.“One thing’s for sure,” he claimed confidently at the end, “We’ll never forget the class of .”And with that, I’d forgotten them.A FEW points to make regarding the BBC continuity announcer’s plug for Gemma Collins’ podcast, which kicked in during The Apprentice: You’re Fired credits.“I’ve got a great podcast to tell you about.” You haven’t.“It’s so entertaining.” It’s not.“Was Gemma Collins an elephant in a past le ” PAST FEELGOOD television story of the week Nish Kumar getting booed off stage at the Lord’s Taverners charity dinner. Proof he really hasn’t been paying attention to his Mash Report audience.If he had, Nish would’ve noticed they’re not laughing, they’re applauding in furious agreement about just how much they also hate the Tories, Boris, Trump and Brexit.Those of us who don’t share any of these left-wing prejudices, of course, are just meant to sit and meekly accept the abuse and the fact that all the least funny, most obnoxious and radioactively smug people on TV suddenly seem to have decided they’re the nation’s new moral compass and we’re racist bigots.What’s brilliant about the Lord’s Taverners story and accompanying internet footage of the audience is they refuse to play ball. At the point the clip kicks in, Nish has already lost them and is, as always, playing the race card.Half the crowd are booing, the other half are begging him to say something funny, ashe might suddenly turn into Robin Williams.A great comedian could still have turned it round and adjusted their material, of course.But Nish Kumar is neither great nor even a comedian. He’s a left-wing propagandist who cannotoutside of the tiny BBC Channel  echo chamber, so he has to be ushered off stage by the tombola bloke in red livery.It could’ve happened to any one of a number of C BBC “comedians”, obviously. The Tez O’Clock Show, The Last Leg, Have I Got News For You and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order are all just as biased and unpleasant as The Mash Report.Nish is by far the smuggest offender, though, andthe BBC is ever going to make a mass audience laugh again, instead of just lecturing us, it needs to learn the Lord’s Taverners lesson and carve these words on a comedy gravestone: “Ladies and gentlemen, Nish Kumar.

A decent majority will liberate him to secure Brexit by January .But Boris also has a zeal to radically improve Sun readers’ lives — and we would hold him to it.His rival for PM, Marxist Jeremy Corbyn, was yesterday branded a danger to national security by one of his OWN senior front-benchers, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth. A Boris victory would kill off that threat for ever.He would then be able to pour £billion extra into the NHS, hire , more cops to hammer crime, inject substantial new funding into schools and green-light multi-billion-pound, job-creating infrastructure projects.Plus, Boris will not raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT for five years.No sane politician can or should compete with the absurd freebies Corbyn claims he could dole out. Labour’s entire plan is a vast, ruinous fantasy, relying solely on the better-off sticking around to be hammered again and again for extra tax. The truth is everyone would pay for Marxist revolution.Boris, by contrast, would not bankrupt Britain. Nor wage war on private companies, as Corbyn would, and scare off investors, causing mass job losses.And, crucially, he tends to achieve what he sets out to. He ran for Mayor in Labour-dominated London and won twice. He led the Leave campaign to victory against the Remainer establishment. He was written off as a futureTory leader but won that too. He doggedly pursued, and won, the new Brexit deal every know-all said was impossible.Boris is being subjected to a tsunami of hate from Corbyn’s thugs and diehard Remainers who know he is Brexit’s last hope. Almost all of it is confected cobblers. Boris is as liberal as any of them.He is nothing like their hard-right caricature and they know it. Had he backed Remain they would love him.Boris is the right man to lead Britain into the s.

ThatCorbyn becomes PM on Friday the civil service will need to act rapidly to keep us all safe.The Sun has long considered Corbyn an unprecedented threat to our country. He is far closer to terrorists like Hamas than our No ally, America, which he detests. Our security partners would not trust him with classied information.But this taped confession tells us much about those around him too.In public Ashworth is a loyal Corbynista. In private he says Corbyn is a security threat and a loser who blocked Brexit. He longs to replace him with someone “half-decent”.He and his allies know their leader to be useless.

Thank you.The couple have raised £, so far.The family-of-nine - Ellie, seven, six-year-old twins Kenzie and Kelsie, Laysie, four, Archie, two and two twin boys, Tobie and Rylie, aged seven months - live in a three-bedroom home, which costs £ a month in rent.Mr Rodgers used to work as a waiter, but has been washing cars to pay their electricity bills.The couple said their children wanted for nothing until Mr Rodgers lost his job over a health scare last year.But his mother-in-law, Ms Grattan, told MailOnline: Ryan is a feckless liar who is trying to con the public into giving him money which he will just pour down his throat.No one should give him any money as he has a drink problem and thats where it will all go. He will spend it all on booze.Anyone who has donated to the GoFundMe page should ask for their money back.

By not supporting Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist buddies, I am - I am told - an “age traitor”. Boris is for boomers, the thinking goes, and Corbyn is for us.But scratch the surface and you’ll find that the Prime Minister - a man who made his name as mayor of London - has rather a lot to offer us young folk. And Jeremy Corbyn - a Marxist straight from the s- might just make  our lives a hell of a lot worse.Take, for example, the issue the vast majority of young people say matters to them most: housing.If you’re a young private renter, Corbyn’s radical plan to crackdown on “dodgy” landlords sounds really rather good.But there’s a serious catch. If landlords could be forced by the government to sell their homes to tenants at a price dictated by the Government, the buy-to-let market would collapse. And fast.In a few pockets of the country, where housing supply is plentul, that would be great. With landlords out of the picture, those desperate to get on the property ladder might stand a chance.In most of Britain, though, the picture wouldn’t be so rosy. Where available housing is precious and most people can’t afford to get on the housing ladderprivate renting is a blessing. And a collapse in the buy-to-let market would hike the price of it.So under Corbyn’s “fairer Britain”, those right at the start of their careers would soon be priced out of metropolitan areas.Then take university fees. Again, the idea of “free uni” sounds very tempting indeed. But under Corbyn’s regime, university tuition wouldn’t suddenly become free. It would just be paid for by the tax-payer instead of the student.What does that mean in practice  Well, it means that the  per cent of young people who opt to get a job end up at  would end up massively subsidising the  per cent who choose to enjoy three years of student le. I loved my time at uni, but I don’t see why my  year old cousin - who’s been working his socks off in the navy for three years - should be forced to pay for it.And evenyou are a student or planning to go to university, Corbyn won’t help you in any real sense. If students don’t contribute to their own education, universities suddenly have a lot less money. Which means they can’t admit as many teenagers.In Scotland, for example, where tuition has been “free” for years, fewer and fewer young people are going to university. And because the middle classes know how to game the system, it tends to be disadvantaged kids who get let down.Andyou work for yourself, which around % of Generation Z would like to do, Labour’s radical tax plan certainly isn’t for you.Even though Jeremy Corbyn has promised that only the richest five per cent of workers will face higher bills, new analysis shows that self-employed workers earning much less could be £, a year worse off under the new rules. And sole traders - ie. young, ambitious entrepreneurs who pay themselves lower salaries in order to invest in their businesses - would suffer the most.Boris Johnson might not be a hit at Glastonbury. But like a true One Nation Conservative, he believes in opportunity. And his pragmatic schemes, like % deposit mortgages, would give hard working young people a proper leg up in le.I don’t hunt, I don’t shoot, and I wouldn’t be seen dead in tweed. But I believe that a country can only succeed when ambitious young people are encouraged by the state to spread their wings and fly. Not given countless handouts by a bankrupt Government.So tomorrow, I’ll be voting Conservative with pride.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it has NEVER been more important. The stakes have never been this high.You can back Boris Johnson — who makes a direct plea to Sun readers — to secure Brexit by January  and steer us into a bright new decade as a prosperous and independent nation outside the EU.If you don’t, oryou stay at home, you risk handing power to Jeremy Corbyn’s extremists, who will reverse Brexit andus to the industrial carnage of the bleak s which his union paymasters consider a golden age.Back in  The Sun’s famous “lightbulb” front pagewarned of the nightmare of a Neil Kinnock Labour Government.That would have been a picnic compared with a Corbyn regime which threatens to drag our great country into a terrying and dark new era.Imagine you wake tomorrow to find Jeremy Corbyn, even in defeat, somehow cobbling together a Government in which the Scottish Nationalists and Lib Dems call the shots.Imagine this appalling Remainer pact drafting a new, rigged Brexit referendum and another hideously isive Scottish independence vote.Imagine them radically altering the voting rules to ensure hard-Left power for a generation.Imagine that the Pound has already crashed, hundreds of billions are being pulled out of the country and our global allies are making contingency plans to freeze out our new Marxist Prime Minister, considered a national security risk not just by them but by his own health secretary.This is not some scare story The Sun has invented. It is inevitableBoris Johnson has agonisingly too few seats for a working majority.As the economy begins its rapid descent into ruin, with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs — maybe including yours — imagine how you will feelyou didn’t go out and vote to prevent it.The Sun has warned for years how dangerous Corbyn, his creepy shadow chancellor John McDonnell and their Communist aides are.We highlighted how they backed the IRA while it was executing our soldiers and civilians. How Corbyn considers Arab terrorists “friends” while loathing the West and our No ally America in particular.We told how his anti-Semitism had drawn Jew-hating bigots to his party like flies to a cesspit and led to Labour becoming only the second party after the fascist BNP to be probed for racism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.We described how he and McDonnell revel in left-wing thuggery and foster a vicious hatred of opponents, exemplied by their repulsive social media trolls and the flashmobs that publicly vily and intimidate Tories.They have created a party of hypocrites and liars for whom no fabrication is too bigit damages the Tories they detest. A party which built an election campaign around a monstrous hood about the Tories “selling the NHS” to Trump.Corbyn was a joke once. Now, with this election as tight as it is, he is on the brink of power. It should terry every sane person in Britain. It is shocking that it does not. It is profoundly depressing to see people supposedly opposed to racism give Labour’s anti-Semitism a free pass asit is a “lesser” prejudice, even a socially acceptable one. Tell that to terried British Jews, resigned to emigrating to escape Corbyn. Or to the  former Labour MPs who yesterday begged the public not to vote for their old boss for precisely this reason.What has our country become that such a toxic, dangerous party could be within a mile of power  A party which derives its energy from grievance and hate  What has happened to our education system that the insane high-tax, business-destroying economics of Corbyn and McDonnell, which have brought ruin everywhere they have been applied, are discussed as a serious possibility  That despite mass starvation in Venezuela, which Corbyn held up as his model, his young fans still believe the same system is worth a go The answer is austerity and its successful weaponisation by a Labour Party relying on voters forgetting why it was necessary. Well, here’s a reminder: In  the global financial crisis and Labour’s scandalous over-spending left us heading for bankruptcy. Labour was borrowing nearly £billion a WEEK and left incoming Tories a snarky note: “Dear Chief Secretary. I’m afraid there is no money.”They thought it was FUNNY. The cost was nine long years of cuts, vital to get our finances back in order. These are now presented as a cruel Tory “choice”. That is nonsense. They had no alternative.But, yes, public services have struggled. The NHS is short-staffed and cannot keep pace with an older, sicker and rapidly expanding population. Police cuts have hurt the fight against crime.Homes are far too expensive for young people, particularly in the South. Many of those don’t recall Labour’s financial disaster. They just want change and an economic stake in society. But they and too many others who will vote Labour because they are sick of “Tory cuts” forget why they happened:Labour wrecked the economy. The Tories had to fix it.Boris is a dferent Tory, unafraid to spend big to pump le back into “left-behind” communities.His economic programme is far more lavish than that of Theresa May or David Cameron. He will plough billions more into the NHS, police, schools and new infrastructure projects. He has a zeal to regenerate regions that fell behind as London flourished. Mrs May talked about it.

It says “Friday th”. Then I hear a horrible cackling — and, OMG, it’s Diane Abbott standing by my bed, her face split open with mirth.“We’re in charge now!” she shrieks: “Ha ha ha ha ha.” And then the rest of the ghouls appear.Magic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn, smirking through his beard, wearing his Lenin hat. Jo Swinson of the Lib Dems like a Girl Guide Leader from Hades. And then — grinning like Janette Krankie on acid — Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP.I try to hide under the covers but Diane pulls them back. “We’re in charge now,” she repeats. “And first we’re going to wreck Brexit. And then we’re going to wreck the country. Ha ha ha ha.”Friday, December  is the day we find out who will be ruling us for the next five years. And my nightmare could quite possibly come true.I’ve been saying for ages that the idiotic Corbyn could win this election — without actually winning any more seats.It is an incredibly precarious position for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives — and thus for Brexit.The polls seem to be tightening. The Conservatives haven’t run a terribly good campaign, it’s true.All it needs is another drop in the Tory lead of one per cent and we would be heading for a hung Parliament.That almost certainly means a government led by Corbyn, with support from the Lib Dems and the SNP. It would definitely mean an end for Brexit.The democratic decision we took three years ago would be forgotten. At best there would be ANOTHER referendum.Almost certainly rigged by Labour and the Lib Dems to ensure that, this time, the right side won, ie, their side.They have no respect whatsoever for that democratic mandate. They are very clear about that. But there will be even worse to come.Labour will usher in a ruinous economic programme which the country cannot possibly afford.Our entrepreneurs will flee the country. We’ll be back in huge debt once again. Spending on stuff we cannot afford.Labour plans to spend TWENTY EIGHT times as much money as the ConservativesWorst of all, we will be led by a halfwit who supports every enemy known to this country.You name a terrorist cell or a vile, authoritarian country and mad old Jezza will at some point have offered it support.From the IRA to the genocidal Islamists Hamas, from Cuba to Iran.The brilliant website Guido Fawkes has detailed all the times Corbyn has stuck up for terrorists or horrible totalitarian governments. Gawd help us, the list is almost endless.This is a bloke who has said he wishes Nato didn’t exist. That’s the military alliance which has kept peace for  years!But don’t take my word for it. Just this week yet another Labour MP was caught moaning about how truly bloody awful Corbyn was.Jonathan Ashworth said voters were turned off by the man and that the prospects for Labour were “dire”.He added: “I’m helping colleagues, banging on about the NHS for them, but it’s awful for them, and it’s the combination of Corbyn and Brexit . . . outside of the city seats . . . it’s abysmal out there . . . they can’t stand Corbyn and they think Labour’s blocked Brexit.”That’s not “Tory lies”, as the lefties always say when someone takes a pop at the old scrote.That’s a member of his own front-bench team. But then a good two thirds of Labour MPs can’t stand Corbyn and think he would be awful for this country.As Boris Johnson said, Ashworth was only saying what hundreds of Labour candidates and millions of voters were thinking.You wonder why some of those candidates don’t have the courage of their convictions and stand down.In fact, plenty have already done so. Ivan Lewis, for example, who has urged everybody to vote Conservative.Then there was John Woodcock and Ian Austin. Both former Labour MPs, moderates. They even made placards telling people to vote Tory.More MPs left Labour long ago — such as Chuka Umunna, who is now standing as a Liberal Democrat, and Brexiteer Kate Hoey can’t bring herself to support the party she served for  years.The man and his retinue of Trots — John McDonnell, Rebecca Long-Bailey , the ghastly Diane Abbott — are a laughing stock. Except I don’t find very much to laugh about, to tell you the truth.And along with Labour and the Lib Dems will come more stupid, socially isive identity politics. The whole country ided up into competing victimhoods.Gay, transgender, black, Asian. Asthese were the things which define us as human beings.But then that’s the infantile and damaging way the Left sees the world.Given all this, you might think it incredible that Corbyn could ever get the keys to No Downing Street. So many people despise the bloke.And that’s before we factor in his repellent anti-Semitism .And you might look at the polls and think — well, the Tories still have a decent lead. Nothing much to worry about.It won’t be Friday th or Nightmare On Abbott Street. It might well be Groundhog Day, but that’s preferable. But this is the big problem for BoJo and his Conservative team. Complacency. The suspicion on the part of the electorate that Corbyn could never actually win. When he could win all too easily — and don’t forget, the opinion polls are very often wrong.The other problem for the Tories is, of course, the Brexit Party. They are still fielding candidates in seats up and down the country — seats which the Tories need to win in order to form a government.Some senior figures in the Brexit Party have already said they would be far better off backing the Tories in order to get Brexit done.But Brexit Party boss Nigel Farage will not listen to them.So we have the terrible situation where people might vote for the Brexit Party in order to make sure we leave the European Union — but in doing so actually STOP Brexit from occurring.Becausethe Brexit Party takes lots of votes from the Tories, that lets in Labour and the Lib Dems through the back door. And the result  No Brexit.It’s in those seats in the North and Midlands where the Conservatives are most vulnerable to a high Brexit Party vote.This is a crucial election. Not just for Brexit, but for Britain’s future.That means a vote for the Conservatives, no matter how much that sticks in the craw.I’ve mentioned before that the only time I voted Tory I felt pretty glum afterwards.But this time there really is no alternative except in a tiny handful of seats where the Tories cannot possibly win.Once this election is out of the way, we need a new party to provide opposition to the Tories.A party that will replace Labour. For me, that’s the Social Democrats. But we’re not at that stage yet.For now it’s a case of walking to the polling booth, holding your nose and voting Blue.You decide our government. You may have your doubts about our democracy — I don’t blame you! You may feel uneasy voting Tory — don’t blame you for that, either.But you hold the destiny of our country in your hands.Indeed, when you put that cross in a box, you ARE the government. The person who decides what is best for our country.So make your vote count, please — and banish those nightmares for ever. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

dropped off the radar screens of flight monitors in Malaysia just five seconds after it crossed into Vietnamese airspace.But the controller monitoring its progress in Kuala Lumpur was dealing with other traffic on his screen and didn’t notice it had vanished.Its been reported by the Atlantic that when he finally did, he assumed that it was now in the hands of his counterparts in Ho Chi Minh.However, Vietnamese controllers saw the Boeing  - which vanished with  on board - cross into their airspace and then also disappear.They then apparently misunderstood rules which meant they were supposed to inform Malaysia immediatelya plane did not show up.They tried repeatedly to contact the flight crww of the aircraft - which is believed to have crashed into the ocean - but to no avail.By the time they finally picked up the phone to inform Kuala Lumpur,  minutes had passed since its sudden disappearance.What ensued was an exercise in confusion and incompetence full of blunders, say those close to the long-running investigationKuala Lumpur’s Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre should have been notied within an hour of the disappearance, they say.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH took off from Kuala Lumpur and was heading to Beijing with  people on board.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.However, it eventually took more than four hours to alert rescuers - which means it is virtually impossible to pinpoint where and when it went down.Five pieces, thought to be from the Malaysia Airlines plane, later washed up in Madagascar - more than , miles from Vietnam.Aviation expert Victor Iannello believes one fragment, which appears to be from the interior floorboard, is consistent with a “high-speed impact.More than  bits of aircraft debris have so far been collected from ious places around the world over the past five years.However, only three wing fragments that washed up along the Indian Ocean have been confirmed to be from the missing flight.Its been reported earlier this year that the pilot was in control until the very end but made abnormal turns before crashing.French investigators have been given access to a considerable amount of flight data sent during the flight prior to the crash.Official documents lend weight to fears pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, , crashed into the sea in a murder-suicide, they were cited as saying.Some feared Russian president Vladimir Putin was involved in the hijacking of MH.US Science writer Jeff Wise claimed Putin spoofed the planes navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome so he could hurt the West.French ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked.Malaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested the disappearance could have been the result of a suicide.He claimed someone on board could have taken out a large le insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back the money they owed.Historian and writer Norman Davies suggested MH could have been remotely hacked and flown to a secret location as a result of sensitive material being carried aboard the jet.Malaysia Airlines found a -inch crack in the fuselage of one of its planes, days before MH disappeared.The Federal Aviation Administration insists it issued a final warning two days before the disappearance.But the Daily Mirror claimed the missing jet did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing s so it did not receive the warning.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull unexpectedly said it was “very likely that the captain planned this shocking event”.He claimed the pilot wanted to create the worlds greatest mystery.Another theory claimed that he hijacked his own plane in protest of the jailing of then-Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and as a way to destabilise the corrupt government of Najib Razak.Another seemingly far-fetched idea said the pilot had deliberately crashed the plane to cover his track as he had parachuted out of the plane so he could spend the rest of his le with his girlfriend who was waiting in a boat in the sea.In the wake of the incident, South Korea noted that North Korea nearly took out a Chinese plane which had  passengers on board, on March , .Some fear Pyongyang shot the plane down, but others believe it was hijacked and erted into the communist nation.One theory claims that because many relatives were able to hear a ringing tone for up to four days after the crash so the doomed jet could not have smashed into the Indian Ocean.Nineteen families have all claimed the devices of their loved ones rang for up to four days after the jet went missing.However, wireless analysts claim that phone firms sometimes use a phantom ringing sound when the device is not active, the Daily Star reports.In September , British video producer Ian Wilson claimed to have found the missing aircraft using Google Maps.Despite millions being spent on the search to located the wreckage, the Brit sleuth believes he has found the jet in a mountainous area of the Cambodian jungle.In response, the Chinese government used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area on the outskirts of Phnom Penh.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft which has been missing since March .An MH sleuth has claimed that locals in Cambodia told him they saw a plane believed to be the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight crashing in the jungle.If the jet was flying north then possible locations could stretch as fast as the border between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to Thailand.The Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak originally asked the Kazakhstan leader Nursultan Nazarbayev to set up a search operation in the country but this quickly got sidelined as the rescue efforts focused on the Indian Ocean.The doomed flight is said to have mysteriously “flew round in circles” and veered of course shortly before disappearing.Data from British satellites could indicate the plane was oddly circling above the Pacic Ocean in South East Asia in the moments before it vanished.Aviation expert Jeff Wise, author of the Plane That Wasnt There, said data from Inmarsat, may suggest MH was flying bizarrely during its last minutes.Usually a jet will circle at a fixed altitude after being instructed to do so by air traffic control before being allowed to land at an airport.A satellite called F had made contact with the plane in the hours after it went missing via a series of what is technically known as electronic “handshakes”.Mr Wise explained: Just as the motion of a speeding train makes the tone of its whistle go up or down, the relative motion of the satellite and the aeroplane shts the frequency of the radio signals transmitted between them.MH’s disappearance has also given rise to a slew of conspiracy theories - some far more bizarre than others.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every vote for Labour brings the Corbyn revolution a step closer.That catastrophe could easily happen this week.In recent opinion polls, the Tories have maintained a consistent lead over Labour by about  per cent - enough for a comfortable majority.But in some surveys, the gap has fallen to just  points, while one poll at the weekend suggested a Conservative majority of just .Moreover, as the last two General Elections proved, the polls can be badly wrong. The result this time could go down to the wire.What the country needs to ensure Corbyn’s defeat is a vast coalition of voters united by the one aim of keeping him out of Downing Street.This was meant to be the Brexit election but it has rightly turned into a referendum on Corbyn’s spectacular unfitness for high office.And the only result should be a wholesale rejection of his bid for power.To achieve that, all anti-Corbyn voters – no matter what their past allegiances or their personal hostility to Johnson – must vote tactically for the Conservatives.Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow Chancellor John McDonnell must be stoppedThroughout the campaign, Remain supporters have talked feverishly of the potential for anti-Tory tactical voting to stop Brexit.But far more potent would be a wave of pro-Tory tactical voting to keep out Corbyn.At the heart of such a drive must lie the millions of decent, patriotic voters in Labour’s heartlands of the North and the Midlands, who have backed the party all their lives but are now profoundly disillusioned with Corbyn.If they held their noses and supported Johnson, then Labour would face annihilation.There are already signs that this could be happening.The so-called “Red Wall” of around  Labour marginals from Yorkshire to Wales, characterised by seats like Bolsover in Derbyshire and Crewe in Cheshire, appears to be crumbling.If a new army of Red Tory voters materialises on Thursday, the damage to Corbyn could be phenomenal.This week were reports that Labour are even in trouble in Leigh, where Joanne Platt has a majority of almost , and which is only th on the Tories’ target list.Similarly, the latest poll in the Lincolnshire port of Grimsby, which has been held by Labour for generations, shows a big lead for the Tories.This mood of revolt against political loyalties was captured in the words of one café worker in Labour-held Wrexham, North Wales, who said at the weekend: “I’ve always voted Labour and my family always voted Labour. On Thursday I shall be voting Tory.”People like her recognise that traditional Labour – the party of Clem Attlee, John Smith and Tony Blair – is now dead, replaced by a dogmatic, intolerant movement dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism.The election campaign has only reinforced Labour’s unfitness for office.Lavish pledges of free services and extravagant spending increases have been dished out like confetti, shattering the last remnants of the party’s economic credibility.Meanwhile, Labour has nothing coherent to say about Brexit beyond the threat of yet more dither and delay.It is no wonder that the five million Labour voters who backed Leave in the  referendum are in such despair.Boris himself put it well on a visit to Grimsby yesterday when he said that Labour’s Brexit stance represented “the great betrayal, orchestrated from Islington by politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes.”But it is not just Leave voters who should back the Tories. Remainers who loathe the idea of a Corbyn regime should do so as well.A hard-left Government is too big a price for stopping Brexit, for which the British people democratically voted three years ago.The arch pro-EU Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, now standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency, said recently that he was “absolutely satisfied that Mr Corbyn would be a disaster in Downing Street.”Yet Grieve is making that dire possibility more likely by trying to siphon off votes from the Tory party.Indeed, all the opposition parties are acting as Corbyn’s allies, whatever their protestations.Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, in particular, could still badly split the anti-Corbyn vote in a string of Northern and Midlands seats, like Hartlepool.The latest poll in the constituency shows the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories on  per cent, a far higher combined total of Labour’s  per cent.In Doncaster North, held by Ed Miliband, Labour is on  per cent against a combined total of  per cent for the Brexit Party and the Conservatives.Further south, a vote for Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats is realistically a vote for Corbyn, just as in Scotland, support for the SNP will help to propel Corbyn into Downing Street.The choice is stark. Our country’s security, liberty and growth can only be secured by theof a Conservative Government.There is nothing to fear from the continuation in office of Boris Johnson, who stands in the long tradition of one-nation Conservatism epitomised by Benjamin Disraeli and Winston Churchill.But there is everything to fear from Corbyn’s ascent to power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Experts are forecasting Labour will not gain enough support to put the Conservativesapos hold on power in peril. Butthe predictions play out, it could see some top Tory figures ousted - with No-Deal Brexiteer Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabaposs Surrey safe seat now looking vulnerable. The pollsters are attributing the blow to the Toriesapos campaign to the nationwide tactical voting campaign targeting pro-Remain marginal seats.

The highly anticipated poll predicts Boris Johnson is still likely to win the general election with a majority of . The margin of error also means that experts cannot rule out a hung parliament.

The party is said to already be privately predicting Cabinet Minister Theresa Villiers’ Chipping Barnet seat could be lost to Labour after she held by just over  votes last time. Labour has also been pouring resources into Tory Justine Greening’s old seat of Putney which looks set for a red takeover, according to the poll. YouGov predicts tactical voting in heavily pro-Remain seats could see Tories lose control in Chipping Barnett and Putney. Labour is expected to hold key battleground seat Kensington by a whisker again after taking it from the Tories last election by just  votes.

Pollster analysis suggests the tactical voting campaign has taken a stick to his support and Labour is facing pressure to prod its supporters to give the Lib Dems their vote to topple the Foreign Secretary. The campaign to oust the Tories is playing out in marginal seats around the country as voters are urged to abandon tribal allegiances and support the party with the greatest chance of stealing a win. Mr Raab voted Remain at the  EU Referendum but has since proved himself a No Deal-backing Brexiteer in Boris Johnsonaposs Cabinet. The YouGov MRP model shows tactical voting is producing a sht towards the Lib Dems, with the party now on % and closing the gap on the Conservativesapos %. Theresa Villiers, Tory cabinet minister - Chipping Barnet   The Tories are already privately predicting they have lost the seat she held by -odd votes last time. She is only two points behind her pro-Remain Labour rival Emma Whysall in the north London battleground, which is a Remain area. Iain Duncan Smith, Tory - Chingford and Woodford Green  The welfare slasher and former Tory Party leader has a narrow two-point majority over his Labour rival. The seat on the border of East London and Essex has been a safe Tory seat since its creation in . Mr Duncan Smith has held the seat ever since, but his stronghold is looking set to change hands. YouGov is attributing his potential fall to demographic changes in the area costing the Conservatives its advantage in the area. Dennis Skinner, Labour - Bolsover  Labouraposs aposBeast of Bolsoverapos is predicted to lose his seat after nearly half a century. He has held the advantage since the constituency was created in , but his power showed signs of teetering in the  General Election when his majority fell below , for the first time. Reports suggest the Brexit debate has tested some former miners in the Derbyshire constituency which overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU. Skinneraposs Bolsover seat is predicted to go Tory, as his rival Mark Fletcher gains a three-point majority in the prediction. Caroline Flint, Labour - Don Valley  The Conservatives are predicted to steal the South Yorkshire seat the veteran Labour MP has held since . The Tories are predicted to cause a major upset for the left as Labour struggles to hold onto majority leave areas in the North. She has put in long service for Labour but her Don Valley seat is predicted to go Tory, despite her vowing to back a Brexit deal on behalf of her leave-voting constituency. Phil Wilson, Labour - Sedgefield  The veteran Labour MP may not be as big of a household name as other election hopefuls whose seats hang in the balance. But his is a red safe seat with a high profile, as the former seat of Tony Blair . The seat is predicted to go Tory by a whisker, handing power to Paul Sewell, which would see Labour lost the seat to its rivals for the first time since .  The previous MRP poll had Labour to lose  seats to the Conservatives, but that has now dropped to . Both partiesapos leaders are hot-footing it around the country as they visit five marginal seats each in their final push to win swing votersapos support ahead of polling day.

Votes are held on dferent days in dferent countries, and there are many theories behind Britainaposs Thursday tradition. One states that Friday was traditionally payday, meaning workers would be more likely to go to the pub than rouse themselves to vote. There were also concerns thatit was held on Sunday, a priest might try to influence the publicaposs votes through their sermons. Thursday, on the other hand, was market day and large numbers of people would be travelling into town anyway, so it therefore made sense to set it up then.  And itaposs been that way ever since.

The polls have Boris Johnsonaposs Conservatives tipped to win either an overall House of Commons majority or the most seats in a hung parliament.Of course, anything is possible, andJeremy Corbynaposs Labour Party does win an overall majority it would have a radically dferent impact on Britainaposs future.So how will these radically dferent forks in the road impact the state of the UK  Our head of politics Jason Beattie has outlined the dferent options facing the UK. Boris Johnson wins an overall majority Brexit: The Prime Minister plans to railroad his withdrawal agreement through Parliament before Christmas to make sure we leave the EU by January . Far from getting Brexit done this triggers the start of months,not years, of trade talks with the EU and other countries, including the US, India and Australia.Johnson has pledged to get a trade deal with the EU by December . If he fails we could face a no-deal Brexit on that date. What happens next will depend on the size of the Tory majority. If Johnson wins comfortably he should be able to play for time butit is a narrow margin then he will be in hock to the hard Brexiteers in his party. Public services: The Tories have promised more nurses, extra money for schools and hospitals and , more police officers.But their spending plans only envisage more money for the NHS, with education, councils and the Home Office spending still below pre- levels. And they depend on what happens with Brexit. If there is no trade deal the economy could slide and the Tories will not have money to invest in public services. This could lead to a stinging backlash from voters.  The UK: The Conservatives’ Brexit plans could lead to the break up of the United Kingdom.Leaked Treasury documents showed that Northern Ireland will be “symbolically” cut off from the rest of the UK because it will remain under EU for trade and there will be checks on imports between the mainland and Ulster. Nicola Sturgeon will seize on the Tory majority and Johnson’s hard Brexit to press the case for another Scottish referendum. The leaders:Jeremy Corbyn will face calls to quit immediatelyhe loses a second general election .Allies of the Labour leader will try to persuade him to stay on with a view to installing a successor who will keep the Corbynite flame alive. A bitter leadership race could pitch the left of the party against moderates who argue Labour will only win power with a new leader who takes the party back towards the centre ground. Johnson will be safe for the foreseeable future as long as his Brexit plans do not become unstuck. Jo Swinson’s position depends on how well the Lib Dems perform. There is a hung Parliament  Brexit: Everything will depend on the numbers. Corbyn could become Prime Ministerthe SNP , Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru agree to work with him.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says she will only back LabourCorbyn steps aside. If Corbyn can form a government then he has promised to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU and put it to a referendum. Buthe is unable to form a government there could another election or Johnson has burnt his bridges with the DUP butthe numbers are tight he could try to strike a deal with the Lib Dems and the SNP - but they would demand a second referendum as the minimal price. Public services: Labour will want to press ahead with its plans to raise taxes on business and the richest %.Rail, water and the Royal Mail could be brought back into public ownership. There would be a big investment in social care, the NHS and education. The SNP is likely to support much of this but the Lib Dems are opposed to many of Labour’s policies. Could scrapping Trident be the price Labour pays for the SNP support   The UK: If Corbyn can form a Government with SNP support then a second Scottish referendum is highly likely.Labour has indicated this would be an issue for later in the parliamentary term. A new Brexit deal is unlikely to isolate Northern Ireland as Corbyn is looking for an agreement that keeps the whole of the UK in a customs union. The leaders: What happens to the leaders will depend on the result and who can form a government.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI was a guest on the Jeremy Vine radio show. I was asked to talk about my experience as an AE doctor as part of an election special alongside GP Siobhan Brennan. We were given a few minutes to introduce what we perceive to be the problems in the NHS that politicians should be addressing before responding to Conservative Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth in a planned debate. However, this did not happen. At the last minute we were asked to leave the studio. We were told Matt Hancock would only consent to an interviewwe first left the room. All of this happened during a live broadcast in which Hancock went on to disingenuously praise the efforts of NHS staff to the listening public whilst in reality being too scared to even speak to us. Iaposve never spoken on a live media show before as frankly Iaposm terried. I’m not a aposmedia-savvyapos person. When asked to do this interview I immediately refused but when no-one  came forwardI realised thatever there was a time to say what I felt, it was now. I have always had strong views about the political context in which I do my job, and have always felt thankful that I donapost have to work in a toxic private system like the United States. Despite its rusty edges and leaky ceilings, the NHS has always been accessible to the community I live in and people’s ability to pay hasnapost affected whether or not I can help them. Since the  Health and Social care Act was introduced this has slowly become a distant memory. I believe most of what we think of as the fundamental principles of the NHS have now been eroded - I now have to consider whether a patient will be able to pay for their care before treating them. The government have established a cruel infrastructure for charging people who they deem ineligible for free healthcare, and it’s us as NHS staff that have to enforce it. Drugs are routinely unavailable because big pharmaceutical companies have monopolies on making and selling them. This means that we can’t access medication we need to treat common conditions in emergency scenarios and patient care becomes less safe. And now Iaposm facing an election whereelected to government it seems likely the Conservatives will open the NHS market to US trade deals, meaning our healthcare system, originally set up to provide aposfree at the point of access care to all who need itapos, will be run with multinational corporations making a profit from the work I do every day - treating vulnerable people on one of the worst days in their lives. I wish I’d been given the opportunity to speak to Matt Hancock. I would have told him how privatisation of our NHS so badly affects the job I do. Thereaposs a mis-held belief thatdoctors and nurses’ salaries are still being paid by the government and aposmost peopleapos still get free healthcare, then the NHS has not yet been privatised. But privatisation is everywhere. Many staff I work with are now employed not by the NHS on decent terms and conditions, but by subsidiary companies who have taken over contracts to provide estates, portering, security and catering. Privatisation is in the car parksthe drugs we use, the operations that we pay private hospitals to aposhostapos to reduce waiting lists and the card machines used to charge migrants who probably canapost pay anyway. Keep Our NHS Public have shown us over the last decade how privatisation has been a slow burning affair, purposefully kept away from the public becausethey really understood the full implications, there would be riots. In the debate on Jeremy Vine before us Andre Jones implied that we shouldn’t ‘be bothered’ about who cleans the toilets or does the deliveries. This is a total disregard for the importance of cleanliness and other support services in hospitals.  Just as I am likely to do my job better with better training and fairer terms and conditions that enable me to work well, so are the cleaning staff who are integral to the day to day ing of the hospital. Thanks to the other guest Owen Jones who reminded us that we will be a weaker partner in a trade deal with the US and will likely be forced to open the NHS to US multinationals. And all these things are privatised in the name of aposcost savingapos whilst the politicians deny its even happening and Johnson gets to spout his insincere line about the NHS being a aposnational treasureapos. Matt Hancock talked a lot about increasing staff numbers as part of the solution. This is something the Conservatives have been talking about for a long time, and they havenapost improved things at all. Staff morale is at the centre of chronically low staff shortages and current doctors are looking to take early retirement because the job is too much. There are currently , vacancies in the NHS. This includes , vacant nursing posts. Simultaneously in the last  years, we have tragically lost  nurses as a result of suicide. Unhappy staff cannot treat vulnerable patients well. The very first line of the General Medical Councils aposduties of a doctorapos tells us that we should aposmake the care of your patient your first concernapos.

In key Labour seats, students have been flocking to polling stations to make sure their voices are heard.Photos from across the country, from Manchester to London and Nottingham to Cambridge, show long queues outside.

The monarch is entitled in law to cast a ballot in general elections, but royal tradition sees her choose to abstain. By convention the Queen doesnapost vote, rather than because of a legal impediment, says an Electoral Commission spokesman. Historian and author Sarah Gristwood says itaposs consistently been a policy of this Queen, since her early days as head of state, to stay completely above the fray. It follows on from a major reinvention of the monarchy following the end of World War One and the establishment of the House of Windsor. Even though she doesnapost vote, the Queen does have a very important role to play after the results have been announced.  The leader of the winning party will travel to Buckingham Palace where they will have a meeting with the Monarch during which she will ask them to form a Government on her behalf.

I still remember the asthma attacks I suffered during my school days, which stopped me from pursuing athletics. In , nine year old Ella Kissi-Debrah died from a fatal asthma attack in Lewisham, following exposure to unlawful levels of pollution near her home. Young people cannot afford more excuses from parties on why they are not prioritising the environment. Our health is suffering, and across the world our peers are already dying from the climate crisis - with indigenous communities affected the most, as advocates such as Canada’s Autumn Peltier remind us. In the last year, we have seen children rise up in their hundreds of thousands to demand international climate action. In my work on sustainability, I have seen a real increase in the understanding that young people must be central to the conversation. Despite this, Greta Thunberg made headlines this week for saying that the global school strikes she has inspired “have achieved nothing”, as levels of CO continue to rise. I, however, think we can credit the determination showed by striking students for the increased focus on the climate crisis in this election. Nonetheless, Boris Johnson clearly felt the climate was not a sufficient priority - not even turning up to Channel ’s first-ever general election climate debate. Despite such discouraging signs, I feel that the climate crisis is of such grave importance that we can’t afford to limit ourselves with partisan politics. Whichever party makes it into power, I hope that they see it as an imperative to boost their engagement with young people’s voices on the environment. This was begun this year with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairshearing recommendations on climate from the British Youth Council’s Youth Policy Advisory Group.

London Fire Brigade have warned parents and teachers away from using real candles around children after the horric accident. The boy, believed to be aged between  and , was rushed to hospital via air ambulance after he was seriously burned. His condition is said to be critical but stable. Witnesses said his costume was completely engulfed in seconds after he fell forwards while holding a candle at Our Lady of the Annunciation Church in Croydon. Two adults, thought to be teachers, were also burned and taken to hospital via road. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner for fire safety Dan Daly said: This horric accident is a stark reminder of the risk real candles can pose. They are a completely unnecessary hazard when it comes to children and school plays. Sadly this isnapost the first time we have seen clothing and costumes set alight by candles and people need to recognise the risk and prevent these incidents from happening again. People should not be using real candles - especially around children, costumes and decorations - when there are far safer alternatives available.  The fire chief advised parents to choose LED candles over flame ones and to be particularly careful around potentially flammable Christmas decorations and costumes.The childaposs father was seen crying and heard shouting my son, a local shopkeeper told The Sun .Noel Campbell, head teacher of St Thomas Becket Catholic Primary School where the boy is a pupil, said: Our whole school community is devastated by the incident that occurred at our carol service yesterday. Our thoughts and prayers are with the child and his family at this dficult time. Following this incident, our pupils, staff and families are being given support.  London Ambulance Service attended the scene on Wednesday afternoon and later called officers from the politan Police, who are not investigating the incident. The Health and Safety Executive was also informed. Croydon Council will now review the incident with the school, the Archdiocese of Southwark and London Fire Brigade. A council spokesman said: Our thoughts are with all those affected by this very sad incident and we are supporting staff, pupils and the wider school community.

Juliet Blaxland, , told the Mirror in September that she believed her home, one the furthest east in the UK, would be safe for at least five years. But violent autumn storms, alongside big tides, triggered a dramatic increase in erosion, with nine metres of land lost in the past four months. After the .-metre section fell away overnight in a “cataclysmic event” last week, engineers found the row of three cottages was now  metres from the clf and unsafe. Juliet and husband Giles Stibbe, , will move home next week. Juliet said: “We knew all along it would eventually be demolished but it has caught us by surprise, as we could have reasonably expected another year here. “But ever since we moved in we were always aware of how little time we had left.  “Demolition is incredibly sad. It’s the end of an era.” She said that the house is a “landmark” in Easton Bavents, East Suffolk. The village, north of Southwold, used to have a church, a thriving market and many houses. But unrelenting erosion has virtually des­­troyed the community. Juliet and Army veteran Giles moved into the ham­­let  years ago, renting from the local farmer. Since then they have seen the demolition of several houses and the disappearance of the land between them and the sea. And engineers have now told the farm owner that all cottage tenants should leave. Demolition crews are expected to raze the homes over Christmas.  Architect Juliet and Giles are moving up the coast to the village of Benacre. The area suffers from erosion, too, but their new home is far enough inland to be safe... for now.

Angel Farley has written and delivered , greetings cards so far this year in her mission to put a smile on peopleaposs faces at Christmas. The brave -year-old was born without a femur and hip socket meaning her lower leg was attached directly to her hip until an operation last year to remove the limb. Despite her limited mobility, the thoughtful youngster decided to start sending Christmas cards to lonely people in her village two years ago. The idea was born when the schoolgirl asked her mum who  she could send cards to apart from her classmates.Mum-of-four Holly Farley, , said: It just got me thinking. I spoke with Angel about the idea of asking on Facebookanyone would like a card from her.Thataposs when she told me that she thinks it would be nice to send cards to other people with disabilities and other people who might be forgotten at Christmas. It just went from there. But in February last year, Angel and her parents decided to have her right leg amputated above the leg to improve her mobility.  Holly added: She used to do what we called a apospirate walk.apos She had to swing her leg out sideways which made her hip swing and caused her spine to curve. She wore a prosthetic leg as well, but it had to be straight because it was attached to her foot and ankle, which of course, bends.The amputation at Great Ormond Street Hospital initially seemed to have gone well, but her leg became extremely infected, and was hospitalised for two months while battling sepsis .Holly said: It was a really hard time for us. I asked doctors whether she was going to survive and they couldnapost give me a straight answer. Angel has since made a strong recovery and thanks to a new prosthetic leg, is able to move much more freely than before.  Holly added: During her recovery, people in the village we had never met donated money for Angel. It was a real eye opener. We felt like we needed to do something to show our appreciation so decided to expand the card giving. The mother and daughter duo have delivered more than a thousand cards, more than ten times the total they delivered in . Angel and her family, of Iwade, Kent, have spent about  hours filling out all of the cards by hand since they began in early November. The message inside reads: From our house to yours. Happy Christmas. Love from Angel and Family. Angelaposs dad, Rob, said: We donapost want it to become a chore, so we only do it when the girls want to. Angel and her nine-year-old sister Mikayla sit at a little table and fill them in, bless them. Last year Angel and her mum received private messages from some parents whose children were autistic and would appreciate a card because they are often ignored over Christmas.  Holly added: Itaposs all about making people smile at Christmas. We go around the village as a family most evenings. Sometimes Angel finds it dficult to access properties because of her disability, but she does her best. Holly said her daughter has been flooded with messages of thanks and support from people on Facebook. She added: After what we went through last year we feel so lucky to have Angel with us. We are so happy to be able to give something back to the people in the village. Itaposs a really special community.

Her daughter Lauren Bowers, , from East Belfast, said: “We’re devastated to be separated from Mum knowing that she’s lying in a London hospital with a cancer that’ll kill her. “To know that she actually does have a chance to surviveshe gets surgery is wonderful, but to know they somehow can’t get the surgery organised is devastating - every day she’s getting worse. “The days have turned to weeks and hope has turned to despair and now she just wants to come home and face the consequences - but we know they would be fatal for her. “We were frightened for her having to travel to London for the surgery in the first place, but she’d no choice because the surgery is so complicated she needs a specialist team who can come together at the Royal Brompton Hospital. “The surgery is to remove a tumour that is wound around her spine and organs and it will take between  and  hours. “So when we got the call to get her over to London we were terried but we jumped at the chance. “My sister and her partner assisted mum on the journey and we assumed she’d have pre-operative tests and then surgery. Everyone was primed for it, we were trying to be brave and then we got delay after delay.  “And  days on we’re still waiting and mum is getting worse. She was facing into her th birthday today with some hope but it’s fading fast. Why take her all the way to Londonthe plan to operate just fades away ” Lauren added: “She went undiagnosed for almost three years and was given a number of dferent diagnosis. “The pain she was going through was horrendous, told she had bowel polyps, then erticulitis but in the end it was a team at AE who finally put her through the right tests and discovered she has soft tissue cancer. “She was admitted to hospital on morphine and the tests took six weeks to come back. It was cancer and it needed treated fast but it was another five months before anyone could say what was actually needed.  “She had chemo but reacted very badly to it and couldn’t continue with the treatment. “So the tumour was left to grow and it needs to be removed by surgery to give her a chance. “We were told the risks. The surgery could leave mum paralysed or it could kill her. But not having the surgery will kill her. “So her only chance is to have the operation and hope it goes well. “If the tumour is able to be removed in full, mum has been told she should make a good recovery. “We put our fears to the back of our head and got our hopes up and we were promised in August she would be operated as soon as possible.  Now it’s mid-December and mum is still lying in the specialist hospital far away from home and we’re no further on. “That tumour has been given five months growing time while we are still being promised the world and being let down repeatedly. “As a family we’re devastated and disgusted and we have lost any hope in our system. “Mum’s in London for specialist care from a specialist team. She cannot go anywhere , she cannot risk coming home. “Her physical health is deteriorating, her emotional and mental health is under huge pressure. “She was told she’d be operated on and recovered well enough to be home for Christmas. “But now we’ve been told the three specialist surgeons have not been able to get a date in their diary when they’re all available at the same time.  “The NHS is under enormous pressure, the staff are too and my mum who was a health care worker is the person paying the price. “We have every faith in the work of the medical teams butthey cannot actually manage to move my mum off the hospital ward and into surgery, then what hope do we have  “I would like someone to tell me why my lovely mother, who has cared for people all her working le, is being treated like this.

The figure is three times as high as the number known to have contracted the condition in the same period last year. It is thought a dip in the number of children getting MMR japs in the past  years is to blame. Health chiefs are urging people to get vaccinated, warning that dodging jabs can be fatal. Among the affected universities are Edinburgh, Cambridge, Oxford and Bristol. Back in the late s, disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield suggested there was a link between the MMR vaccination and autism - making many reluctant to get it done.  Simon Stevens, of NHS England, told the Daily Mail : Mumps is infectious and causes serious health complications, and the stark rise in cases is another reminder that opting out of protective jabs like MMR is dangerous and can make preventable diseases fatal.Dangerous misinformation about vaccines and falling uptake are a public health time bomb. Dr Doug Brown, of the British Society for Immunology, added: To curb this continuing spread of mumps we need  per cent of people to be vaccinated – a target that the UK has not reached for some years – and we are now seeing the effects of this failure. This important study set out to investigate some of the claims spread by MMR jab sceptics and fearful parents. The researchers behind the Danish study had also worked to disprove a now-disbarred gastroenterologistaposs Andrew Wakefieldaposs claims about the links between the vaccine and autism back in . Their latest paper is in the Annals of Internal Medicine , which is published by the American College of Physicians.They studied , children born in Denmark from  through to December , which is the biggest number studied to date. The researchers then followed up when the children turned one, and again in August . They looked into whether there were any links between the vaccine and autism to address criticism raised by the anti-vaccine lobby.Some vaccine doubters have claimed some groups of children are more susceptible to vaccine-caused autism.The researchers found this theory is . There were , children in the Danish study diagnosed with autism.But the researchers found no link between being vaccinated and the disorder - even in children who had autism risk factors like having a brother or sister who has been diagnosed with the disorder. Mumps is a contagious viral infection that can be spotted by painful swellings under the ears. It can lead to serious infections such as glandular fever and tonsillitis, and in extreme cases can turn to meningitisit moves to the outer layer of the brain.

Laura Cain, , gorged on takeaways and scoffed her way through bread, barm cakes, butter, and chocolate, alongside cups of tea every day. But her seven-year-old son inspired her to lose weight so they could enjoy a longer le together. Laura, who at her heaviest weighed  stone, told the Liverpool Echo: “I thought I would be dead by now. Never did I think any of this would happen for me. “I have always been overweight. I was one of these people who join Slimming World, do it a while then give up. I also tried Weight Watchers, and those awful shake diets. “Over the last  years, I have struggled a lot with my health.

She was so ill afterwards, she had to learn how to walk again and tragically three years later, in , Laura contracted meningitis after giving birth to her son, Domanic. While fighting back from those traumatic episodes, brave Laura also had to contend with living with brittle asthma and fibromyalgia, and has also developed a huge hernia. Four years ago, Laura was referred by her asthma consultant to have weight loss surgery.  But a doctor told her the operation would not be possible until she lost enough weight. The mum said she tried ious ways of losing weight, but was making little headway until  when she began noticing inspiring posts appearing on Facebook by local Slimming World consultant Dee Wright. Laura said: “Dee and I messaged each other a few times but the thought of going to a new Slimming World group scared me. I kept thinking I was going to get judged. “But I knew one girl who was already a member at Deeaposs group.  She told me what a lovely group it was and how amazing Dee is, so that was it - I braved it. I got a taxi right to the front door and walked in to Dee welcoming me and give me a huge hug. “I stayed there for about seven or eight months but it just wasnapost the right time. My weight wasnapost shting, my head wasnapost in it. I tried a shake diet afterwards and that wasnapost working either so I gave up. However in December  Laura got a postcard through her door from Dee, saying encouraging her to . Laura walked back through the doors on January  to another big hug from Dee, but then got a huge shock. She said: I stood on the scales and was shocked to see I had hit  stone. It was horrible.”  Laura was given a target of losing two stone before her weight loss surgery, which she managed to do before going into hospital for her operation on April .  And that was the start of her fight to get her le back. Laura said: “I was so scared and nervous. I had never had surgery before.  “All I kept thinking was that I was doing this for my health and to be here to see my son grow up. “If it wasnapost for Dom, I wouldnapost be here.  “So I had surgery. I had a gastric sleeve which basically meant they removed two thirds of my stomach. It has made my stomach smaller so I canapost eat as much.  Laura, who went to school at Stanley High School in Southport, swapped her unhealthy ways and transformed her lestyle. Instead of fatty foods Laura now enjoys grape nuts or Weetabix for breakfast, tuna with salad or jacket potato for lunch Slimming World meals for tea. And now the mum has lost a third of her body weight - trimming down to an impressive  stone and seven pounds.  The mum added: “I could still eat badlyI wanted too, but I donapost. I stick to food optimising with Slimming World. I attend group every Wednesday for the love and support and amazing tips I get there. “If it wasnapost for Dee and her group I could not have done this. They supported me % and that is what I need and love. “I know I have haters out there who say I am cheating because I have had weight loss surgery but in fact no - it is just a tool to help me. “I have just been awarded my  stone award and I am now in the  stone bracket! I canapost remember the last time I was in the teens bracket.  “I still have a very long way to go. I have had a scan ahead of a possible hernia operation and now it is just another waiting game.

In its idyllic rural setting, with apple trees and a lake for fishing, the home is far from the residential care institutions people imagine. This is particularly important for Rory, who has never lived in a children’s care home before. It certainly helped to be able to bring his four chickens with him to the home in Tan-y-Bryn, North Wales. He says: “I’ve had a lot of help to get settled in. It’s been extremely important to have the chickens with me. I hatched them and they wouldn’t be able to survive with someone . “I feed them, water them, empty their pen, put down new hay and collect their eggs. They’ve settled in really well.” His home is run by Action For Children, for which generous readers have already raised £, in our Give Kids a Cracking Christmas appeal.

It is the only country to conduct one as of yet. Data analysis indicates the Boeing -ER flew over the Indian Ocean until it ran out of fuel and violently slammed into the water with  people on board. It is suspected the planeaposs passenger cabin was deliberately depressurised by Shah to kill everyone on board hours before the crash.  Before doing so, he could have put on an oxygen mask in the cockpit so he could continue to fly the aircraft for hours. At around the same time the cabin was depressurised the electrical system was deliberately turned off, making the plane impossible to track by satellite. An FBI inspection of Shahaposs Microsoft flight simulator at home showed he had tested a flight roughly matching the path of MH, ending in the Indian Ocean after running out of fuel. His voice was heard in the final radio communication less than two minutes before the plane began to ert from its flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March , . One of his lelong friends told the Atlantic that he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that Shah deliberately crashed the plane, given the evidence amassed by independent investigators.  The friend, who wasnapost named, said: “It’s hard to reconcile with the man I knew. But it’s the necessary conclusion.” The friend said Shah likely tricked his inexperienced -year-old co-pilot, Fariq Hamid, who was on his final training flight, into leaving the cockpit and locked him out. He said: “Zaharie was an examiner. All he had to say was ‘Go check something in the cabinapos, and the guy would have been gone.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man pretended mum driving test","story":"NewsMan pretended to be his mum to take her driving test - because she kept failingCar mechanic Heitor Schiave, from Brazil, dressed up as his mum Maria, , in an effort to fool his instructor - but she spotted his big hands and awkward manner and called policeShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsHeitor Schiave pretended to be his -year-old mum Maria, who had failed her driving test three times\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Everybody in this league would want to add quality to their squad.“Looking at the bench on Saturday at Arbroath, we are a bit short. If we get a couple of injuries then you are short but you are always looking to improve anyway.“I’ve said before, I don’t want to go back to chopping and changing  players or whatever every window. That has happened for a number of windows at this club and that has to stop.“That’s why we were so busy in the summer so we don’t have to keep doing that. It has taken a bit of time to get everything right since then.“We are looking where we are short and what we can add but it has to be quality not just to add numbers to bulk up the squad for the second half of the season.”Next up for the Dark Blues is a home clash with one of the form sides in the ision at the moment, Dunfermline.Since Dundee have taken just one point from their last , Stevie Crawford’s Pars have racked up three wins on the spin.“It shows you what can happen,” added James. “We’ve kind of switched.

hoping to win the seat again for the Tories, claiming to be “confident but not complacent” of success.Mr Bowie, who turned over a , SNP majority in  to win the seat with % of the vote, said Brexit and Scottish independence are the two main topics on the doors, but added voters in the north-east also feel “short-changed” by the SNP government in Scotland.He added: “There’s only been one choice, either the SNP or myself as the Conservative.“Brexit and independence are the two most dominant issues.“I think there’s a real desire for politicians to stop talking about those issues and get on with the day job and issues like the health service, broadband coverage and education.”The Conservative candidate claims voters in the constituency have had enough of the north-east being used as a “cash cow”.He added: “One of the constant refrains from voters is they want the north-east to get their fair share.“There’s a recognition that we’re the only party standing up for the north-east of Scotland.”However, he is facing off against SNP candidate Fergus Mutch, the SNP’s former head of communications and research, who thinks voters in the region realise they’re getting a “great deal” compared to the situation south of the border.He said:“A whole range of issues come up on the doors and we have an extremely well-informed electorate in Scotland.“There’s a combination of constitutional politics, people seeing the damage of Brexit, something they didn’t vote for largely in Aberdeenshire.“They’ve completely changed their minds in a lot of cases on the issue of Scottish independence.“They maybe voted No in  for security, stability and the quiet le and they certainly haven’t had that over the past few years.“When you set out to people what the SNP in government is delivering for them here in the north-east they actually realise what a great deal they’re getting compared to the south of the border.”Mr Mutch added that while the Tories’  campaign strategy, which put opposition to a second independence referendum front and centre, may have worked to “some degree”, he doesn’t think it will work this time round.He said: “My feeling is that may have worked for them in  to some degree because people thought this offered the security or quiet le that they craved after a few years of constitutional turmoil.“That’s proved to not be the case and people are looking to the next  years of the UK trying to cut trade deals with the rest of the world just to bring us back to where we are now.”Scottish Liberal Democrat candidate John Waddell, who came in

was involved in an organ swap where his we Lesley offered one of her kidneys to another patient, with Colin receiving a matching one from someone .With both her parents bed-bound and recovering, Hannah combined her exam studies with looking after them for eight weeks.Yesterday, she graduated with a : BA honours degree and celebrated with her family.She said: “It feels good to say that I have made it to graduation after a hard four years for all of us.“It was dficult both at home and trying to find the time to study at university, but I feel great that I’m graduating.“Looking after them never bothered me at the time and I just got on with it.”Colin suffered a heart attack four years ago and had been on kidney dialysis until his le-saving operation on November  last year.He continues to have ongoing health problems but no longer needs round-the-clock care.Lesley hailed her daughter for being a le-saver during the couple’s vital recovery.She said: “We are incredibly proud of her and can’t believe she’s done it after everything she’s had to endure.“We could not have done this without Hannah’s invaluable help and are amazed that she got up every morning to look after us and go to university as well.”Colin added: “We got a chance of a kidney but it was no use, so my we stepped in and we did a three-way swap and Hannah looked after us all.“I think she would have got a firstit

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd.

Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"ardfern first responders recognised after saving mans life","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ardfern First Responder group was nominated for the  national Scottish Ambulance Service awards after their rapid action saved a Barbreck man#s le.There were seven other groups on the shortlist and the Ardfern groupThe Scottish Ambulance Servicesaid of the Ardfern group: #The team gives the community a sense of safety and support when an emergency happens in this remote area.#The volunteers of this group display exceptional leadership skills and clinical skills and always ensure a great handover to SAS staff when they arrive.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him. He obliged by standing to attention and snapping a salute, what a bonus. Perfectly exposed and works well in monochrome, great shot Alistair.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-review-can-go-anywhere-traverse-edinburgh-four-stars","story":"I Can Go AnywhereTraverse Theatre, EdinburghNeil CooperFour starsThis is very definitely the modern world in Douglas Maxwellrsquos of-the-moment new play, which brings the desperation of a broken Britain close to home.

There will be applause and celebration for whomever in the current shower ldquowins on Friday, but what we should really be lauding and honouring is the faith of these iniduals who have voted against all the odds.Linda Holt, Anstruther.HAVING witnessed many of the mixed and often dishonest messages emanating from political parties ahead of, in my opinion, the seminal election of my  years holding the democratic franchise, I prepare to head to the polling station with a doom-laden sense that democracy is dead.Three reasons bring me to this profoundly sad conclusion, both encased in the assertion that choosing the next government is very far from a fair fight.Instead, itrsquos a game rigged in favour of a tiny percentage of the UK population, who will benefit richly and disproportionately from the probable re-election of a Conservative administration, and they do not include the flock of mainly-English electoral turkeys prepared to vote for Christmas.First, having examined recent Electoral Commission data on single donations of pound, or more to UK political parties, the Conservatives have hoovered up pound. million of the pound.million donated since the election was called last month, twice as much as the rest combined.So, why on earth, in st century Britain, should the poundm donation to Tory coffers by a former Russian finance ministerrsquos we, and similar amounts gted by other tycoons , be able to purchase enhanced and privileged influence than me or the mythical \"Workington man rsquo\"Buying influence, in any other walk of le, can constitute fraud and, in my view, this is part of the same ugly narrative exposed in Neil Mackayrsquos excellent recent article, \"The Prince and the PM ndash twin symbols of everything that is rotten in Britain\" .Secondly, in addition to an election \"war chest\" three times bigger than anyone , the Conservatives have  per cent of the national print media in their pocket, relentlessly and enthusiastically pumping out page after page, day after day, of Tory propaganda alongside damaging anti-opposition content, successfully aimed at actively discrediting any and all dissenting voices.They have the cash to purchase advertising ndash a signicant proportion of it lodged with their loyal media backers ndash paying for armies of analysts and pulling fast-tricks any political party should be thoroughly ashamed of.That, combined with slavishly-favourable PR coverage most editors would normally dismiss as \"puff\" makes the Tories odds-on favourites for this, and any other future expression of so-called \"democracy\" conducted under the current rules, such as they are.Until such time as party funding is properly ndash and fairly ndash controlled and paid for proportionately from the public purse, and before the print media is regulated as broadcasters are, I ask the question: Is it even worth voting  in a blatantly and cynically rigged system where the deck is stacked so firmly in favour of one participant, and one participant only.And, thirdly, the UK has not had a government with a majority of the popular vote since , a first past the post system surely and urgently in need of a stewardrsquos inquiry Mike Wilson, Longniddry.ELECTION campaigning has drawn to a close, and by the time you read this letter we may know the result.But something that has concerned me this time is the sheer number of campaign leaflets coming through the door. There seems to be a correlation between the parties who are spouting the most about saving the planet, and those who are sending the most leaflets. The Lib Dems are easily the worst, closely followed by the SNP.How many trees have been destroyed Geoff Moore, Alness.I WAS impressed with politicians empathy with the crisis in our environment, until I watched them all scurrying round the country before Polling Day ... quite a \"footprint\".James Watson, Dunbar.Read more: General Election : weather to make it tough for voters"},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-big-questions-snp-must-now-answer-independence","story":"As a result, independence, which has been a rumbling constant in the national debate since , will come roaring back into Scottish le. All minds will be focussed on the prospect of a second independence referendum. Scotland will become the political crucible in which the UKrsquos future is forged.As this new chapter looms, we need to learn lessons from the election which is just ending. The campaign has raised many questions which need answered before Scotland can deal sensibly with the issue of its constitutional future.Most of these questions must be answered by the SNP and the broader Yes movement ndash as the matter in hand is independence. However, unionists have plenty of issues they must deal with too, as does the media.Letrsquos deal with the media first. Irsquom a journalist, so I should address the problems in my own house before looking at others. The media has failed the people at this election, or rather I should say, the BBC and the right-wing London press has failed.The right-wing press is what it is and what it has always been, and that will not change. Its hysterical, partisan ferocity is a continual un-healing wound which tarnishes the industry and the great number of hard-working, decent journalists in Britain, and the publications they work for, which are striving to tell the truth and do a pubic service.Just look at the way the story of the little boy lying on a hospital floor was treated. The Yorkshire Evening Post broke the story, The Mirror picked it up and ran with it, and then right-wing journalists, like the Daily rsquos Allison Pearson, peddled fake news that the image was staged.When you hear someone say lsquonever trust journalistsrsquo, we all know what papers theyrsquore talking about.The BBC has trashed its reputation throughout this election. When senior reporters like Laura Kuenssberg tweet out fake claims saying Labour supporters assaulted an aide of Health Secretary Matt Hancock, theyrsquore destroying journalism. Itrsquos simply disinformation. A student journalist knows that you mustnrsquot disseminate information without checking and confirming.Perhaps, the biggest election row was Boris Johnson refusing to be interviewed by Andrew Neil. However, many felt more than a little uncomfortable about the fact that eventhe interview happened, it would see the current boss of The Spectatorinterviewing the former editor of the Spectator .The media clearly favoured the status quo at the last independence referendum. Journalism must do better as Scotland enters this new phase of its political le. Thatrsquos the first lesson.Lesson two: Unionism must do better too. Not only will a rehash of Project Fear explode in unionist faces, it will do the public no service. The issues must be intelligently debated not subjected to hyperventilating propaganda.The unionist base must also behave decently this time. At the last referendum, Yes voters were subjected to torrential abuse. Nazi slurs were thrown around with abandon. Ugly demonstrations by hardline loyalists following the referendum result seemed to confirm every Yes voters worst fears about what the No base was really like.In turn, the SNP must reign in its own base. The extremes of the Yes movement are among the most vile in British politics. If itrsquos not taking part in purity purges and circular firing squads, itrsquos perpetuating conspiracy theories and indulging in sustained, organised abuse of those seen as enemies.Now letrsquos turn to the SNP and the Yes movement. For years now, the mantra of another independence referendum has been constant. Yet wersquore moving towards a possible second referendum with little change in the discussion since .Wersquove had some debate on currency. Instead of the  plan to keep the pound, SNP members voted to replace the pound with a new currency as soon as ldquopracticable. Other economic proposals in the Growth Commission may lead Scotland towards more austerity in the event of independence. We need a national ndash not a party ndash discussion on this.Moderate Yes voters, of which Irsquom one, arenrsquot prepared to blunder forward, as part of a nationalist dream, without fine detail and honest answers on the big issues.Will there be a confirmatory referendumScotland votes Yes  No voters cannot be treated as Remain voters were in England. Their cares matter. Independence cannot bring ision and hate. Many undecided voters may also back Yesthey know that a confirmatory referendum will call the whole thing off should negotiations between Edinburgh and London turn into Brexit Mark II.Do we really think a bare win ndash - to Yes ndash is good enough  Isnrsquot that a recipe for national ision and anger  Should the barrier be set higher ndash %  We donrsquot know as we havenrsquot discussed it as a country.How will negotiations with London be undertaken  What about borders  Brexit has shown us that borders are brutal stumbling blocks, killing trade and separating people. Will there be a hard border What about any orce settlement ndash whatrsquos the cost  How will negotiations with the EU for re-entry go  What will be the terms of re-entry What about our defence and security  What will be the composition of our armed forces  Our intelligence services  What about Nato ndash how would it respond to the removal of Trident from Scotland The last time we discussed these issues substantively as a nation was . Times have changed. As long as independence remained on the agenda, the debate should have remained updated. It hasnrsquot. Independence is becoming an empty slogan like Get Brexit Done. It needs to be meaningful. The Yes movement has to offer a refreshed prospectus.Therersquos no fresh start tomorrow ndash just a new chapter. This election has shown us how badly parties and the media have failed. Scotland deserves better as the future looms ndash for that to happen we need informed national debate.This cannot be left to the SNP alone. It is not the domain of that party to forge the future of this country alone. The SNP is entitled to be the political force that sets the path towards independence, given its all but assured electoral dominance, but it cannot be the sole power which refashions Scotland in the st century.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"voters-head-polls-third-general-election-five-years","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who gambled his premiership by triggering the vote, has sought to focus on his pledge to ldquoget Brexit done throughout the campaign.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, his rival in the race to Number , has instead tried to highlight his partyrsquos credentials on the health service and other domestic issues.The polls have narrowed in the final week of what has largely been a tame campaign ndash with few gaffes and many stage-managed visits.On Monday Mr Johnson came under fire for his alleged lack of empathy when he pocketed a journalistrsquos phone when asked to view a photograph of a four-year-old boy who was forced to sleep on a hospital floor.The following day, however, Labourrsquos campaign was rocked when a member of the shadow cabinet was revealed to have poured scorn on Mr Corbynrsquos election chances in a leaked recording.A terror attack on London Bridge ndash which echoed a similar incident in the middle of the  election ndash briefly disrupted the campaign, but quickly turned political as the Tories and Labour exchanged blows over how to deal with such threats.The third General Election in less than five years has been largely dominated by the  vote to leave the European Union ndash with Labour pledging to give voters another say in a second referendum, while the Tories have vowed to take the UK out of the EU next month.A poll by The Dailyand Savanta ComRes, published on Wednesday night, placed the Tories five points ahead of Mr Corbynrsquos party ndash indicating the potential for a Conservative majority or a hung parliament.But a separate poll by Kantar put the Tories on %, Labour on % and the Liberal Democrats on %.Voter turnout, however, could play a major role in the election outcome with rain, wind and chilly temperatures forecast for much of the country throughout Thursday.In a final plea to voters on the eve of polling day, Mr Johnson warned that the election remained on a ldquokne edge, but said it represented a chance to ldquoend the gridlock.ldquoToday is our chance to unite as a country and put the uncertainty to bed so people can get on with their lives, he told supporters in east London.ldquoJust imagine how wonderful it will be to settle down to a turkey dinner this Christmas with Brexit decided ndash and how awful it would beCorbyn and Sturgeon were in Downing Street advancing their plans for two more referendums.ldquoLetrsquos stop the chaos and stop the referendums.

The work is inscribed with the date Victoria made it: October , .: dog-friendly hotels in the North East of ScotlandThere is also a le-size Queen Victoria mannequin in the gothic library and Royal Suites, some with four-posters, and one with a pair of Queen Victorias stockings framed on the wall.In its review of the hotel, the magazine said its brief first impression was that it was an \"art-loving Highland pile with its own stag\".And in a nutshell it said: \"Not so much a hotel as a kind of chemistry experiment, in which art, landscape, history, culture, fine art and a wild, occasionally surreal sense of humour are thrown together, with explosive results.\"Of the things that should change, the magazine said: \"Get rid of the Picasso, the Freud and the Richter and replace them with some nice Jack Vettriano prints.

At his end-of-campaign rally, Mr Johnson noted: ldquoWe all know who would wear the trousers in that relationship.And then, of course, there was the big one: getting Brexit done. The Prime Minister used an array of metaphors to keep it front and centre, including driving a bulldozer through a nine-foot Styrofoam wall marked ldquogridlock.Labourrsquos Christmas box of delights was on an even mightier scale.The renationalisation of public utilities would mean the state becoming much bigger. Big business and the better off were targeted with tax rises to pay for a splurge of an extra poundbn a year on public services.And, of course, given Labourrsquos post-manesto commitment to compensate the so-called Waspi women, borrowing would jump by another poundbn, slapping well over poundbn on the nationrsquos credit card for the parliament.One interesting figure was that for every pound the Tories would spend on public services, Labour would splash out pound.As ever smoke and mirrors were deployed with the Institute for Fiscal Studies ndash lauded by political parties outwith elections but dismissed within them ndash pointing out neither the Tories nor Labour were ldquobeing honest with voters about the tax hikes needed to fund their spending plans.Indeed, honesty was, as ever, another central factor in the campaign.One notable moment came during the BBC Question Time leadersrsquo special when the deeply sceptical audience laughed with derision at some of Mr Johnsonrsquos and Jeremy Corbynrsquos responses.Time and again, the PMrsquos integrity was questioned such as when the father of one of the London Bridge terror attack accused him of seeing only a political opportunity in his sonrsquos death and not simply a tragedy and when the Conservative leader insisted there would be no customs border down the Irish Sea despite official documents saying otherwise.The key moment came when Mr Johnson failed to look at a picture of a four-year-old boy waiting on a hospital floor for treatment and pocketed the reporterrsquos phone. Labour branded him a ldquodisgrace the episode played into its hands not just on the Tory leaderrsquos integrity but also on its key theme of NHS underfunding.But Mr Corbyn did not have it all his own way either on the issue of trust.After being denounced by the Chief Rabbi over his handling of anti-Semitism within Labour, the party leaderrsquos big reveal on how UK-US trade talks meant the NHS was ldquoup for sale was somewhat overshadowed by suggestions Russian hackers had leaked the papers.Then there was Labourrsquos worst own goal with Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, being caught on tape saying Labourrsquos chances of winning were ldquodire and voters ldquocouldnrsquot stand Mr Corbyn.It was noticeable how as each party sought to keep the campaign on its terms ndash the Conservatives on Brexit, Labour on the NHS ndash certain senior figures had been ldquodisappeared. So, no trace of Jacob Rees-Mogg, post his Grenfell gaffe, nor of Labour Remainer Keir Starmer as Labour HQ sought to target Leavers in northern England.While Mr Johnson began the campaign with a poll lead touching  per cent, Tory HQ was always wary of complacency. And rightly so, as the polls began to narrow sharply.The Conservative strategy to protect their leader as much as possible meant he avoided the forensic interrogation.After Mr Corbyn suffered a car-crash interview at the hands of Andrew Neil, Tory HQ clearly decided it was better to take the hit of not facing the Scotrsquos laser beam of enquiry rather than suffer the humiliation of being burnt to shreds on prime time telly.The Tory protect-the-leader strategy even at one point forced Mr Johnson into a fridge to escape the hostile fire of Good Morning Britainrsquos Piers Morgan.As the Liberal Democratsrsquo hubris evaporated, going from forming a majority government to stopping Mr Johnson getting a Commons majority, Jo Swinson perhaps pinpointed the key moment of the entire election when Nigel Farage decided to withdraw Brexit Party candidates from Tory-held seats.Todayrsquos result will prove whether this was the crucial development or whether the great unknown of tactical voting by Leavers and Remainers could decide who gets to enter Downing St."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire council ensures a clear route for voters","story":"Final preparations are being made by Aberdeenshire Council to ensure voters have a clear route as they head for the polls later this week.With the General Election taking place on Thursdaythe Roads, Landscape and Waste Service has been reviewing its winter service arrangements and preparing a contingency plan which can be implemented in the event of severe weather occurring in the days before or during polling day.The service has been working closely with the council’s election team in the preparation of the plan which includes scenario planning for dferent levels of severe weather events, how that might impact on access to polling stations and what resources would be required in order to respond to severe weather.At this time, no specic information has been issued by the Met Office suggesting particularly severe weather, with Wednesday forecast to be largely dry with some light snow on very high ground from noon on Thursday through to midnight.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But to be able to now officially say we have raised over twice the amount we set out to achieve is absolutely amazing. The donations came in thick and fast, and we are so grateful to all of those who contributed in any way. Orkney is a tremendously generous place, and the community has yet again come up trumps!#The rest of the money came in from donations from generous iniduals and businesses across the county, via a the newspaper or through The Orcadian website.“All of the money raised in this campaign will stay in Orkney, and is earmarked for this project, so we will very much look forward to seeing how the CLAN team get on with their plans.“They make such a dference to all of us who have been affected by cancer in any way, by giving advice, a supportive shoulder, support, therapies — even organising a roof over our heads during treatment.“They are truly amazing, and this money will mean that more people can benefit from the fantastic work they do.”#The monies raised, by the people of Orkney and further afield, through The Orcadian’s ‘OutreachCLAN’ appeal, will enable us to reach out to more people across the county who are affected by their own or someone ’s cancer diagnosis, and for that we are truly grateful.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stood as an independent candidate in the  General Election, receiving  votes — despite making previous comments to The Orcadian that the election was #illegal#.But SIC has said that placards erected in Shetland by Mr Hill were #unauthorised#, in that he had not sought prior approval before erecting them.In a press release issued on behalf of the #Sovereign Nation of Shetland#, Mr Hill claimed that the SIC roads department had carried out its #threat# to remove his election signs — which he believes it had no authority to do.He said: “Apparently the left hand doesn#t know what the right hand is doing and neither has the authority to do anything. This is just a strong arm tactic from those who want our message suppressed.#It has long been customary to put up signs on lamp posts at election time and when I was a candidate, no permission was asked and no objections were made. As for not being a candidate – that is nonsense.#I have a message just as valid as any candidate for those wanting to make a legitimate protest vote about the £ million Shetland and Orkney pay to the UK every year for nothing in . Rather than vote in an MP, who can do nothing about it, people should write NO THANX across the ballot paper to keep the power here. All spoiled papers are counted.#The SIC did not have the authority to take down my signs. I will be charging them for doing so. Supporters have rallied round and new ones will be printed and re-erected today. We will not be bullied by those who do not like our message.”Responding to Mr Hill#s comments, a spokeswoman from SIC said:#The road service of the council is in communication with Mr Hill over the matter of unauthorised placards, but we will not publicly comment at this point.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As an obstetrician, I have written often about the priority we should put on the health of our pregnant women and families as they truly hold the future health of the nation in their hands.We are less good at talking about the end of le, dying and the bereavement that follows. Circumstances surrounding a loved one’s death can be remembered by those left behind for the rest of their lives. The impact on families of a ‘bad death’ can be devastating and, of course, there is also an effect on healthcare professionals who deal with death and dying frequently.I remember a weekend working on the maternity unit when I was pregnant with my first child. I met a young woman who was at the same stage as me, but her baby had stopped moving. Initial scans had failed to find a heartbeat. Often this is when I can use my experience to find that elusive heartbeat, but not that day. I had to tell that young couple that their baby, their child, had died – feeling so guilty that mine was still alive. At the end of my sht, I felt exhausted, bereft and deeply sad.: Le expectancy going backwards in ‘many parts’ of Scotland, report finds: Grieving Scottish couple’s stillbirth charity to benefit from Christmas concertIt is often said that time heals but I am not sure about that. I think the passage of time can make it easier to deal with grief, but the pain may never leave us.Conversations are starting around ‘living’ grief and bereavement. As the numbers of people living with dementia increases, the experience of their carers is becoming a focus. They are living with and caring for someone, often a lelong partner, who may no longer care for them or even recognise them.Not a time of joy for allCarers may be isolated, restricted by the frailty and confused behaviour of the person they look after. Comments come from others like “at least they’re still with you”, yet they are grieving for the person they have already lost. For example, “I’m not a widow yet, but I don’t feel married either”, as one lady told me. Carers feel guilty and internalise their own emotions. Together in Dementia Everydayoffers a support network for the carers of those with dementia, allowing those dficult thoughts and feelings to be surfaced.I recently attended an NHS Education for Scotland conference that used the power of patient stories to explore the impact of bereavement on people. The main realisation was that we need to give our staff the permission, time, space, and support to discuss these cases as teams, exploring feelings and emotions, not just clinical facts. It often feels safer to focus on the latter, but the former may prove far more therapeutic. This, of course, can apply to the conversations we also have with patients and families and you can have with your own families at home.Why indeed am I writing an article about death and bereavement, when you perhaps want to read something uplting at this time of year The reality is that Christmas is not a time of joy for everyone – loss can be felt keenly, absence of a family member all the more obvious, a strong sense of missing someone or shared experiences, a trigger for grief suppressed. So at this time of preparation for celebration often with family, take some time to really talk, to acknowledge grief and even the awkwardness about mentioning it. I guarantee both you and the person you are talking to will feel better for it.

This week he gave me detailed instructions for how to spoil his ballot.They can’t be printed in a family newspaper.No one really wanted this election, and the mood throughout has been one of distrust and disappointment. It was called because the politicians couldn’t compromise, so the people had to.: General Election : UK heads to the polls for third election in five years: General Election : These are the key battleground seats in ScotlandThe unpopularity contestProfessor Sir John Curtice dubbed it ‘unpopularity contest’: to lead the country at the most critical time in modern history, the choice was between the least popular new Prime Minister ever, or the least popular leader of the opposition. Uninspiring options yielded only agonising, grudging decisions.When I joined the Tory candidate for Stirling on the doorsteps, I heard voters wrestle with their dilemmas out loud, unprompted. “I wanted to stay in the UK and the EU” “Boris Johnson - what will he do next ” And from someone who voted against Scottish independence: “Why are we Better Together in the UK and not in Europe ”In many parts of Scotland,you supported staying in the UK and the UK staying in the EU, you had to choose which union mattered most. But compromise and disappointment didn’t stop at the border.Brexit Party supporters were told they would trigger a political earthquake across half the country, there wasn’t even a tremor. Nowhere are the stakes higher than in Northern Ireland, but electoral pacts reduced the options for Unionists and Nationalists, Remainers and Leavers alike.: Do I need a polling card or ID to vote in the general election  Can I take photos at the polling station  Voting rules explainedQuestioning old party loyaltiesAnd everywhere, supporters of both the main parties were forced to question political loyalties stretching back generations.For every Corbyn partisan, there was a Labour voter feeling betrayed because their party has ignored them over Europe, or even more painfully, because the stain of anti-semitism has become impossible to conceal or ignore.Equally, Le-long Tories have asked themselves similar questions, wondering whether a party led by Boris Johnson still represents their values.You heard it in the tone of the challenges from audience members at the live TV debates - rare occasions when party leaders face scrutiny from a crowd they haven’t hand-picked.After nine years of austerity and three and a half years on from the EU referendum, the skepticism tipped into cynicism. It’s healthy to laugh at our leaders, but what does it say that the biggest punchline was a Prime Minister saying the truth matters to him To cut through the malaise, both parties tore up their fiscal blueprints and promised more spending than they have in generations. On both sides, the pledges should have been popular: tens of thousands of new nurses and police a publicly-run railway, postal service and utilities.But many simply refused to believe them. It’s not hard to see why when Labour made a £bn promise to compensate women hit by the rising retirement age, the day after their manesto launch, and Johnson floated the scrapping of the TV license - effectively overhauling the funding of the BBC - at a campaign event, conveniently on his most dficult day of the election.Meanwhile, the SNP put forward spending plans that would be undeliverable in an independent Scotland, while the Liberal Democrats overhyped themselves to the point of ridicule.It simply hardened the impression that politicians are willing to say and do anything to get your vote today, but only answer the questions tomorrow.An election of evasionThe -hour news cycle and our always-on social media culture should mean a new age of transparency, scrutiny and accountability. But this election was a pageant of evasion and deception.A Prime Minister who wants to open trade talks with Donald Trump refused to be interviewed for  minutes by Andrew Neil. Both sides played favourites with the questions they took from journalists and the outlets they appeared on. Frontbenchers have haunted spin rooms and trolled from the sidelines.The Conservative Party rebranded its twitter feed ‘FactCheckUK’ during the first debate, and paid to have Google search results for the Labour manesto led by its own attacks - a commentary on its own offering, which abandoned bold promises on tax cuts and social care Johnson made during the Tory leadership campaign.When events broke through the slogans, memes and s**tposts, like the photo of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr sleeping on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary, they were drowned out by a tide of misdirection and misinformation - briefings about punches that were never thrown, and conspiracy theories boosted by columnists and candidates.Most worrying of all, both leaders betrayed a disqualying lack of empathy when it mattered most. Apologies for failures over antisemitism, Islamophobia, and isive past rhetoric had to be dragged out them.Easier to drive a JCB through a polystyrene wall. Somehow, as society grows more aware of the power and nuance of words and deeds, our politics become more macho and unaccountable.New normalFor most of this election, journalists covering the campaign have complained about it being too predictable, almost boring. It’s understandable: we’ve seen the Corbyn Labour playbook before, and Johnson’s message of ‘get Brexit done’ was as strong, stable and inert as two years ago.But we’ve had technology lessons with Jenner Arcuri, the continuing storm over anti-semitism, a terrorist tragedy, secret trade documents and claims of Russian hacking, and a Prime Minister asked how many children he has - a question we still don’t have a definitive answer to.Consider how far the range of what is reasonable has shted: it was news that the President of the United States didn’t make an unprecedented partisan intervention in British domestic politics.Polling dayThis was the first winter election in half a century, and the first December election in a century.Going into polling day, experts said as many as  seats were too close to call. There were former Tory cabinet ministers standing against their party, ex-Prime Ministers telling voters not to back their side, and outgoing Labour MPs endorsing former rivals. This was a remarkable, unique, unrepeatable campaign.If it felt like the most important election in a generation didn’t matter, it’s because a now tired lesson was confirmed: you can’t push a binary constitutional issue through the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy.The machinery is too delicate things break.It can only yield more disappointment. Voters won’t have said no to indyref, and Brexit won’t get done both of the UK’s most isive questions will hang over the country into  and beyond.At least this part was over by Christmas.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg.

You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also.

That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement..."},{"url":null,"title":"car of the week suzuki celerio sx2 ","story":".L Petrol, White, Delivery Mileage or give us a call on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"harbour assistant at shetland island council ","story":"Outline of Duties: Maintain basic harbour log including names of vessels using harbour, date and time of arrival, etc. Inspect harbour structures reporting any defects to the appropriate authorities.

The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#. However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/001WH2911NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 29th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabha puts irish women in the frame","story":"AN intricate painting is proving to be much more than meets the eye in its celebration of Irish women and their place in the world.Entitled Mná hÉireann Women of Ireland, the painting was created by West Belfast artist Meabha Magerr. The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists. I wanted to make this piece more personal.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy.

I spoke about that and other stuff I had seen in the past and also about the present stuff which was ongoing at the time including how I felt personally and what the underlying problems were.“I didn’t know at the time what they were, but speaking to a stranger I opened up and shed many a tear. That was when I noticed the hurt coming out.“As soon as I started to speak about things I would well up and start to cry. I was carrying the hurt for maybe longer than I ever knew.I have never spoken about these things to my family but with Jerry Thompson’s death and how it has affected so many people I thought I should speak up and hopefully my story can bring people in trouble some help and some hope.Aaron Smyth“I was never a confident person growing up and never believed in myself. Even when I won awards during football I still had massive self-doubt.“I was always a bit of a rocket and I won’t ever lose that but now I know I’m in control where before I was reckless and lost.“I had no feelings or emotions and everything was a blur and the world around me was falling down.“Speaking to someone made me see what I was doing and it opened up to me everything I should change. I recognised and realised a lot about myself which I didn’t know and it made me realise the pain I carried was all bottled up and gradually became a bigger problem.“I have never spoken about these things to my family but with Jerry Thompson’s death and how it has affected so many people I thought I should speak up and hopefully my story can bring people in trouble some help and some hope.

She said that, while she didnt feel she had the right to condemn anyone, \" there are people who believe the only way to a united Ireland is through an armed struggle, then fine. Thats not the same as me saying I would be involved in it.\"She added: \"Just because Im a Republican and hold Republican beliefs does not mean I attempted to murder any police officers.\"Mr McCollum asked the defendant is she had \"any problem\" with the attempt to kill police on May , Connor she said she would not condemn \"anyone who continues with the armed struggle, but that does not mean Im involved in that. I support NASA but Im not an astronaut.\"At ious points during her cross-examination, Connor said she had waited for six-and-a-half years to give her version of events. Claiming she could have been set up, Connor was asked about two laptops and a mobile phone found in a mattress in her home.Connor denied owning the devices, pointed out she was not forensically connected to the phone, and suggested the police speak to the person whose fingerprints were located on the mobile.She was also asked to explain the presence of her DNA on a phone located close to the scene of the early morning explosion on the Crumlin Road and gloves found in an alleyway, as well as her blood on a hoodie top found in a nearby skip.Connor said that, prior to the events of May , she had \"contributed items of clothing to ious republicans groups\", such as hats and gloves.She added: \"There are many, many many potentially innocent ways to explain what there was DNA belonging to me on those gloves.\"When asked about her blood on the hoodie, she raised concerns about the accuracy of the forensic results as the hoodie was in a skip with other items.Again suggesting she had been set up by someone , Connor said: \"Im only speculating, but perhaps when I was wearing it maybe ten years ago, perhaps we had a car crash together and perhaps I got blood on him.\"Connor was also asked to comment on two video clips - one was a short movie clip of the inside of Connors home which is accompanied by a female voice, while the second is a longer clip of a woman walking in north Belfast.Its the Crowns case that the latter is Connor recording a practice route for the first pipe bomb incident on May .

Reminding her that she swore on the Bible to tell the truth, the prosecuting QC said: \"You have no compunction about telling lies to get yourself out of the mess you have got yourself into.\"She replied: \"I totally disagree with that. I fully accepted coming into court that no matter what I say or no matter what I do, I will automatically be deemed the bad one.\"Im a Republican. Lets be honest here, born bad, born guilty.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

There had been a view in some quarters that the public meetings organised by a section of loyalism would probably run out of steam.They didnt. Indeed, they seem to have energised a younger generation of loyalism which has, up until now, tended to keep its head down and do most of its activism on social media. The target of their anger is Boris Johnsons Betrayal Act, so it will be interesting to see what will happenhe manages to win a comfortable majority and pushes ahead with his deal.While it is true that a result which curtails Johnsons room for manoeuvre would dissipate some of the anger, it is also true that, having been harnessed and galvanised, it is hard to see this new movementjust disappearing.The reaction of this movement could prove crucial when the new talks begin.. Boris Johnson only made one trip to Northern Ireland during the entire campaign and used it to produce waterfalls of waffle about what was, or wasnt, included in his withdrawal agreement.He hadnt a clue. Im not even sure he could have pointed to the Irish Sea on a map, let alone known where Northern Ireland ended and the Republic began.Bizarrely, he didnt seem to have the slightest concern about trumpeting his ignorance, even when he was having a meeting with local Conservative members. Okay, he knows that the four candidates being fielded by his party wouldnt be getting enough votes between them to fill a smallish hall in the middle of nowhere, but you would have thought that he could, at the very least, have been honest with them. But no, not a bit of it. He continued to waffle. Maybe he just cant help himself.He had already proved that he wasnt listening to the views of the DUP, so why would he even begin to care what anyone  he met during the visit was thinking . Every campaign produces a story which is remembered long after the election is over. This particular one isnt as historically signicant as the Relief of Mafeking or the Relief of Derry. That said, the Relief of Finucane was splashed across the front of the Belfastand followed up by a number of other media outlets. It gave rise to a stream of jokes, most of them involving number ones, number twos, iations of flushing away support, inconvenient truths and his determination to meet the challenge from the DU Pee.My own favourite was that he hadnt really done anything wrong because the General Election is based on a \"first p****d the post\" form of voting.If nothing , we can always rely on our much celebrated sense of humour to see us through."},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 decision day as key northern ireland constituencies hang in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Asked whether a Boris Brexit might be al for the Irish unity project, O’Neill insisted that running Northern Ireland into the ground was not the way forward for unity — which wiped out a few decades of recent republican history. Naomi Long also rejected the inevitability thesis.Colum Eastwood drew applause by attacking Sinn Fein for being absent from Westminster yet trousering millions in expenses. O’Neill responded sharply, by claiming the SDLP leader was “disingenuous”, highlighting SNP impotence in London. Special status for the North — which a Boris Brexit represented — was a product of Sinn Fein activism beyond Westminster, she claimed.

need of fundamental reform and preferably replacement.Direct Provision was set up in  in response to an increase in the number of people seeking asylum in Ireland.Speaking at launch of Justice Committee report on Direct Provision, Sinn Féin TD Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin says the committee believes the system of shared institutionalised living is failing to fully respect the rights to privacy and human dignity of those placed in DP centres. pic kKzuRlKu— Áine McMahonDecember , It has been criticised by migrant rights groups due to theof time people wait for their asylum applications or appeals to be processed and the impact this has on children.The report on Direct Provision and the International Protection Application process makes  recommendations in total.Launching the report, Sinn Fein TD Caoimhghin O Caolain, the committee’s chairman, said an expert review of the Direct Provision system is required as it is “not fit for purpose”.The report highlights the impact it has on children in the system, challenges people face in accessing the labour market and the “inadequate” support and services being offered to vulnerable people.The committee calls for a move towards providing own door accommodation that offers a mix of “independent and supported living to cater for the needs of all applicants”.It also suggests an expert group is established to conduct a comparative analysis of best practices in other jurisdictions that may be adapted for implementation in Ireland.The report also states there should be a move away from a reliance on commercial running of Direct Provision services and that approved housing bodies should be involved instead.It suggests the nine-month waiting time for asylum seekers to access to the labour market should be reduced or removed.Children were devastated because they would not be in school to see their friendsSinn Fein TD Caoimhghin O CaolainLaunching the report on Thursday, Mr O Caolain said the committee believes the system of shared institutionalised living is “failing to fully respect the right to privacy and human dignity of those living in the centres”.He recalled visiting a Direct Provision centre in Co Monaghan, where children said they were upset about the school summer holidays as they faced months of being in their DP centre with nothing to do.“These children were devastated because they would not be in school to see their friends and and it meant they were going from a day filled with activity and distractions to one where there was limited prospects,” he said.He said in some cases, people living in Direct Provision centres are “treated like cattle”.The report found Direct Provision has a negative influence on the “mental health and well-being of all person who are housed for long periods of time”.It noted concern over a lack of support for vulnerable residents – including those who experienced abuse or were trafficked.The report said the practice of housing asylum seekers in emergency accommodation must end.Since September , asylum seekers have been placed in hotels and BBs due to pressure on the existing  Direct Provision centres.“The committee is very aware of the current wider housing crisis in Ireland, nevertheless, the use of emergency accommodation must cease as soon as possible,” the report said.It also states an increasing number of people with positive decisions are remaining in Direct Provision centres as no other accommodation is available or affordable to them.Mr O Caolain acknowledged while the time for the current Government is running out, he hopes the next administration will implement the recommendations in the report as asylum seekers will continue to come to the Ireland and a better system is needed."},{"url":null,"title":"exit polls suggest good

The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy.

Beijing has threatened to retaliatethe new tarfs go into effect.Uncertainty over trade has been the biggest wildcard for stocks this year. The long-standing conflict has hurt manufacturing around the world and caused US businesses to hold back on making investments. The saving grace for the economy has been a strong job market and consumer spending.Speculation that the world’s two biggest economies could be close to reaching an interim “Phase ” trade agreement spurred investors on Thursday to move money into technology, industrial and other stock sectors that tend to do well when the economy is growing.“If we get a China trade deal, it’s probably going to catalyse another -plus months of growth in the US and globally,” Mr Phillips said.Banks helped lead the gains as bond prices fell, sending yields higher. Bank of America rose .%. Higher yields allow banks to charge more lucrative interest rates on mortgages and other loans.The yield on the -year Treasury jumped to .% from .% late on Wednesday. That is an unusually large increase and signals more confidence in economic growth.Technology companies also made strong gains.

The agreement, which would be limited to , dollars per person, would require court approval that is unlikely to come before spring.The Weinstein Co is currently proceeding in bankruptcy court, where any deal would face review.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Harvey Weinstein leaves court following a hearing on Wednesday The discussion of the deal revealed by lawyers a day earlier arose during a hearing in Manhattan pertaining to a lawsuit filed against the company and the disgraced movie mogul by former Weinstein consultant Alexandra Canosa.Ms Canosa, who has not joined the proposed settlement, has alleged that Weinstein on multiple occasions from  to  raped, sexually abused, intimidated and harassed her during what he maintained were business meetings in New York, Los Angeles, Malaysia and Budapest.Scores of women have accused the movie mogul of sexual misconduct. He has denied non-consensual sex allegations. He faces a January  trial on rape and sexual assault charges in state court, where he has pleaded not guilty.Judge Engelmayer agreed that depositions needed before a trial in Ms Canosa’s case against Weinstein could wait to be taken until several weeks after his criminal trial ends. The testimony would include questioning of Ms Canosa and Weinstein by lawyers in the case as they prepare to present evidence to a jury.Ms Canosa’s lawyer, Thomas Giuffra, said outside court that the vast majority of women who have sued Weinstein were agreeing to settle because their cases were weakened by allegations so long ago that the statute of limitations would apply.“They’re getting a half-million for an out-of-statute case,” he said.He said Ms Canosa was determined to fight on. At least two other women were doing the same, he added.“They assumed we would just go along with the herd,” he said of other lawyers. “She’s the most courageous client I’ve ever had.”"},{"url":null,"title":"500689","story":"The Creggan Community Collective has organised a pre-Christmas cultural event that will be taking place this week.Based at An Cro Mor, Creggan Community Collective has liaised with Valued Voices to arrange an evening of stories, poems, music, song and craic for Wednesday th December at pm.This free event will bring together Creggan writers Ben Dillon, Liam Diver, Caitlin Browne performing alongside poet, playwright and filmmaker, Damian Gorman, currently in the city working with the Playhouse.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Barker, who previously held the post of Vice Chairman, takes over from the outgoing Brian Smith who served his five years in the chair. Former Chairman John Keenan was also nominated for ato hot-seat but opted not to let his name go forward. Keenan addressed the floor, explaining that, while he was honoured to have been asked to lead the county again, he endorsed Barker as a suitable candidate. In his address, Barker thanked his club Moneymore for his grounding in administration, where he became Secretary at the age of  and after five years he had a similar stint as Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “I am looking forward to taking Derry in a new direction in ,” he said. He told club delegates in attendance that he wished for his tenure not to be about me but about the county. Barker confirmed that he has already set the wheels in motion for an in-depth review of Derry GAA, under the guidance of high ranking Ulster GAA Official and former Ballinderry Chairman Stephen McGeehan. It is based around – as Barker outlined - where the currently sits, where it needs to go and how it will get here. The findings of the review are due to be fed back early in . googletag.cmd.push With Barker moving up the ladder, former All-Ireland winning defender Kieran McKeever was elected unopposed as Vice Chairman. McKeever was last year tasked by the now defunct Advisory Committee to brainstorm ideas at a well-attended meeting of football people on the direction they feel the county needed to take. The Dungiven man is the first of four new faces now in office. At last years AGM, no Treasurer was elected and when Michael Hasson was co-opted at a later stage, he stood down before the end of his tenure. Liam Peoples, who previously held the post, was nominated this year but didnt stand. There was a vote between the other two candidates with Ogra Colmcilles Martin Devlin elected ahead of Limavady man Mark Gannon. Patsy Mullan didnt wish to seek re-election as Coaching Officer. Karl Diamond was nominated but didnt stand. Hugh McGrath and Bobby Farren, who stood against Brian Smith for the chair last year, were the other nominations. Foreglen delegate Noel McFeely asked the floorMcGraths position as Logistics Manager with the county teams was a conflict of interests. In a show of hands, called by Brian Smith who oversaw the election of officers, both names were put forward with Farren winning by one vote, -. Outgoing PRO Conor Nicholl didnt seek aand Lissans Ciaran McRory was elected, as was Paul Birt to the new post of Assistant Treasurer. RECOMMENDATIONS Following the election of officers, the proposed motions recommendations were discussed. However, with a query raised from the floor that none of the listed suggestions from clubs had been cross-referenced with the GAAs Official Guide, they could only be put forward as recommendations. Ballinderry were calling for adult club players be guaranteed a minimum of two championship games in the year. Pat McGuckin spoke on the issue citing the level of preparation that goes in at club level and that players deserve the same chances as inter-county players. Newbridge delegate Seamus McNeill also touched on the issue but suggested that until the CCCC in Croke Park give clubs a better window for championship games, there was very little counties could do. Stephen Barker, who also sits on the fixtures taskforce in Croke Park, highlighted that there are moves to condense the inter-county season further. In terms of the club championships, Barker stated that the CCC are pondering over three options – a championship based on groups, ato the backdoor model and retaining the knock-out format. Loup called for senior leagues to be revert to  teams. Games Administrator Breige ONeill pointed out that unless clubs were prepared to play without county players, then the situation was unlikely to change. While Barker stressed that league sizes would remain, the CCC are exploring a system that will give players more league games. The possibility of a split after  rounds, with the top and bottom half splitting off - a system currently implemented in Antrim. It would give an additional five matches to decide relegation, promotion and league titles. Slaughtneil outlined a recommendation for the club championships, football and hurling, to be played in over a  week period, with a game every three weeks to allow dual clubs adequate time for structured training. With winners needed for the Ulster competitions in October, this format would require the championship to roll out in mid-July. New Slaughtneil Chairman Sean McGuigan, stated that he was happy to wait on the outcome of the CCCs proposals. FINANCE Earlier in the meeting, a financial report - audited by ASM Chartered Accountants - was delivered by Central Council Delegate Danny Scullion, as a result of no official treasurer being appointed after Michael Hasson stepped down during the year. The report outlined an operating surplus of pound, for the year and in his address, outgoing Chairman Brian Smith referenced unnecessary speculation that the county were in financial dficulties. The gate receipts for  totaled pound,, a figure that increased almost pound, from the previous year. Another signicant change related to team expenses. The total came to pound, with and increase of just over pound, since . Within the breakdown, there was an increase of pound, for teams administration expenses from . In explanation of the increase, Danny Scullion highlighted that two members of the senior hurling management team are travelling from Dublin and there was an increase in number on football management teams. With the costs involved, Scullion stated that the situation needs monitored in future. It is predicted that the loan currently taken out to the cover the cost of development at Owenbeg is due to be paid off by next summer.

Barker, who previously held the post of Vice Chairman, takes over from the outgoing Brian Smith who served his five years in the chair. Former Chairman John Keenan was also nominated for ato hot-seat but opted not to let his name go forward. Keenan addressed the floor, explaining that, while he was honoured to have been asked to lead the county again, he endorsed Barker as a suitable candidate. In his address, Barker thanked his club Moneymore for his grounding in administration, where he became Secretary at the age of  and after five years he had a similar stint as Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “I am looking forward to taking Derry in a new direction in ,” he said. He told club delegates in attendance that he wished for his tenure not to be about me but about the county. Barker confirmed that he has already set the wheels in motion for an in-depth review of Derry GAA, under the guidance of high ranking Ulster GAA Official and former Ballinderry Chairman Stephen McGeehan. It is based around – as Barker outlined - where the currently sits, where it needs to go and how it will get here. The findings of the review are due to be fed back early in . googletag.cmd.push With Barker moving up the ladder, former All-Ireland winning defender Kieran McKeever was elected unopposed as Vice Chairman. McKeever was last year tasked by the now defunct Advisory Committee to brainstorm ideas at a well-attended meeting of football people on the direction they feel the county needed to take. The Dungiven man is the first of four new faces now in office. At last years AGM, no Treasurer was elected and when Michael Hasson was co-opted at a later stage, he stood down before the end of his tenure. Liam Peoples, who previously held the post, was nominated this year but didnt stand. There was a vote between the other two candidates with Ogra Colmcilles Martin Devlin elected ahead of Limavady man Mark Gannon. Patsy Mullan didnt wish to seek re-election as Coaching Officer. Karl Diamond was nominated but didnt stand. Hugh McGrath and Bobby Farren, who stood against Brian Smith for the chair last year, were the other nominations. Foreglen delegate Noel McFeely asked the floorMcGraths position as Logistics Manager with the county teams was a conflict of interests. In a show of hands, called by Brian Smith who oversaw the election of officers, both names were put forward with Farren winning by one vote, -. Outgoing PRO Conor Nicholl didnt seek aand Lissans Ciaran McRory was elected, as was Paul Birt to the new post of Assistant Treasurer. RECOMMENDATIONS Following the election of officers, the proposed motions recommendations were discussed. However, with a query raised from the floor that none of the listed suggestions from clubs had been cross-referenced with the GAAs Official Guide, they could only be put forward as recommendations. Ballinderry were calling for adult club players be guaranteed a minimum of two championship games in the year. Pat McGuckin spoke on the issue citing the level of preparation that goes in at club level and that players deserve the same chances as inter-county players. Newbridge delegate Seamus McNeill also touched on the issue but suggested that until the CCCC in Croke Park give clubs a better window for championship games, there was very little counties could do. Stephen Barker, who also sits on the fixtures taskforce in Croke Park, highlighted that there are moves to condense the inter-county season further. In terms of the club championships, Barker stated that the CCC are pondering over three options – a championship based on groups, ato the backdoor model and retaining the knock-out format. Loup called for senior leagues to be revert to  teams. Games Administrator Breige ONeill pointed out that unless clubs were prepared to play without county players, then the situation was unlikely to change. While Barker stressed that league sizes would remain, the CCC are exploring a system that will give players more league games. The possibility of a split after  rounds, with the top and bottom half splitting off - a system currently implemented in Antrim. It would give an additional five matches to decide relegation, promotion and league titles. Slaughtneil outlined a recommendation for the club championships, football and hurling, to be played in over a  week period, with a game every three weeks to allow dual clubs adequate time for structured training. With winners needed for the Ulster competitions in October, this format would require the championship to roll out in mid-July. New Slaughtneil Chairman Sean McGuigan, stated that he was happy to wait on the outcome of the CCCs proposals. FINANCE Earlier in the meeting, a financial report - audited by ASM Chartered Accountants - was delivered by Central Council Delegate Danny Scullion, as a result of no official treasurer being appointed after Michael Hasson stepped down during the year. The report outlined an operating surplus of pound, for the year and in his address, outgoing Chairman Brian Smith referenced unnecessary speculation that the county were in financial dficulties. The gate receipts for  totaled pound,, a figure that increased almost pound, from the previous year. Another signicant change related to team expenses. The total came to pound, with and increase of just over pound, since . Within the breakdown, there was an increase of pound, for teams administration expenses from . In explanation of the increase, Danny Scullion highlighted that two members of the senior hurling management team are travelling from Dublin and there was an increase in number on football management teams. With the costs involved, Scullion stated that the situation needs monitored in future. It is predicted that the loan currently taken out to the cover the cost of development at Owenbeg is due to be paid off by next summer.

I am looking forward to getting started and engaging with the membership on a range of dferent issues.“I am under no illusions as to the challenge which lies before us going into . While a no-deal Brexit was avoided at the end of October, next week’s General Election will likely decide the fate of Brexit in the short- and medium-term. Our geographical location means access to markets in Great Britain, Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU must remain open and unfettered. It is crucial that our members can trade on the same terms as before.”“On behalf of the Chamber, I want to thank Brian for his dedication and commitment. Brian has done a fantastic job of representing our membership and their interests over the last year.”“I am excited to continue to showcase the huge potential of the North West to the rest of the UK, Ireland and Europe, and I will be working closely with our members over the next year to ensure we can fulfil our potential.”Outgoing President, Brian McGrath said: “The past  months have been an immense personal and professional privilege. In my role as President, I have engaged with business leaders, politicians from across the UK, Republic of Ireland, Europe, China and the US to ensure the voice of our membership has been heard loud and clear.”“We’ve seen new record levels of tourists coming to visit, our retail businesses are going from strength to strength, and the announcement of a City Deal package in May has the potential to act as a catalyst to attract new and important investment into the region.”“ will present signicant challenges for the North West business community but I am confident that Redmond and Dawn will show strong and dynamic leadership, represent the interests and views of our membership, and succeed in carrying on our hard work this year.

The scheme is subject to an Economic Appraisal and the outcome of a funding application with the Department for Communities . If funding is confirmed, the project will move to planning application stage with further public consultations, followed by procurement. The anticipated start date of any scheme is early . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

in Capitol Hill, the Daacuteil, Brussels and Downing Street.“We’re on the EU side of the negotiating table and with our MEPs, MPs, TDs, MLAs we’ve certainly made a dference.“Sinn Feacutein has also delivered for East Derry.“We have led the way by decentralizing the DAERA headquarters to Ballykelly and bringing high quality public sector jobs to the north west.“As Minister for Infrastructure, Chris Hazzard delivered the A and the Dungiven bypass after decades of waiting.“Sinn Feacutein education ministers invested in the schools estate across the constituency and we have also delivered on community and sports facilities. “Sinn Feacutein is committed to delivering on investment and jobs across the constituency and improving the infrastructure including roads and broadband. “Sinn Feacutein is also committed to protecting our environment and natural heritage, and to effectively tackling the Climate Emergency through urgent and concerted action.“Sinn Feacutein remains fully invested and committed to the Good Friday Agreement.“The current political impasse is unsustainable and unacceptable and Sinn Feacutein stands ready to form a credible executive.“We want to see a new Assembly and a new kind of politics in the New year is what we’re working towards.“We want an Executive which is to be credible, delivering on issues such as public sector pay, safe staffing levels in the health service, investment in our schools, economic policies that deliver prosperity for all and that invests in rural communities, and a mitigation package that protects people from Tory welfare reform.“This is the election of a generation because what the people decide now will shape the direction of our politics, economy and future for years to come.“Discussion about our constitutional future is clearly on the agenda.“It is now a question of when notthe referendum on Irish unity will be held.“In April , the EU made a declaration which says that in the event of a successful referendum on Irish unity, the North would automatically come back into the EU with the rest of Ireland.“Irish unity is a means to enjoy many more benefits than what the union with Britain has on offer.“A stark choice is opening up between the narrow, inward-looking vision of Brexit Britain and the open inclusive vision of a New Ireland.“We’re without doubt entering a decade of opportunity where the freedom to choose our own future will be decided by all of the people on this island alone.“The opportunity now exists over this new decade to bring people together.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He also encouraged congregations to show the love of Christ by offering a lt to those who might find it dficult getting to their polling station.In his letter, the Moderator acknowledged the fact that Northern Ireland goes to the polls for the third time in a year, and this will be the third General Election being fought since . Dr Henry said that, ‘unlike most elections when the polls open in sunlight and close before twilight comes, in this first December election in nearly a century, they will open in darkness and close in darkness.”Dr Henry said that the timing of the election provided, “additional opportunities to demonstrate in both a practical and personal way the love of Christ through offering a lt to those who may have dficulty in getting out to vote, or may be a little apprehensive about venturing to the polling station in the cold or the dark.”For younger members of congregations he said that it “may be an exciting time as they participate in their first General Election. However, given the ongoing stagnation in Northern Ireland’s political situation, or the stalemate over Brexit at Westminster, which precipitated this very election, and other seasonal reasons, some may feel a little reluctant to go out and vote.“Even so, may I encourage you and your congregation to approach this General Election prayerfully and go out and vote in the hope that those we elect will work with a commitment to the common good and with generosity of spirit towards one another Dr Henry concluded his letter by saying, “As my predecessors have reminded us in the run up to other elections, engaging and participating in the democratic process is one of the ways that we may seek ‘the peace and prosperity of the city’ to which we have been called . At the same time please remember to pray for those in political authority, and for those who seek it.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I started out doing  metres on the treadmill and I’m up to three quarters of a mile now, I’m doing well on the bike too and I’ve lost a stone in weight.“It gives me a great sense of purpose to get out of the house and come here to do my training.“The road to recovery is a long one and I would like to thank every nurse, doctor and physio who has worked with me to get me to this point and all the staff in the Foyle Arena, they have all been a brilliant help.”George’s coach at the Foyle Arena, Rosie O’Brien said he was the perfect candidate for the programme.“The Steps To Health programme aims to improve physical, social and mental health wellbeing,” she said.“Barriers for George would be his balance but he’s doing really well and uses most of the inclusive equipment in the gym that is adaptable for all users.“He has shown great determination to improve his fitness levels and he has benefitted from the social aspect of coming into the Foyle Arena and mixing with other gym members and staff.”For full details of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Leisure Facilities visit derrystrabane leisure. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I started out doing  metres on the treadmill and I’m up to three quarters of a mile now, I’m doing well on the bike too and I’ve lost a stone in weight.“It gives me a great sense of purpose to get out of the house and come here to do my training.“The road to recovery is a long one and I would like to thank every nurse, doctor and physio who has worked with me to get me to this point and all the staff in the Foyle Arena, they have all been a brilliant help.”George’s coach at the Foyle Arena, Rosie O’Brien said he was the perfect candidate for the programme.“The Steps To Health programme aims to improve physical, social and mental health wellbeing,” she said.“Barriers for George would be his balance but he’s doing really well and uses most of the inclusive equipment in the gym that is adaptable for all users.“He has shown great determination to improve his fitness levels and he has benefitted from the social aspect of coming into the Foyle Arena and mixing with other gym members and staff.”For full details of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Leisure Facilities visit derrystrabane leisure. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But with play-off hopes still very much an ambition this season, there is a positive ion the fact that the league positions are so condensed this year. Despite that defeat, there are still only four places between ninth place and third place, which is currently occupied by Omagh and victory over Midleton this week could leave Derry in a much healthier position leading into the Christmas break. That much is certain, but what isnt certain is what kind of performance City of Derry will produce, with the nature of the defeat to Enniscorthy surprising after their morale-boosting win at Bangor a week earlier. Decision making and ball possession were key issues where Derry let themselves down and coach Richard McCarter is hoping that lessons can be learned from the most recent defeat.“For a large part of the game we werent at the races and then two intercepts at the end made it look worse,” he admitted.“Its all really congested this year. Its tight so we just have to play well in these games andyou play well you have a good chance. It depends how clinical you are as well and against Enniscorthy we didnt do either so thats what happens.”McCarter and OKane had targeted three wins ahead of the Christmas break and whilst they got off to the perfect start at Bangor, those plans were ended by last Saturdays display which saw Derry fall behind early on and never recover.“We thought we could win that game and we thought we could win all three, especially because it was at home,” he continued. “Even at the end we thought we could have gotten something out of the game and thats why we were chasing, but well move onto the next game. It puts a bit of pressure on us now because it is a must win but again its onewe play well, then we will win butwe dont, we wont.”This weeks opponents Midleton sit bottom of the league table and a win for them would take them right back into the mix with seven other teams in the ision. That is the incentive for the hosts this weekend, but McCarter is determined that City of Derry ficus on their own jobs and finish a mixed year on a high to give the,m plenty of reason to be optimistic heading into .“We want to be in the top half of the picture,” he stated. “It just sets the tone over Christmas becauseyou win it it just leaves everybody feeling really positive looking into the New Year andwe dont then it will have the opposite effect obviously. We havent turned into a bad team overnight and well certainly be going down there this weekend hoping to show that. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes across the Province, with the remainder of the cash expected to come from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.At this weekrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency and other key players..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements.

Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
