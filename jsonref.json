For this reason, Prince Harry’s takeover of the National Geographic Instagram account to encourage people to “look up” and get lost in the beauty of trees is a weirdly enticing concept.On Monday, the Duke of Sussex curated a set of images of forest canopies each taken by National Geographic photographers, which went out to the publication’s 123 million followers. The idea was to highlight the importance of conservation while spotlighting the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy campaign, which will result in two national parks being created in South Africa, where Harry is touring. As part of the campaign, 50 countries have either dedicated indigenous forest for conservation or committed to planting millions of new trees to combat climate change.One image shows Harry flat on his backside, taking a photo of an imposing South African baobab tree, which can live for more than 1,000 years and, due to its size, even sustain its own ecosystem. The Duke has captured its spindly branches with a finesse rewarded by 412,000 likes. The other photographs, which include a red-leafed autumnal British tree and the distinctive strangler fig, with its branches knotted together like a spider’s web, are strikingly beautiful. It is a shame, though, that the accompanying captions – in which Harry describes how the strangler fig’s twisty barks helped it earn its name or why the red leaves of autumn in the UK are special – are so alarmingly redolent of a basic Wikipedia search.A few more details on why these trees are so ecologically important might have been a good idea. Fortunately, the National Geographic’s enthusiastic readers don’t seem to mind: one of the top-rated comments is from rappers Cypress Hill, whose use of the tree emoji may allude to sparking up debate about a very different kind of plant.Thanks to its snappy hashtag (#LookingUp) and hundreds of thousands of likes, the campaign will at least encourage Instagram users to find out more about the potential of planting trees. New research predicts that a worldwide planting programme could have a “mind-blowing” effect by removing as many as two-thirds of all the emissions that humans currently pump into the atmosphere. It argues that with 1.7bn hectares of treeless land available, which is roughly the same size as the US and China combined, around 1.2tn native tree saplings could be naturally grown. Suddenly, Harry liking trees seems kind of cool.Critics will surely point to the hypocrisy of Harry fronting an eco-friendly campaign while riding around in a private jet. Nonetheless, in encouraging the public to regard trees as holy beings, rather than disposable wood, his takeover of the National Geographic’s Instagram spotlights the important role these natural giants can play in preserving the future of our planet.Prince Charles, infamously once revealed how he likes to talk to his plants, but Harry’s fascination with trees appears less like a midlife crisis and more like a savvy social media-friendly way to address global warming. After weeks of unflattering headlines about his and Meghan’s travelling habits, Harry’s tree-hugging won’t do much to get them back on side, but in terms of positioning the Duke of Sussex as, well, the Green Prince, it looks like mission accomplished."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73ec5f20437703b702764aed602e0a0ebf4c8222/0_504_2046_1227/master/2046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52506e18d3b450e48418818b5029c8df","title":"rembrandt light game of thrones dulwich picture gallery","story":"Dulwich Picture Gallery, LondonIn imagining the artist as a cinematographer, this exhibition misses the bigger picture – and in any case, his love of murk would make him a terrible filmmakerIf Rembrandt were alive today, claims Dulwich Picture Gallery, he’d be a cinematographer. It’s a very precise posthumous career choice. Why not a director, special effects wizard, installation artist … or even painter? But this inventive exhibition, which marks the 350th anniversary of Rembrandt’s death, is certain he’d be photographing films. It has even brought in Peter Suschitzky, cinematographer of The Empire Strikes Back, to help craft the show in a way that brings out the great artist’s genius for telling stories with light.I can’t help thinking that, as a cinematographer, Rembrandt would annoy audiences hugely. When the Game of Thrones makers dared to light a nocturnal battle scene as it might look in a world without electric light, many viewers expressed outrage. I liked it, not least because it was reminiscent of Rembrandt – you won’t find a more mysterious night than the one that engulfs the people hunched around a campfire in his wonderful Landscape With the Rest on the Flight into Egypt. What would those complainants make of a scene in which a maester sat reading in an inky-black room, as a philosopher does here? Or an elderly couple all but disappearing in the gloom of a chamber, lit just by a dwindling fire? These are typical of the extreme lighting effects that Rembrandt uses in this exhibition, in sublime paintings and prints lent from such great collections as the Louvre and Rijksmuseum.This is a show to delight art snobs with loans of the sheer quality of the Queen’s Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb – except that it wants to be popular, and accessible, and to do so will kick Rembrandt blinking into the age of blockbuster film. Every exhibit has a screenplay-style caption that treats paintings as movie scenes. “INT. TEMPLE – DAY,” says the text for The Woman Taken in Adultery, lent by the National Gallery in London. “A WOMAN crouches on shallow stone steps in a pool of cold light, surrounded by a group of men. A PHARISEE lifts her veil … CHRIST listens.”It’s a nice gag, but it is done for every single picture in a way that verges on the obsessive. At the end of the exhibition, the wheeze climaxes in film-style credits for everyone involved. I half expected a post-credit joke in which the aged Rembrandt is slumping along a street in 17th-century Amsterdam when Captain America materialises to take him to paint a deathbed portrait of Iron Man.Rembrandt needs no movie references. What does it mean to present him as a kind of film-maker, telling stories in light? It is true as far as it goes, but inadequate. With Rembrandt, any such partial view misses the big picture of a truly universal artist. The exhibition ends with a selection of portraits including Dulwich’s own harrowingly dark-eyed melancholy youth, which may well be a picture of Rembrandt’s son Titus before he died at the age of 26. Nearby is Self-Portrait in a Flat Cap, from the Royal Collection. From 1642, the year he painted The Night Watch, Rembrandt depicts himself in black velvety headgear and a gold earring which displays his success. Then your gaze is grabbed by his lucid, all-seeing orbs which measure you up with that commanding mixture of judgment and compassion and you feel the full sense of inexplicable awe.At least Dulwich didn’t take a lead from that flat cap to compare Rembrandt with Peaky Blinders. With loans of this calibre by one of the greatest artists ever to hold a maulstick you can’t go wrong – but they have a damn good try. All we need is to have the paintings clearly lit and a chance to look at them in our own way. That is lost in at least one part of the show where I watched Suschitzky finalise a lighting scheme for Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb. The audience sit on a bench to watch as we begin in darkness, then light gradually increases on the painting in a dawn effect. It holds at full lighting for a minute or so before plunging into gloom to restart the sequence. You’re supposed to listen to an audioguide for the accompanying soundtrack. But what if I don’t want an audioguide? And what if I want to look closely at the furrows and crinkles of Rembrandt’s paint? I’ll get asked by other visitors to move because I’m spoiling the film.That’s what the exhibition achieves: it replaces the self-directed effort of engaging with painting with the much more passive and remote experience of watching a film or video art. Ultimately, to claim that Rembrandt is a cinematographer and give his paintings arty mood-lighting is to try and reduce his genius to our own slipshod standards. Walter Benjamin once said that every document of civilisation was also a document of barbarism. Well, every celebration of past genius is also a reckoning with the dead. How do we measure up to Rembrandt’s light?Not very well, if we can’t tell the difference between what movies and television do and what Rembrandt did. It is precisely because he is more challenging and more satisfying than the visual clutter that surrounds us that we come back to him year after year and century after century. At its core, this exhibition does not seem to grasp the true uniqueness of Rembrandt. That’s a bad look in any light."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03fac67cbb24fb331aea79de32a5bc481da1a5b7/0_212_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ff95ff90457c28c0dc783b2fdce1065","title":"va to close raphael cartoons gallery for major revamp","story":"Project planned for 2020 will show Renaissance treasures in unprecedented detailOne of the UK’s most dramatic gallery spaces, which displays the Raphael Cartoons, is to close temporarily to allow the first major refurbishment in more than 25 years.On Tuesday the Victoria and Albert Museum in London announced details of a project planned for most of 2020 which it said would allow visitors to see artworks which are considered among the greatest treasures of the Renaissance in more detail than ever before.The cartoons are designs commissioned in 1515 by Pope Leo X for a series of tapestries in the Sistine Chapel illustrating the lives of St Peter and St Paul. Seven of 10 survive and were brought to Britain in the 17th century by the Prince of Wales, later Charles I.They remained in the royal collection until Queen Victoria loaned them to the South Kensington Museum in 1865 in memory of Prince Albert. They have remained stars of the museum, now the V\u0026ampA, ever since.The gallery where they hang was originally designed for the museum’s Indian art collection. In 1950 the cartoons were transferred there and it has proved “the perfect space” said Ana Debenedetti, the lead curator of the Raphael Project.“It has almost the same dimensions as the Sistine Chapel, only 2 sq metres of difference. It is a dramatic gallery which allows a meditative feeling and this is really what we want to enhance.”The Raphael Court was last refurbished between 1992-96 and a refresh was due, given that the natural lifecycle of such spaces is 25 years.The fact that 2020 is the the 500th anniversary of Raphael’s death gave an added impetus.Debenedetti said the new gallery would have state-of-the art lighting and a darker colour on the walls to help focus visitors’ eyes on the cartoons’ vibrant palette. There will also be enhanced interpretation including high-definition, infrared and 3D scans of the cartoons.Because the cartoons cannot be moved the work will go on around them from 27 January, with the hope of being completed by October. That would coincide with a major show planned by the National Gallery to open on 3 October.Debenedetti said the seven cartoons, each measuring 5 metres wide and 3.5 metres high, were “a unique Renaissance treasure, both in terms of aesthetic value and technical achievement”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3392cdf83cdceacba8d22d87f1fd5fa6963ab4b/0_72_1348_808/master/1348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de02aaa2def53de6549aaf8c4605b277","title":"the fantasy figures of txema yeste in pictures","story":"Born in Spain, Yeste began his career working for newspapers.

But an export bar was placed on it by the government in the hope a UK buyer would match the price to keep in the country.Byrne’s copy has been described as “the last surviving contemporary ‘witness’” to the 1960 trial of Penguin Books, which was a test case for the Obscene Publications Act. The jury took three hours to return a not guilty verdict for Penguin, with Lady Chatterley’s Lover going on to sell 2m copies in just two years.After a crowdfunding appeal from English Pen raised more than £20,000, and Penguin Books and the TS Eliot estate donated a combined £15,000, the University of Bristol has stepped forward to acquire the book. It is “proactively seeking financial support from alumni and friends of the university to reach the rest of the total purchase price”, and will house the book in its collections as part of the Penguin Archive.“This special book will be a source of inspiration, teaching and research for our staff, students and visitors, supporting the university’s creative, scholarly and social outcomes for years to come,” said deputy vice-chancellor, professor Judith Squires. “It will be a focal point in our new university library, which is planned to open in 202324, providing specialist research facilities, galleries and public event spaces.”English Pen president Philippe Sands said the free speech organisation was thrilled that the campaign had been successful. “The trial involving Lady Chatterley’s Lover was a seminal moment in the continuing struggle for freedom of expression, and the judge’s copy belongs here in the UK, a singular reminder of the road travelled and remaining.” Gaiman, who was born the day after Lady Chatterley was made legal, said it was important that the book stayed in the UK. “That a crowd of people came together to contribute is proof that the internet is actually good for something,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db8d568c066fa1ca369e785cce860a0c63cc0788/0_264_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89369ba48068b7658eb51c8ccc68f1d9","title":"greggs to stockpile bacon and tuna to avert brexit shortages","story":"Bakery chain also switches to buying cheese in UK and has leased extra warehouse spaceGreggs is preparing to stockpile bacon and tuna and has switched to buying all its cheese in the UK as the bakery chain tries to avert shortages in the event of a chaotic Brexit.Roger Whiteside, the chief executive of Britain’s largest bakery chain, said the company had leased extra warehouse space and this month would begin building additional stocks of ingredients vulnerable to hold-ups at the UK’s ports.Whiteside said sales growth was likely to slow against strong trading in the previous financial year, when Greggs benefited from new breakfast ranges and the introduction of its vegan sausage roll in January 2019.

We don’t have long-life items in the way that others do,” he said.Greggs has examined all its recipes and looked at how it might replace delicate ingredients such as lettuce and tomatoes, which are largely imported from Spain over the winter, in the event of any disruption to supply.The company has also begun sourcing all its cheese and most of its sugar in the UK, shifting away from European suppliers, to avoid disruption related to Brexit.The purchase of some delivery lorries has also been brought forward to avoid any potential problems with shipping the vehicles from Europe after the Brexit deadline of 31 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f605a870f421396b2ef4ab441a21bed3e61bd5f/74_0_4759_2856/master/4759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56227363e8dcfc286c50ef257897e361","title":"ryanair boss says the package holiday market is finished","story":"Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has criticised Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority for awarding Thomas Cook a licence just months before its collapse and said the package holiday market was finished.Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel firm, collapsed last week, leaving more than 150,000 UK holidaymakers stranded abroad. O’Leary praised the CAA for its Operation Matterhorn rescue airline set up to bring back stranded passengers, but said it needed to do more to prevent airline failures in the first place.Speaking at a Reuters Newsmakers event, O’Leary added: “The CAA should be much more aggressive in requiring the shareholders of those companies to put up much more cash to get through the year, rather than allowing them to continually fail.”The CAA granted Thomas Cook its airline operating certificate in April while its Atol licence, which guarantees repatriation and refunds for holidaymakers if their tour operator goes bust, was due for renewal this month. Thomas Cook’s airline was profitable and had been put up for sale in February. However, a buyer could not be found.Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair’s chief marketing officer, said at a separate press briefing that Ryanair was lobbying the CAA to introduce more robust, quarterly stress tests for airlines and tour operators, and to force “financially weak” firms to set aside money to cover the repatriation of passengers should the companies go bust.Brexit“There is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,” said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.\u0026nbspWeatherThe summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the “lates” market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.CompetitionA pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.\u0026nbspBanks and debtThe tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a\u0026nbsp huge pile of debt for the past decade – £1.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.\u0026nbspBad managementThomas Cook’s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter.O’Leary was blunt about the the package holiday market, saying it was “screwed, it’s over”.According to the travel industry group Abta , half of UK holidaymakers took a package holiday last year, a figure that has held steady since 2014. Thomas Cook’s rival Tui has fared better, with strong demand for for holiday experiences. It also owns many of its hotels.Ryanair, Europe’s biggest carrier expects passenger numbers to stay flat at 46.3m in the UK next year, despite a likely boost from former Thomas Cook customers. It launched 14 new routes including flights from London Stansted to Terceira in the Azores and Manchester to Pisa.Ryanair still plans to shut some lossmaking bases, and warned some pilots would lose their jobs, as it has 500 more than it needs. Jacobs said the number of redundancies would be lower than that as pilots who quit will not be replaced and others are being offered unpaid leave.O’Leary dismissed criticism of the €100m (£89m) bonus the airline could hand him over five years, saying it was an “easy target” for the mediaand they should focus on Premier League footballers’ pay instead.He said Ryanair would wait for “the next turn in the cycle” before ordering more Boeing or Airbus jets at cheaper prices.The Irish carrier is one of the biggest customers of Boeing’s grounded 737 Max aircraft, with 135 firm aircraft orders and 75 options, and O’Leary said the company could add Airbus jets to its fleet in the medium term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c6140f8396864116a704aced984339d16beead/0_9_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6e1e2a4e09dc6104acad7d583368572","title":"uk house pricesno deal brexit nationwide london","story":"House prices in Britain unexpectedly fell last month amid mounting fears over the impact of no-deal Brexit on the property market.With just 30 days until Britain’s scheduled departure date from the EU with little sign of a breakthrough in the deadlock with Brussels, analysts said property buyers and sellers were delaying their decisions amid the uncertainty.Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: “With the economy largely struggling and the outlook highly uncertain, we suspect that house prices will remain soft in the near term at least.”Analysts said continued uncertainty over Brexit would continue to weigh on house price growth across the country. Prices also remain unaffordable for many younger buyers after rising significantly over the past decade at a time of stalling wage rises.Sam Mitchell, the chief executive of online estate agent Housesimple, said: “It’s hard to say what the next month will have in store.

You can’t succumb to despair every time the prime minister lies or the leader of the House of Commons makes a debasing remark about parliament, there simply isn’t time. I find it quite surprising, now, to feel depressed by the Today programme.And yet on Monday the Saj did reawaken that political nerve, on a tour of the broadcast studios to preview his unmemorable conference speech. “Everyone on the doorstep,” the chancellor proclaimed, “is saying, ‘get Brexit done’. They don’t say, ‘cancel the result’. They don’t say, ‘have a second referendum’. They say, ‘get Brexit done’.” As a matter of observable fact, this can’t be right: what about the 6 million who signed the petition to revoke article 50? Or the 16 million-plus who voted remain? Or the young voters who came of age after 2016? And on and on. Sajid Javid would have been safer sticking to the formula deployed by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly. He told an audience in Manchester this week that he had been “knocking on very traditional Victorian terraced houses” in Darlington, where he met a guy who said: “You’re that Tory. I’m going to vote for you lot.” It might not get past a creative writing tutor, but at least it’s not immediately falsifiable.Of course, the chancellor didn’t literally mean “everyone on the doorstep”. He was using a new parlance, in which “everyone” doesn’t mean “all the citizens” but “all the authentic citizens”. How can you tell which citizens are the authentic ones? They’re the ones who agree with the proposition that we must Get Brexit Done.At root, this is an old political trick – nicely described by the cultural theorist Stuart Hall in 2012: “Politicians always think they know what people feel. It’s a fallacy, because there is no such thing as ‘the people’. It is a discursive device for summoning the people that you want. You’re constructing the people, you’re not reflecting the people.”Our current politics deploys that technique on ketamine: slower, dumber, more intense. It is now considered reasonable to stand up and say: “I’ve met all the real people, and they all agree with me.” The habit has spread from politicians to commentators, so it’s not unusual to see 20-something rightwing thinktankers on TV current affairs programmes confidently telling everyone what “the people” want – to which one is tempted to reply, “mate, which people? Who have you even met, ever, in your whole life?” Which of course misses the point. It’s a construction, not a reflection.But where once, as Hall notes, it constructed a shared view of “common sense”, now its purpose is the obliteration of reasonable difference or dissent. If you don’t adhere to the view that “the people” are said to hold – no matter how extreme – you’re not merely wrong. You are simply not real.The invocation of this all-powerful imaginary “people” has put predictable pressure on those opinion canvassers of the media who think of themselves as neutral – the BBC and other broadcasters, with their ever-more controversial vox pops. There are, it transpires, some surprisingly radical views in the nation at large: among the eyebrow-raisers have been the man who told the BBC in January that it will be character building for us to run short of food, and the guy who signalled his willingness to pay even with his own life for a no-deal Brexit, should it cause him to run short of the medication he needs.Setting aside the questionable significance of these inidual views, there are endless methodological questions around the sampling of “random” vox pops. The notion – presented with a straight face by a BBC news presenter in Stoke last week – that a few people you corral at midday in a shopping centre represent “a cross-section of voters” is obviously absurd.Fundamentally, though, the spectre of what any given group ought to think haunts the reporters. When they’re in a “leave area” and someone gives the “wrong” answer – suggesting, for instance, that Boris Johnson should resign – they are no longer representative of the area, and the reporter has to set off in search of another person who can say the right thing for “balance”.There is no such thing as a neutral survey in the world of the vox pop: the TV camera brings an invitation to strike a pose, but it also reflects the expectation of the person behind the camera from the exchange and the thousand subtle ways in which they convey it. I was always struck, when I went on reporting trips to a town at the same time as other journalists, how we would all come back with a different man-on-the-street. One would always meet the people who felt displaced by immigrants another would unfailingly meet the one who hated Jeremy Corbyn and I would come back with a weird story about someone’s daughter-in-law who was obsessed with colouring-in books, and it would turn out she had an anxiety disorder, and then it would transpire that she was on a zero-hours contract.The point is not that they were biased and I was neutral and this paper is better than all the others: it’s interesting precisely because we unintentionally and in good faith dig for the stories we’re interested in. It is, in the end, not an encounter between a scientist and a specimen – but two people trying to connect. What is produced is always idiosyncratic, and only revealing insofar as you’re prepared to consider what it reveals about both sides of the encounter.This isn’t to say that interviewing people is corrupted simply because the interviewers are human too. What’s problematic is the politically expedient contention that there are opinions that are held by all members of a demographic group – from northerners, women, millennials, pensioners, all the way up to “the people”. When we recognise that as a fallacy, we might finally be able to hear one another."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05160bcc989f986e2990ea4d17496b1675450bd/0_105_4084_2450/master/4084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=232829f6ae624063bd30345b02ec81fc","title":"traitors remoaners civil servant brexit language","story":"There is a clear link between the provocative language used by ministers and other politicians and the increase of threats to public figures. Everyone knows it, which is why politicians of every stripe have asked urgent questions in parliament that all focused on Boris Johnson’s use of inflammatory language as a deliberate strategy. Instead of answering them, junior minister Kevin Foster shrugged off the concerns, and relentlessly bridged back to what has become the Tory party conference motto: “get Brexit done”.Only after that, we are told, will the hate and the ision in our country subside, as if an election and a promised spending splurge could repair the damage that’s been done to our public square over three years.Civil servants don’t believe a word of it. A nasty, no-deal Brexit followed by an even nastier “people v parliament” election campaign will further imperil not just our public figures but our institutions too, with dire consequences for public services over the coming months.I see three main threats. First, Dominic Cummings. Remember what first triggered alarms about his appointment? He is a self-confessed shock doctor whose goals reach beyond Brexit and the winning of the next general election. Brexit’s dark lord has longer-term plans to change the whole way the business of government is delivered. The last few weeks of havoc provide us with ample evidence to suppose that his best hope for doing that starts with a disorientated, destabilised civil service.What’s the matter with these civil servants? Don’t they believe in Brexit? If they do, they shouldn’t. They are professionals whose task is to carry out government policies through plans built on logic and evidence, not Orwellian doublethink. But there is cause for concern: I recently came across a job description for a senior no-deal planning role in a Brexit-facing department – it told applicants that essential attributes were an “ability to handle complexity and ambiguity”. I’m the first to recognise that Operation Yellowhammer has actually done a lot to put in place plans for no-deal Brexit mitigation, even if it’s clear that they won’t be nearly enough. But more recent plans are disintegrating before our eyes.For example, assurances from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, about the flow of medicines were only last week contradicted by the National Audit Office. The ink was barely dry on Johnson’s press release about his £3bn investment in 40 hospitals before health experts found serious holes in the proposals. And Department for Education ministers are facing questions  over the very existence of its no-deal Brexit planning. Most of all, the government still refuses to be honest about the true cost of a no-deal Brexit.That’s why we need Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and the head of the civil service to mitigate the worst of the damage while he still can. He’s the government’s most senior non-political adviser and oversees, among other things, the ministerial code that governs the conduct of cabinet ministers, and the prime minister himself. He also may be the person who ends up asking the EU for a Brexit extension.Mark is a busy man. Just in the last couple of weeks, he has been asked to investigate the prime minister’s alleged sexual misconduct, as well as the claims that the Johnson’s backers will benefit from a no-deal Brexit.He is currently on a “listening tour”, according to his leaked letter to senior civil servants, which may explain why he’s been a bit quiet lately. But, whether in private or public, we need Mark to quickly take action – he alone has the mandate to ensure the civil service is in one piece for whatever happens after 31 October. He can’t have missed Nigel Farage’s appalling exclamation about taking a knife to “non-neutral civil servants”. Like all civil servants, Mark’s job is not to be neutral, it is to be truthful.In the meantime, civil servants like me have to stay anonymous – we can’t go on the Today programme to explain how a no-deal Brexit is going to be hard enough without worrying about how the courts, a future Brexit inquiry or angry hi-vis mobs will come after us. We aren’t traitors or remoaners – we just want to get on with our jobs.• The civil servant works in a Whitehall department and was part of Operation Yellowhammer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58118c51853673ed6cf8f8e89c5b6b5df8718041/486_0_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5531b09b21bfdd2317ab711f9efdff56","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of brave","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘brave’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘brave’.Share your photos of what brave means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 October at 10am.

If so, Canada has it covered … Thanks to its combination of natural beauty and a widely varied landscape, Canada lends itself to a vast range of outdoor pursuits. As the world’s second-largest country and ning 10 provinces and three territories, it really does have something for everyone.Explore the lakes of OntarioPerfect for: unwinding in the sunWhen the Canadian summer hits, Ontario cottage country is the place to be. Think lazy days gazing out at picture-perfect views, jumping off docks into the cool waters of crystal-clear lakes, boat cruises, kayaking, barbecues out on the deck, and above all, unwinding to the point of total relaxation. Among the many canoeing opportunities, paddling a voyager canoe on the Mattawa River stands out. Pretend you’re a fur trader by joining guides in a 30-foot craft, with the option to visit Talon Chute waterfall. Visiting Ontario is an experience you’ll want to return to again and again. With a wide choice of resorts available, you can ensure a unique stay every time, too.Mountain bike in Whistler, British ColumbiaPerfect for: thrill-seekersThe Whistler Blackcomb resort may be known as one of North America’s top skiing destinations, but when spring arrives and the snow melts, it transforms into something else: a playground for downhill mountain biking. Whistler Mountain Bike Park is accessible from Whistler Village by chairlift from mid-May to mid-October, and although the network of trails – ning 50 miles and 1,500 vertical metres (4,900 feet) – may seem daunting, the technical, tighter runs are balanced with smoother toboggan-like beginner zones, meaning you don’t have to be a pro to take on this adrenaline kick of an experience. It’s best to experience the trails yourself in June and September. When you’ve had your fill of two wheels, then enjoy a glass of wine in one of Canada’s largest wine regions.Celebrate Canada Day in Ottawa, OntarioPerfect for: fans of live musicWhere better to celebrate Canada Day than the country’s capital, Ottawa? Settle in at various spots around the city – Confederation Boulevard, Major’s Hill Park or the Ottawa River – and enjoy a full line-up of entertainment, including an air show courtesy of the Canadian armed forces, musical performances from the likes of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, followed by a fireworks display that’s sure to inspire Canadian pride, no matter where you’re from. There’s also free entry to national museums and art galleries.Try out cowboy skills on a ranch in AlbertaPerfect for: learning new skillsAlberta may be known for its iconic national parks (Banff has to be seen to be believed), but south of Banff has just as much to offer, in the form of cowboy country. With rolling foothills, vast cattle grounds, and sunsets that’ll stop you in your tracks, experience the cowboy lifestyle at one of the numerous working and guest ranches in the region. Saddle up for some cattle driving, help with daily chores, try your hand at horseshoe tossing, or opt for one of the more hotel-like guest ranches, with experiences such as horseback camping trips or even spa services on offer. Either way, you’re guaranteed a warm welcome, a break from the fast-pace of modern life, and an unforgettable stay. There are even half-day horse rides if you’re worried about being saddle sore.Go on a polar bear safari in Manitoba (and see the northern lights)Perfect for: adventurous animal-loversForget the Big Five – you’re in Canada now, and safari means one thing: polar bears. To see them in the wild you’ll need to head to Churchill, Manitoba – a region perfectly placed for spotting the iconic (and endangered) white bears in their natural environment, as they wait on the shore for the Hudson Bay freeze before heading out to hunt for seals. Several tour operators offer excursions in adapted vehicles out into the Arctic tundra, with one-day trips or longer expeditions available. It’s not just polar bears that make this a once-in-a-lifetime trip either, because Churchill is also one of the best places in the world to see the northern lights. A two-for-one deal, if you will.Spend a night at the Hotel de Glace in QuebecPerfect for: stepping out of your comfort zoneDrive a few hours out of the historic Quebec city and you’ll find a hotel that’s a little on the chilly side of things. Why? Because it’s made out of ice. You’ll need to time your stay within a very specific window though: Hôtel de Glace is constructed in January and melts away in March each year. Because, you know, ice. With 44 rooms, a chapel, ice bar and even slides, this construction is a work of art and engineering as well as a place to rest your head (day visitors also welcome). Don’t worry about freezing in your sleep either – while the various sofas, chairs and tables are carved out of ice, beds feature soft (and warm!) mattresses, with duvets to boot.Catch and eat lobster in Atlantic CanadaPerfect for: foodiesWhen it comes to Nova Scotia, it doesn’t get more authentic than heading out into the waters of the North Atlantic with an experienced fisherman to catch your own lobster, before enjoying an on-board seafood boil. If fishing isn’t your thing, you can still enjoy the rewards without the work – especially if you’re planning to visit in February, which sees Nova Scotia’s South Shore Lobster Crawl festival take place along the shore each year. A lobster-lover’s dream, it includes an abundance of events, including the best lobster roll challenge. Yum.Visit Iceberg Alley on the Newfoundland coastPerfect for: lovers of the natural worldFerryland, an hour south of St John’s, Newfoundland, made headlines in 2017 thanks to a rather unique neighbour, in the form of a giant iceberg. The town is located right on a part of Canada’s east coast known as Iceberg Alley, so-called because hundreds of icebergs that break off in the Arctic float down past the Newfoundland and Labrador from spring to September. And while the behemoth that took up residence on Ferryland’s doorstep was a particularly large example, you can spot these 10,000-year-old glacial giants from many viewing points along the northern and eastern coasts of this province, by boat tour or kayak. You can even track them online.Walk on the ocean floor in the Bay of FundyPerfect for: intrepid explorersFancy going for a walk? How about a stroll along the actual ocean floor? It may sound out-of-this-world, but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible – because in the Bay of Fundy, which lies between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, you can do just that. It’s all thanks to the unusual variance between low and high tide in the bay, which can exceed 15 metres. At low tide, the ocean floor at the head of the bay is exposed for around three hours, with towering cliffs and sea stacks creating a surreal backdrop to seafloor exploration – which often yields the discovery of fossils, sea glass, and semi-precious stones. Then visit a few hours later to see how fast the water returns.Fly WestJet from London to Canada’s capital cities and have your own Canadian adventure"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbe692aacaa6cff92b06975d8f44d560be532d79/0_172_5733_3442/master/5733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d481d47ee6dcfdee6a003a012274eb","title":"great for the grid canadas most instagrammable views","story":"Whether it’s Québec City’s gorgeous Rue du Cul-de-Sac, whale watching off the coast of British Columbia or taking in the vast northern expanse of Baffin Island, Canada is full of incomparable photo-opsNo matter if you’re armed with a DSLR or just a trusty iPhone, start planning your trip with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42d8a78f536e6d3a8047271114fce8278e6552d/19_0_6680_4010/master/6680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b36bbc6db7b5bed78c4a0fafa2c8cab","title":"canadas 10 coolest neighbourhoods in pictures","story":"Canada has a lot more to offer than just breathtaking natural scenery – and there is plenty of that – its thriving cities also happen to be home to some of the hippest, most dynamic neighbourhoods in North America.

Local authorities would carry out regular “health checks” instead, while inspectors would be called in for more in-depth visits. What do teachers and parents think? Should Ofsted be abolished?maths teacher, the Beacon school, Banstead, SurreyYes. Ofsted creates an environment of fear, anxiety and worry for teachers. To prepare for an Ofsted visit, you may have to do a lot of tick-box exercises, regimented things that don’t add value but help a school to look good. It inevitably adds to a teacher’s workload.Plus the current system is so punitive. There’s no supportive element to it. An external body comes in and passes judgment on a school. A bad judgment can feel like a prison sentence, involving years of seriously irrelevant work and pressure from headteachers. That has a negative effect on classroom teachers and, inevitably, students.Schools should be held accountable but they should be supported as well as evaluated, ideally by other school leaders with local expertise, as part of a continuous improvement process. Context matters and, unlike Ofsted inspectors, local teachers will understand the school’s demographic and its history over the years.Schools should be told: these are your strengths, these are your weaknesses and these are some brilliant schools in your geographical area, we’re going to support you to work together collaboratively.I would not shy away from someone coming in regularly to tell me how I can improve. I’m a professional, I want to do my job better. But I want someone who’s going to put an arm around me and walk on that journey with me, someone who will support me, not just tell me all the things I’m not doing right.consultant and former headteacher, who resigned on TV in the BBC documentary SchoolNo, because accountability is important – and we could spend a lot of unnecessary time restructuring the accountability system in line with what Labour is saying. However, there is too much human interpretation in the inspection framework and I don’t think it should continue in its current format. What needs to change is Ofsted’s job, so inspectors are no longer trying to root out under-performance, inadequacy and failure.Ofsted needs to be a lot more realistic about what it can accurately, effectively and specifically hold schools accountable for. I don’t think it’s feasible or possible to inspect everything a school does accurately, and then reduce it down to a one-word judgment.So I agree with Labour: we should either remove the judgment categories or stop trying to summarise the work that schools do with one word that is then used as a stick to beat schools with.We’d be better off if Ofsted judged schools annually on outcomes it is accurately able to quantify. The focus of the inspections, however, should be detached from the dataset and identify where practice is good and needs to improve. The inspection would then take on a completely different flavour, and use a broad body of research, evidence and training to support schools and help them improve.Yes. I chose to send my child to a school that had just been told by Ofsted it “requires improvement”. Although I thought the judgment was absolutely right, I saw at close-hand the effect it had. The school lost a lot of pupils, it lost money and had to get rid of experienced staff, which meant it was harder for it to improve.In other countries you don’t have this totally punitive system. Teachers don’t need to be whipped into doing their jobs better. I think teachers genuinely want to provide the best quality education. It’s crucial to have inspections, but one- or two-day inspections are too short – you can’t get under the skin of the school. Nor can you accurately sum up a school with a one-word judgment. We need a way of assessing schools that results in a much more positive relationship and takes into account the wellbeing of students and staff and how inclusive the school is. At the moment, some schools discourage admission of children with additional needs because it affects their results.Support for school improvement has to be at a local level and come from experts who know the particular challenges of the schools in their area. I agree it would be good to have the option of more formal and less formal inspections by inspectors who are independent of the local authority – but those inspectors should have a constructive mindset. I’d like to see a network of successful former headteachers visiting schools regularly and providing ideas and connections. We need, as Angela Rayner says, a much more collaborative model of education, rather than pitting schools against each other.Yes, but only if something better can replace it. I’m not sure whether Ofsted can be successfully overhauled, and every educational institution has to be accountable for its standards. I also think the safeguarding of children should be checked every year.What Ofsted does at the moment isn’t necessarily bad practice but it’s not contextualised. I’d like to see local audits every year by a former teacher or teaching specialist who understands the local area. They should take into account whether the school is surrounded by grammar schools or in an area of huge social deprivation, and consider whether the local authority is effective and if the level of funding is appropriate for that school.I’d love to get rid of judgments, as Labour proposes. At the moment, the process doesn’t feel very human. A one-word judgment is too simplistic, because even schools in special measures have fantastic stuff going on.But I’d worry about Labour’s proposal to give more control to local authorities. If you’ve got a really strong local authority, that’s fine. But in some areas, schools can be left to rot.I’d like to see schools have more of a say in who comes to see them. There are some absolutely cracking inspectors out there and I wouldn’t want to stop them doing their job. When they turn up and support you, and provide really useful feedback, it’s magic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7680b312250f1e788f8834b1c78ab644c3b4ca95/0_329_5804_3482/master/5804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a3125860b7c6c0037c81140654788f6","title":"oxford professors children refused visas to join her in uk","story":"US family split as Home Office makes it increasingly difficult for overseas academics to work in UK universitiesAmber Murrey, an American academic, was “ecstatic” about being appointed associate professor in geography at Oxford University last year. But the dream turned sour two weeks ago when the Home Office refused to grant visas for her two daughters, aged four and nine, to live with her in the UK.Dr Murrey used an immigration lawyer to make sure the visa applications for her daughters, who have US passports, went smoothly, and was not anticipating a problem. Her husband has business commitments overseeing property renovations in Cameroon, where he is from, and the couple had included joint written consent for their daughters to live with her in Oxford.“When I read those three unemotional sentences saying they were denying my children entry to the UK I felt complete disbelief,” she says. “I had already packed the girls’ bags and bought their school uniforms. It is insane that you can have a legal document with both parents’ consent to have the children with their mother and they simply say no, that can’t happen.”Her case will add to a tide of anger among academics, who say the Home Office’s hostile immigration environment is making it difficult for talented people from abroad to forge an academic career in the UK.This is the second time in a month that the Home Office has refused a visa to an American academic based at Oxford University. Last month Education  reported that Dr Elizabeth Ford, a music historian about to start a fellowship at Oxford, was given two weeks to leave after eight years in the UK, because the Home Office said it had granted her last visa erroneously.Young overseas academics say that universities are now so frightened of the tough new visa regime that, in some cases, they are automatically rejecting international candidates for jobs they should be eligible for.Dr Murrey, an expert on social change in Africa, who has published widely and previously held positions at universities in Cairo, Massachusetts and Ethiopia, took up her post in Oxford last year. Without proof of residency she couldn’t set up schooling or somewhere to live in advance, so the couple decided she should establish a base in Oxford before moving the family. While she has been returning to Cameroon to see her daughters and husband in the university holidays, she says this has been an emotional strain.“It has been really hard, because I need to spend more time with my daughters but I am wary of being out of the UK for too long in case it jeopardises the terms of my tier 2 visa,” she says.The news has hit the family hard. Murrey says: “My nine-year-old had been so excited about her new school, and our apartment near a meadow. After I told her their visas had been denied she told me: ‘I know why they rejected me, it’s because I’ve been misbehaving this week, Mama’. We both cried very hard.”The Home Office rejection letters say that under immigration rules a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living together in the UK. This would be waived if the parent living here had sole responsibility for the children, or the other partner had died.“This policy seems to operate under the guise of keeping families together, but it is splitting mine apart,” Murrey says.Ultimately the couple want the whole family to live together in Oxford, but Murrey says that right now they are just trying to “do what is best for our daughters”.She doesn’t know whether she has been singled out as a risk because her husband is from Cameroon. “We have family members and friends there who have been rejected for British visas in the past,” she says.The Wellcome Trust, a health research charity, has evidence of around 100 cases in which academics, especially from African countries, have been refused visas to come to the UK for conferences, often for spurious reasons.The African Studies Association UK found that at least 17 delegates were refused entry for its biennial academic conference at Birmingham University last year.Insa Nolte, a lecturer in African culture at Birmingham, is frustrated that academics can’t appeal against these decisions. “There is no process to identify immigration officers who consistently misjudge cases or who make racist assumptions,” she says.“If we are going to find solutions to global concerns like food security and climate change, we need to collaborate with academics across the world.”Meanwhile, young international academics who have gained their PhDs in Britain say some universities, fearful of the tougher visa rules, are automatically rejecting non-UK nationals for jobs for which they should be eligible.Dr Lisa Kalayji, an American who did her PhD in sociology at Edinburgh University, says: “In one case it was a job at another university I knew I could get a visa for. There was a pop-up as soon as I clicked the box saying I would need a visa. It said: ‘It is extremely unlikely that we would be able to sponsor you and we recommend that you abandon the application now’.” She applied anyway, but at 1am the next day received a rejection email. “It was clear that was an automated response, presumably because I was not a UK national.” Kalayji has given up applying to British universities. “Living with the hostile environment in the UK has worn me down so much that I don’t want to be an immigrant any more. The emotional tax is too great. I’m going home.”A young Canadian academic, who wished to remain anonymous, recently encountered a similar pop-up window when applying for a full-time lectureship that should have qualified her for a tier 2 visa at a London university.“It said: ‘It is highly unlikely that you would obtain permission to work in the UK on the basis of an offer for this … job. It is therefore recommended that you do not continue with your application’.”She says this felt like a sign saying: “foreigners go home”. She blames the government rather than universities, but says that after a year of applying for jobs she is beginning to feel desperate.Gareth Edwards, a senior geography lecturer at the University of East Anglia and co-founder of International and Broke, which campaigns against high visa costs for academics, says international academics are getting this sort of pop-up warning when applying for permanent lectureships. “Those jobs are most certainly eligible for sponsorship,” he says.Melany Cruz, a Chilean PhD student at Birmingham University, applied for an academic position elsewhere and also got an apparently automated rejection at 1am the next working day. “I’m sure not many HR people are working at 1am. I don’t think my application ever made it to the panel,” she says. “It is starting to feel impossible to find a job as an international PhD student, which is such a shame as I love what I do.”Paul Boustead, chair of the HR practitioners’ group Universities Human Resources, says universities want to recruit the most talented staff but some roles are simply “unlikely to obtain a work permit”.The Home Office says:“We welcome international academics from across the globe and recognise their contribution to the UK’s world-leading education sector. All UK visa applications are considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence available, and in line with the immigration rules.”This story was amended on 1 October 2019 to correct the spelling of Lisa Kalayji’s name.

The guy I play, Travis Stubbs, works in an office cubicle in the early 90s. He is stuck in a job he hates and not happy about where he is in life, but he has aspirations. He wants to look like a successful businessman but he doesn’t have much style or taste. Bad style in the early 90s gives you a plethora of horrible, horrible outfits. It was one of my favourite characters to create in terms of the look and the hair. It’s always fun when you create a character who looks different from the way they feel. He has bought into a pyramid scheme, so in order to recruit more people he wants to look important and successful. We had a lot of fun putting together some ostentatious and quite tacky outfits, culminating in a very ill-fitting tuxedo.Going to costume fittings is always instrumental, for me, in finding the character. I spend hours thinking: “What kind of shoe would this guy wear? What kind of jacket?” It’s always a collaboration between me and the costume designer and I will agonise over an outfit – if I find a great pair of shoes, but they are slightly the wrong colour, that can bother me a lot.In my personal life, I don’t pay much attention to what I wear – it’s the other end of the spectrum and I like to just switch off. I don’t have the energy to spend more than two minutes thinking about it in the morning and so I pretty much wear the same thing every day. That is not to say I’m not interested in clothes – it can be fun to dress up for an event – but that’s a special occasion. I never “put together an outfit” if I’m just running around New York or Stockholm. I have always been allergic to clothes that are not comfortable – as much as I love the look of a wool sweater, I can’t wear them because they’re too itchy.

In the tunnel, there was Roy Keane telling Patrick Vieira he’d see him out there. By the touchline there was Gary Neville kicking José Antonio Reyes. Just outside the penalty area, there was Martin Keown jostling Ruud van Nistelrooy. Remember? Remember how every man knew when we reached out to claim the throne? Remember when we were kings?Those pre-Abramovich days when this was the biggest game in English football seem a long time ago now, two decades gone with atrocious haste. Manchester United and Arsenal aren’t even the best sides in their respective cities any more and on nights like Monday it was impossible not to wonder how long it will take them to get back to where they were, whether they ever will get back.There are two great lies in football. The first, the short-term one, is transition. It’s an excuse made easier by the impatience of so much of football’s culture. Any manager can brush off a defeat or a run of poor form by saying his side is in transition. When the sack comes they can claim they just needed more time. Sometimes it is true. Among the most vivid of all the memories that haunt Old Trafford is the reaction to the 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace in December 1989. The bedsheet bemoaning “three years of excuses” may be the most famous manifestation of the discontent but the fans en masse were in uproar.Six months later, United won the FA Cup and 23 years of success under Alex Ferguson had begun.It’s easy now to wonder what might have happened had the board not held its nerve, had Mark Robins not scored that winner at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup. If memories of that season and an instance when the transition was demonstrably in the right direction incline fans to caution now it is understandable. But often transition is just another word for stagnation.That season 30 years ago feels particularly relevant now. This is the fewest points United have had after seven games of a league season since then. Such judgments are subjective, but this feels the weakest squad United have had since then, certainly relative to the rest of the league. It’s not necessarily straightforward to tell in the moment but back then there was a clear plan as Ferguson refashioned and professionalised the squad. Can anybody, looking at this squad, at the recent transfers in and out, honestly say they can see a clear policy?Does anybody have any faith, even if fortunes are splurged, that things will be better in two transfer widows? In four? In six?Football’s other great lie is that success is cyclical, as though if you’re big enough things will come good if you wait long enough.Squads have cycles, it’s true, and whoever is in charge of long-term development, be that a manager or a sporting director, must manage the age profile of a team while fighting a constant war with entropy – but those are the details. There is also a macro picture and it’s that that must be of serious concern for United.Manchester United have made their worst start to a Premier League season after Monday night\u0027s 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford.Pressure points: The pressure has built on Ole Gunnar Solskjær as United have taken only nine points from their first seven games – just enough for them to squeak in to the top half of the table. United have won only once since their opening 4-0 victory over Chelsea, with Marcus Rashford\u0027s penalty earning them a 1-0 home win against Leicester.\u0026nbspFall from grace:\u0026nbspIt is just two years since José Mourinho oversaw United\u0027s joint-best start to a Premier League season. United claimed 19 points from their first seven games in 2017-18, equalling the starts made by Sir Alex Ferguson\u0027s sides in 1999-2000 and 2011-12. United finished runners-up under Mourinho that season, but a whopping 19 points adrift of champions Manchester City.\u0026nbspOle at the wheel: The figures make bleak reading for Solskjær when comparing the Norwegian\u0027s record with his predecessors. Mourinho – who would be sacked in December – made a poor start last season, but his 10-point haul from the first seven games was still one more than Solskjær has managed 12 months on. David Moyes also took 10 points from his first seven games in the 2013-14 season, while Louis van Gaal won 11 and 16 points in the respective 2014-15 and 2015-16 campaigns.\u0026nbsp30-year low: The last time United made such a poor start to a campaign was under Ferguson in the days of the old First Division. United picked up only seven points from their first seven games of the 1989-90 season, a run that brought successive defeats to Derby, Norwich and Everton and ended with a famous 5-1 thrashing by Manchester City at Maine Road. United ended up 13th that season, but lifted the FA Cup as Ferguson won his first trophy in England. PA MediaAfter nine points from seven games this season, after 19 goals in their last 21 games, after an awkwardly imbalanced side lurched to another less-than-impressive result, the temptation is to start looking down rather than up. The gulf to City seems unbridgeable, at least in the short term, at least while Pep Guardiola remains in situ – and given how adroitly City’s present owners have planned everything so far, they’re as well placed to manage that transition as any side could be. The reports that Giovanni van Bronckhorst is already being groomed as his successor is indicative of a long-term perspective alien to the vast majority of clubs.The question now is rather how low United could go. The financial structure of modern football means there’s not going to be another relegation, as in 1974, and given how tightly bunched the league is, 10th isn’t necessarily as bad as it may appear. But United could easily finish behind Leicester City this season, and perhaps West Ham and Everton as well. There are no guarantees even of Europa League football.And that was what was most striking about Monday. It looked like a mid-table game and it felt like a mid-table game. Apart from everybody talking about how great it used to be, United v Arsenal felt like a nonevent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d563450700aeea16eaf3c85f71fab7c17545673/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7282e8587bbb57ff83a61284d9638dd0","title":"the rise of monarchism","story":"Some are searching for a return to tradition, some are yearning for stability, while for others the rise of Trump is the spurSean wasn’t always a monarchist. The history graduate student, who’s in his early 20s, grew up Catholic in central Massachusetts in what he described as “a pretty staunch Republican household”. But in college, a love of history, particularly the Roman Empire, ultimately drew him to monarchism and away from what he described as the “rah-rah American republicanism” of his childhood.“Most people tend to get more liberal in college,” he told me. While earning his undergraduate degree at a Catholic liberal arts school close to where he grew up, he explained: “I ended up looking into medieval political theory and getting more conservative. The monarchies I find most interesting and think we should replicate go back to the late Middle Ages.”Sean’s views shifted not only thanks to his medieval studies, but also after learning more about US foreign policy.“Having a background in history, I naturally gravitated toward monarchism because I felt that my national government wasn’t looking at issues of public welfare or national coherence or national unity,” he said. “Our political system has been irrevocably poisoned by political partisanship.”I connected with Sean through the message boards of rmonarchism, a growing and erse community of monarchy-lovers on Reddit that boasts almost 10,000 members, and touts itself as “a forum for those who think monarchy is a noble and viable alternative to the crude and materialistic mob mentality of republicanism”. These message boards feature a glut of inspirational images of various monarchs: King George VI going down a slide, Swedish King Carl XVI Gustav, Prince William and his family, and Tsar Nicholas II.Monarchism is still active in around 40 countries, and whatever you may think of the practice, Sean’s analysis of the brokenness of our system is spot on. In the United States, the political atmosphere has been totally spoiled by radical isiveness – a fact exacerbated by Donald Trump’s ascent into the Oval Office. The notion that something is deeply wrong with how our government works is inescapable, so it’s no surprise that people are searching for alternative ideologies.When you think of monarchy, you might think of an inbred Habsburg – the family’s distinctive jaw, how generations of rulers crippled by a variety of diseases due to their tendency to marry within the immediate family. But for Sean and other members of the subreddit, monarchism is not merely about having a supreme ruler and an inherited throne. Most members of the community deplore authoritarian regimes. They aren’t simply searching for order via a supreme leader, but a return to tradition. “A monarchy is based around the nation showing respect for its past, its people and the culture,” one Reddit user explained.Of course, there are many different kinds of monarchists. There are the absolutists who tend to favor hereditary supreme rule, and there are those who think the ideal form of government is close to what Great Britain has right now (a democracy paired with a monarch who serves a ceremonial role as head of state).For an American monarchist like Sean, his preferred system of government “is some manner of elective monarchy modeled to a degree after what you saw in the Holy Roman Empire”, he told me. “The inidual governor of each of the 50 states could vote amongst themselves on a new monarch in the event of an emperor stepping down … One of the reasons that I, and many others, favor monarchy, has to do with the benefits that a single inidual can have when it comes to matters of foreign policy, international relations, international trade, et cetera.”Others were drawn to monarchy more explicitly because of Trump. One self-identified American semi-constitutionalist explained: “I always had some monarchist sympathies, but I went full turncoat when I saw how moronically people were treating politics after 2016 and realized that our current system was breeding a bunch of nutjobs. After that I became convinced that a monarch or something is needed to keep politicians and the like in check.”“Historical amnesia,” Sean Yom, an associate professor of political science at Temple University told me, when I asked him what might possess someone to become a monarchist in 2019. “There’s a collective amnesia about how bad certain kinds of political systems really were.” Yom specifically studies contemporary Middle Eastern monarchies, and noted that many of the participants in the subreddit seemed to be “from fairly developed western countries where the notion of monarchism wrapped largely in warm historical overtones”.In 2018, the New York Times cited a study conducted by a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, which discovered “‘robust and quantitatively meaningful evidence’ that monarchies outperform other forms of government”, and provide nations with “stability that often translates into economic gains”.“I think it’s nostalgia,” Mauro Guillen, the Wharton professor who conducted the study, told me when I asked him why monarchy would appeal to a modern-day American or German. “They like the pomp and circumstance,” he said. “Maybe they’re traditionalists, and they like something that provides continuity.” He also pointed out that Hollywood, and specifically Disney, with its famous princesses, has been culturally influential when it comes to the public perception of a monarchical government.But the simple yearning for stability is a big reason why people who are not octogenarian royals are embracing this form of government. “When I was younger I thought monarchy was stupid and made no sense, like most children who were raised on republican (not the American political party) propaganda,” one Reddit user explained to me. “I can’t remember a specific moment when I thought for the first time, ‘monarchy is the best form of government,’ it was just a gradual change. Why am I a monarchist? I’m a monarchist because I believe that monarchy produces a stable government and unites a people, it produces leaders who were taught from birth to lead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/704714cd49500fb607f34f8116659064408da32a/317_133_3681_2209/master/3681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe0fa67de279d55c13869e4722e5e1e3","title":"naga munchetty bbc reverses decision to censure presenter","story":"Director general Tony Hall emails staff to say he is overturning ruling over impartiality guidelinesThe BBC has reversed its decision to sanction BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty for breaking impartiality guidelines with her comments about Donald Trump, following a staff uprising against the ruling and enormous political pressure.Tony Hall, the BBC director general, emailed all staff on Monday to say he had reviewed the decision following internal and external protests. He said that, on reflection, the BBC’s complaints unit had made the wrong call when they ruled against Munchetty, one of the BBC’s most prominent minority ethnic journalists, for expressing a personal response to the US president’s statement in July that four American congresswomen of colour should “go home”.Asked about Trump’s comments on BBC Breakfast, Munchetty said: “Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.”The U-turn over censuring her came after the  obtained leaked internal correspondence casting doubts on public claims about the complaints process made by a senior BBC executive, as he attempted to explain why Munchetty’s co-host Dan Walker had escaped punishment, despite taking part in the same discussion.The BBC’s editorial standards director, David Jordan, said Walker could not have been investigated because the single viewer complaint which led to the ruling did not mention the male presenter. “The simple fact is we haven’t had a complaint about Dan Walker’s role,” he said in one interview. “The complaint was about Naga Munchetty.”However, copies of the viewer’s complaint leaked to the  show that the original correspondence was explicitly about both Munchetty and Walker, leading to internal anger from BBC employees who demanded that women and minority ethnic journalists should be treated fairly by the corporation.The original complaint from a member of the public was titled “Blatant political bias from both presenters” and described Walker as “very unprofessional”, with the member of the public making clear that they blamed the male presenter for leading Munchetty into making the comments.The original complaint said: “Dan Walker, whilst interviewing a guest about President Trump’s recent tweets regarding 4 Democrat politicians in the USA, repeatedly expressed incredulity that anybody could defend Trump’s tweets. Very unprofessionally, he then asked his fellow presenter Naga Munchetty for her personal opinions on this news story! She foolishly complied with his request and launched into an attack on Trump, including stating that she was personally ‘furious’ about his comments. “These two presenters have never made any secret of their left-wing and anti-Trump bias but usually in more subtle ways, such as eye-rolling and looks of exasperation when reporting on news stories. However, personal commentary on controversial news stories is surely going too far and is way outside of their remit. They are employed as presenters not political commentators and as such should at least feign impartiality. It’s about time they were reminded of this.”The BBC insisted Jordan had not lied in the interviews when he said that Walker was not mentioned. They said Jordan was only referring to a revised version of the complaint, submitted by the same member of the public, which had been elevated to the corporation’s executive complaints unit. The BBC said this final version of the viewer complaint was solely about Munchetty, meaning it could not investigate Walker for his role in the discussion.On Monday night, BBC employees said the issue had reignited wider concerns about on-screen ersity at the corporation and how the BBC treated prominent senior white, male journalists differently to staff from a minority ethnic background.“People don’t care if it’s a conspiracy or not it just exposes the hypocrisy at the BBC,” said one senior journalist. “It’s come out by chance but it’s symptomatic of the arrogance of how BBC management treats women and people of colour. What’s really important is that Naga has said nothing and done nothing to encourage this, people have reacted spontaneously. This has got so big because journalists have just got together on their own and complained.”BBC journalists described growing concerns about the broadcaster’s role in an ongoing culture war which uses the BBC’s news coverage as a battleground for settling political scores, with particular concerns about a sometimes opaque complaints process that can be influenced by a single persistent member of the public.The U-turn followed several days in which the BBC management staunchly defended the original decision, insisting that although Munchetty was allowed to call Trump’s comments racist and offer a verdict on how they made her feel as a woman of colour, she could not cast aspersions on his character.The BBC had originally attempted to defend the decision, with Jordan saying it was not its role to be “calling out people for being liars or racist”.However, the corporation had come under intense political pressure to change direction, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, calling for it to be reconsidered and Labour MP Seema Malhotra organising a letter to Hall, signed by 100 MPs, calling for a meeting to discuss the decision.Hall’s email to BBC staff explained why he had changed direction: “I have looked carefully at all the arguments that have been made and assessed all of the materials. I have also examined the complaint itself,” he said. “It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and difficult judgments.“But, in this instance, I don’t think Naga’s words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made. There was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear. She is an exceptional journalist and presenter and I am proud that she works for the BBC.“I have asked the editorial and leadership teams to discuss how we manage live exchanges on air around these topics in the future. Our impartiality is fundamental to our journalism and is what our audiences expect of us.”However, Hall fell short of apologising to Munchetty and did not address the issue of Jordan’s comments or why Walker had not be investigated for taking part in the discussion. On Friday, the BBC’s entire team of executives – including Hall - signed a public letter which backed the original decision, a position that has now been abandoned.The decision also raises major questions about the BBC’s ability to enforce its impartiality guidelines in the future, given the director general has now shown himself willing to intervene and overturn ruling by the semi-independent complaints unit in face of public pressure. The corporation’s management has been struggling to stop its journalists speaking out in a personal capacity on issues such as the Munchetty ruling and LGBT rights, with staff increasingly willing to ignore warnings from bosses to stay quiet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1278ca8f9705e50461f23da3d962bb6d0d567cc/214_120_5461_3277/master/5461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=304699527f5e80144f245aac4fcaefab","title":"bob marleys london home gets one of few blue plaques for black artists","story":"Plaque at Chelsea house where reggae star lived in the 70s one of ‘unacceptably low’ number Benjamin Zephaniah was a schoolboy when he sent a letter to Bob Marley along the lines of: “I’m a poet from Birmingham, nobody’s really listening to me in England, what do you think of my poems?”Incredibly, the reggae star wrote back and told him: “Young man, Britain needs you. Keep doing what you do.”Marley’s handwritten letter from Jamaica was one reason Zephaniah was where he was, he said on Tuesday, as he unveiled an English Heritage blue plaque on the house in Chelsea where the singer lived in 1977.“That was a real inspiration to me,” said Zephaniah. “It really inspired me to keep doing what I was doing … at the time there was no spoken word poetry, there was no dub poetry so to read those words...”The plaque is on the front of 42 Oakley Street, a house where Marley lived with his band the Wailers for a short time in the late 70s. When they were not recording they would make the short trip over the Albert Bridge to play football in Battersea Park.It was while living in Oakley Street that Marley and the Wailers finished recording Exodus, the album which featured Jamming, Three Little Birds, Waiting in Vain and One Love.Zephaniah said he was a fan of Marley when it was not so fashionable. “Certainly the Rastafarian community thought I was a bit soft. They were listening to Burning Spear and all the heavy stuff, but I liked the songs and poetry of Bob Marley. Take away the music and you get poetry.”About 12 blue plaques are unveiled in London by English Heritage every year, celebrating figures from history. Seven doors up from Marley is one marking the Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott. Across the road, at number 87, is a plaque for the Irish nationalist poet Jane Wilde, Oscar’s mother.Other music stars of Marley’s generation with blue plaques include Jimi Hendrix, in Mayfair, John Lennon, in Marylebone, and Freddie Mercury, in Feltham.The historian David Olusoga, a trustee of English Heritage and a blue plaques panel member, said the organisation was well aware the figure was “unacceptably low”.He added: “Bob Marley’s plaque is testament to how our scheme is changing, as English heritage continues to work to overcome the obstacles that have led to this underrepresentation.”English Heritage said there were a number of reasons for the low figure, including a low number of nominations and the frequent lack of historic records linking a person to a building in which they lived.Marley is a case in point. His plaque became stuck in the planning process because he was not on the electoral register or in the phone book and getting firm evidence was tricky.Researchers did, however, discover a court record of Marley’s arrest for cannabis possession in 1977, along with bassist Aston ‘Family man’ Barrett. Barrett’s address was 42 Oakley Street while Marley’s was given as 27 Collingham Gardens.Anecdotal evidence has suggested Marley gave a different address to prevent the police from searching the house in Oakley Street for drugs and getting more people in trouble.Olusoga said Marley was one of the most recognisable people to have ever lived. “What mattered to millions of people was not just that he was an undoubted musical genius, but that he was somebody who came from a life like theirs. He had been born into poverty. To millions of people in the developing world he was the first global figure from their background.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6bd84eb1acec86c3be0aa60c66d5544910b6ad6/0_939_2686_1611/master/2686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a9f83a9a2822d8f60e35cc0e02067e6","title":"jessye norman american soprano stars legend","story":"She was a a so grand she needed a Rolls Royce to take her across the street. Martin Kettle kicks off stars’ tributes to the great American sopranoJessye Norman’s voice was a force of nature, a gift from the gods. When you went to hear her sing, you always knew exactly what you would get. Sumptuous, creamy and voluptuous tone was Norman’s trademark, along with a meticulous attention to text and expression. For some, it was all too grand and undifferentiated, like a meal in which the richness of the food was overwhelming and unchanging in every course. But the sheer vocal splendour that Norman produced was the sort of sound that comes only once in a lifetime.Yet Norman was not just an unforgettable voice. She was an unforgettable public presence – an African American presence – in every event in which she participated. The knowingness that marked her vocal art extended seamlessly to her public conduct. Her choices on Desert Island Discs did not include her own recordings (which, given her personality, they might easily have done) but Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech. She was a majestic figure in every sense, and she knew from the start of her career to the end that she was also an embodiment of her black brothers and sisters. She would never be anybody’s second-class citizen. And she never was.Norman was not the breakthrough African American singer of 20th-century America. Those imperishable accolades belonged to Marian Anderson and, a little later, to Leontyne Price, who each made the breaches in the whites-only world of classical music and opera. But she was in every way Price’s successor as the flag carrier for her people in the concert halls and opera houses of the US and the wider world. Like Price, she came from the south and developed her voice in church choirs. But, perhaps even more than Price, Norman embraced her iconic status in wider American life as an integral part of the gift she possessed.Norman’s operatic career had to take account of both her vocal richness and her substantial height. She never possessed an athletic stage presence, and she was not really an ensemble actor. The roles that suited her best were often statuesque, where her character’s emotional presence was able to dominate. Her Elizabeth in Wagner’s Tannhäuser and, in particular, her Cassandre in Berlioz’s Les Troyens, which she sang at Covent Garden, were characterisations of this kind. Later, she excelled in the title role of Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos, to which the tragic dignity of her vocal breadth was perfectly suited. Though she sang Mozart with total commitment, her voice was simply too big and her personality too grand to fit into such quicksilver writing.Stories of Norman’s imperious behaviour were common in the musical world. She could be uncompromising about the standards she expected from herself and others. And she was said to require to be collected in a Rolls Royce. But she never lost her lofty status as a great artist. When Herbert von Karajan, another difficult and imperious personality, was preparing for what was likely to be his final appearance at the Salzburg festival, it was Norman he wanted by his side, to sing Isolde’s Liebestod.Concerts were Norman’s ideal milieu, especially as her career entered its final years. Her range was great. She sang everything from art songs to spirituals. She was magnificent in large choral works, such as Schoenberg’s Gurrelieder under Pierre Boulez in the Proms at the Albert Hall. But she was the go-to singer for the great public American occasion, notably the presidential inaugurations of Ronald Reagan (about which, as a Democrat, she had trepidation) and later Bill Clinton. There may not have been many operas for which Norman was the ideal choice, but she was in every sense a larger than life and irreplaceable artist.‘An unflinching connection to the eternal’Rufus Wainwright, singersongwriterRarely do all the essential elements of the performing arts combine in one human being. Stature, intelligence, a sense of movement, attention to detail, generosity to the public and above all that voice. All of these plus a little bit of magic imbued La Norman with what I love most about opera: a solid and unflinching connection to the eternal. Thank you Jessye for lighting the path to the universe.‘After dinner, she put on an apron and did the dishes’Clive Gillinson, artistic director of Carnegie HallI got to know Jessye 50 years ago when I was a player, and then managing director, at the London Symphony Orchestra. We became friends: she had a house in London, and used to invite people round for the most spectacular dinners. She did the cooking and then we’d stand round the sink while she put on an apron and did the washing up! I remember also going dancing at Annabel’s with her – she was an incredible dancer. Very flamboyant, as you would expect.‘A big personality with a magnetic presence’Lawrence Brownlee, tenorHer musicality, her versatility, her eloquence in many languages and her standing in the world of classical music made Jessye Norman an icon and a role model for every singer of any nationality and any colour. But for me, as a young black American singer, she inspired me and gave me belief and hope that I could be successful too. As an established singer, I met her several times. She invited me to give a recital at the school she helped set up – the Jessye Norman School of the Arts in her home town of Augusta, Georgia.Over dinner I discovered that she had been following my career, and even knew which show I was in. We kept in touch and she continued to watch and support me. She was at a stage in her life when she didn’t need to pay it forward, but she did, always. She was effusive in her compliments and really cared about me. She wanted to encourage me and my peers and see us succeed.She was undeniably a big personality, a magnetic and strong presence on stage. She was one of the last remaining as, a very bold singer who brought commitment and charisma to everything she did. She was one of the greatest of her generation in German repertoire, but what I love about her was that as a musician she simply wanted to communicate. She dealt with racism, and she talked about people not wanting to give her her dues, but she was extremely resilient and focused. She let her voice speak for her.‘She wasn’t going to let anyone stop her’Judith Weir, composerWe worked together on a song cycle, woman.life.song, that was at the Proms in 2000. It’s a project she dreamed up and was very intimately involved in the nitty gritty of shaping over the several years it took to develop. I remember she would send me very businesslike but charming faxes – now alas too faded to read. I wish I’d photographed them.I found her extremely professional, well informed and a joy to work with. I know she had a reputation for being a a, but that was not my experience. She spent so much of her life on the road that I think her exacting demands (about, say, air conditioning) were born of her experiences of what could have and had gone wrong. At the Proms, I remember being struck by the audience she had brought in – it was the first time I’d seen so many people of colour there. Thank goodness things are changing now, but she was about 20 years ahead of her time. She knew that boundaries, whether of colour or gender, had to be broken and she wasn’t going to let anyone stop her.‘Wide open spaces shrank in her hands’Iain Burnside, pianistI never saw a singer dominate a space the way Jessye could. The wide open spaces of the Royal Festival Hall shrank in her hands. Every gesture, vocal and physical, carried to the back wall. I treasure her incredible spun line in Strauss’s Wiegenlied and her power in Zueignung. Her high-cheekboned smile will never be surpassed. She conveyed joy like no one else. A couple of years ago, I met her at a dinner and drove her back to her hotel. She squeezed my leg as she said thank you and I thought that my life was complete.‘Despite the odds, she commanded attention’Sir Willard White, bass baritoneShe approached everything she did, every role, with total commitment. She commanded attention, despite all the odds – in a way, she was actually inspired by the odds. She set such a high standard that she was intimidating and inspiring at the same time. Of her recordings, I would single out her Four Last Songs for its elegance and beauty. She showed how it should be done.‘Jessye will live on in our hearts’ Joyce DiDonato, mezzo sopranoThe voice was instantly recognisable, the phrasing supreme, the persona larger than life, and the impact eternal. Jessye’s onstage legacy will remain with us all, but her impact off stage changed lives and will continue to live on through her towering example, mentorship, leadership and passion. She will live on in our hearts for ever.• Interviews by Imogen Tilden"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f6bd3340dff3c4350e0cfd48c90cd8f76b5638f/0_130_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3edaf42592fbdc3d145b92554c825042","title":"jessye norman life in pictures","story":"Singing with Jon Bon Jovi, performing La Marseillaise in Paris, receiving a medal from Obama … we remember the many sides of the great American opera singer, who has died aged 74"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dd571c3f328731f92c7ab96a6bd50aa80177f6/0_0_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a974970140b8c194c5d8aff7cd26563c","title":"is it over for justin trudeau podcast","story":"The Canadian prime minister achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future less certain.

The company was founded and run by Boris Johnson’s friend Jennifer Arcuri after she had moved back to the US.Speaking to the , she said: “It is a complete mystery to me how this company got anywhere near the money.”The DCMS has launched a review into how the grant was made and withheld £53,000 that is yet to be transferred to Hacker House.James, who resigned as a minister a week before Johnson became prime minister, said: “I’m totally appalled that the money was awarded to this company. Although it didn’t get my sign-off I was the minister responsible at the time, so that’s why I want to know now, belatedly, what happened.”Matt Warman, a DCMS undersecretary, insisted last week that the department had done the “usual due diligence” over Hacker House before awarding the money.“This is a company that is based in Britain as far as Companies House is concerned. It is a company with a British phone number,” he told the Commons. But when the  phoned the UK number it got through to the US and when a reporter visited its UK-registered address he was told it was a “virtual office” and staff were based elsewhere.James, who is one of 21 Tory MPs to have had the whip removed after rebelling on Brexit, said doubts about the company’s links to the UK were “obvious a mile off”. She added: “Anyone can register at Companies House and provide a British number.”She pointed out that the grant was designed to foster UK skills and was eligible only for genuinely UK-based companies. “We need the digital skills gap to be closed in the UK, not the bloody US,” she said.Asked if she thought officials had been hoodwinked, she said: “I think that is the kindest explanation. I didn’t insist on ministerial oversight of the various applications. Perhaps I should have done with the benefit of hindsight. I would have look at the revenues and thought what’s going on here. We don’t want startups, we need companies with a proven track record.”James also called for a “full and frank” review into what went wrong and for the department to avoid a government tendency to “close ranks”. She said: “I don’t think anyone has got any chance of sweeping it under the carpet. It is too out in the open now.”Separately, it has emerged that when Arcuri first launched a website for Hacker House in 2015, it included a promotional video featuring Johnson endorsing her previous company, Innotech, and referring to Arcuri by her first name.In the video, Johnson says: “Viva Innotech folks, and forward with all your deliberations. Will that do, Jennifer? Can I go now?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

The US Anti-Doping Agency found that Salazar had been “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” while head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, a group that was initially set up to help US endurance athletes beat the best runners from Africa but later recruited Farah and others from around the world.Farah, who trained with Salazar from 2010 until 2017, admitted he was happy the investigation had finally concluded. “I’m relieved that Usada has, after four years, completed their investigation into Alberto Salazar,” he said in a statement. “I left the Nike Oregon Project in 2017 but as I’ve always said, I have no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line. A ruling has been made and I’m glad there has finally been a conclusion.”Salazar was found by an arbitration panel to have trafficked testosterone – a banned performance-enhancing substance – to multiple athletes, administered a prohibited IV infusion, and also tampered or attempted to tamper with Nike Oregon Project athletes’ doping control process.Jeffrey Brown, who worked as a paid consultant endocrinologist for Nike on performance enhancement and served as a physician for many of Salazar’s athletes, also received a four-year ban. In a statement, Travis Tygart, the CEO of US Anti-Doping, praised the numerous whistleblowers who had come forward and condemned Salazar and Brown’s behaviour.“The athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,” he added. “While acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr Salazar and Dr Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect.”The IAAF, athletics’ governing body, later confirmed that it had “deactivated” his accreditation. But the 61-year-old Salazar who watched one of his athletes, Sifan Hassan, win the 10,000m gold earlier this week, said he was “shocked” by the outcome and would appeal against it. “The Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping,” he said. “I will appeal and look forward to this unfair and protracted process reaching the conclusion I know to be true.”“Throughout this six-year investigation my athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from Usada,” he added. “This is demonstrated by the misleading statement released by Travis Tygart stating that we put winning ahead of athlete safety. This is completely false and contrary to the findings of the arbitrators, who even wrote about the care I took in complying with the world anti-doping code.”Farah was with Salazar for nearly seven years during which time he went from being just outside elite level to virtually unbeatable. He stuck with his famed coach after allegations against Salazar first surfaced in a BBC and ProPublica report in 2015 and only left in 2017. At the time, Farah denied his decision was connected to the doping claims. Usada first brought doping charges against Salazar and Brown in June 2017 in a court battle that was heard behind closed doors.One of the BBC and Propublica’s key whistleblowers, Steve Magness, who worked as Salazar’s assistant, tweeted after Usada’s statement: “Tell the truth. Own your mistakes. Choose the difficult path. In the short term, it might feel horrible, but over the long haul it’s the only path to take. Speak up, stay true to your convictions. None of us are perfect. But we can all aspire to be better.”Nick Willis, a two-time Olympic medalist over 1500m, also said he was delighted at the news. “Justice. I’m tired of having to hide my thoughts. The charade is finally over. Our sport will be much better off with Alberto gone.”Meanwhile, Nike said that it would back Salazar’s appeal and that Usada’s decision had “nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete”.“As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the world anti-doping code. We support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require. Nike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner.”In a statement UK Athletics defended its decision to stick with Salazar after revelations against him first surfaced in 2015. “It should be noted that at all times UK Athletics fully cooperated with both Usada and Ukad throughout the investigations,” it added. “Furthermore the performance oversight committee’s own investigation in 2015 was restricted to the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with Mo Farah. and not an anti-doping investigation. Such investigations can and should only be undertaken by the relevant anti-doping authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fbf750eaf8d610f64549c83e02f783879a9cad6/104_52_2670_1601/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9594bf8a613aef5feb6ca569a1cf07a1","title":"england are boring says argentina hooker rugby world cup","story":"Agustin Creevy has described England as boring and claimed that the World Cup match on Saturday will be “like a war”. The hooker, who has captained Argentina 49 times, spent two seasons in the Premiership with Worcester and also believes that gives him inside knowledge on the Pumas’ opponents this weekend.“Maybe my play in Worcester helped to see the way it will come on Saturday. They always play the same way in history. They are really structured and that for me is really good. I improved a lot.”Creevy relinquished the Argentina captaincy after four years in 2018 but he remains one of the most feared hookers in world rugby. He has faced England five times and lost on each occasion – the Pumas have not won in their past nine meetings since their 2009 victory – but he is relishing the challenge that awaits.“Saturday is going to be like a war, it’s like a final for us,” said Creevy, who arrived at Worcester in 2013. “I think the battle with the forwards will be the game. We need to win the scrum, win the lineout, win the maul, win the contact, the breakdown.“When we put on this shirt we feel something different. It’s our country, our family, my club. We play together, the group is really bonded. That is different to different teams. We love each other, and I think that is different to other teams. We are friends, we are brothers, inside and outside the field.”Argentina are traditionally known for a strong set-piece being the bedrock of their game. Their scrum was among the most disappointing aspects of a poor Rugby Championship this summer, but was vastly improved in their narrow defeat by France in their opening match.“We trained a lot. Our skills in the scrums and the mentality, we worked a lot in that,” Creevy said. “I think we are improving a lot in the scrum and we feel good, but we need to continue. The England scrum is really good.”Creevy is vying for selection in the No 2 jersey with Julian Montoya, who scored a hat-trick and was named man of the match in the victory against Tonga on Saturday. The 34-year-old is certain to be part of the matchday squad, however, and win his 88th international cap.“I’m really proud. I can’t explain with words, and in English it’s really difficult. I’m really proud to get 88 games with this shirt. I never imagined that, it’s a dream for me. I’m really happy. I think about my club, family, a lot of things I did and that was hard.

The men set off first and the women replaced them on the road as soon as the second male rider crossed the finish line. Final timings were taken when the second female rider crossed the line.It was the first UCI-sanctioned international para-cycling event to take place alongside the UCI road world championships and was used as a qualifier for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.The route headed in a south-westerly direction out of Northallerton, followed by a short, sharp ascent on the outskirts of Masham.

There are reasons to be suspicious about this origin myth. Like the idea, wildly implausible to anyone even vaguely acquainted with the species, that any self-respecting English PE teacher would have praised Webb Ellis’s wit and ingenuity rather than cursed him for his pig-ignorance and set him to doing press-ups in punishment. Still, that’s the story and, two centuries later, it’s Webb Ellis’s name on the trophy that they’re all playing for over here in Japan.For a game that started with “a fine disregard” for the rules, rugby has grown into one that has become irritatingly pernickety about them. This World Cup tournament is supposed to be all about opening the game up to a new audience. One of the main sponsors is running an ad campaign about a confused man in a crowd of rugby fans who isn’t sure whether or when he is supposed to be cheering, until he finally realises it doesn’t much matter anyway. “You don’t need to know all the rules”, their slogan goes. A good thing, too, because they have grown so byzantine that even the experts don’t always seem to agree on them any more.Throughout the opening rounds of this tournament it felt like every other match ended in a spat about who hit who how, when and why and where they did it, and exactly what their punishment ought to be. And all that’s before you even get into the tit-for-tat whatabout of what the guy on the other side got up to in the 52nd minute. The referees don’t seem to agree with the judicial committees, who keep clashing with the coaches, whose players seem to be confused about what they are being told to do by World Rugby, whose instructions seem to be at odds with a lot of what the referees are doing on the field.So we have seen tackles the referee and television match official didn’t think were worth so much as a penalty, but which the disciplinary panel then decided deserved a three-week ban. Tackles that, one head coach was convinced, should have cost the opposition a penalty try, but which went entirely unpunished. Tackles where the referee and television match official agreed there were mitigating circumstances, but the disciplinary panel didn’t, so the players who made them ended up being given the very same sentence as the guy whose appallingly cynical shoulder charge damn near decapitated the man at whom it was aimed.“I am embarrassed here,” said Australia’s head coach, Michael Cheika. “I do not understand any more.” Well, Cheika tends to blow hard when he’s hot. But it’s not just him. After Samoa had two players suspended, their defence coach, Alistair Rogers, put in a special request to World Rugby’s high-performance manager, Alain Rolland, for more clarity on exactly what his players were supposed to be doing in the tackle. This was just days after Rolland told us all he was confident that the teams all understood the details of the new high tackle framework because he and his deputies had personally briefed them on it all right before the tournament.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterThe strange part is that reason they introduced this new framework was so that, as one of the men who designed it explained in a recent podcast, everyone can look at the same tackle and see the same thing. It’s all part of World Rugby’s ongoing effort to overhaul the entire culture of the sport. Which they need to do, and soon, because a game where some concussed players are launching negligence lawsuits against their clubs, and others are being forced into early retirement on medical advice, isn’t going to have much of a long-term future, however many new fans it makes in these few weeks.They are even prepared for the coaches to kick back at it, because they know that they will complain about anything which compromises their team’s performance.What is more problematic is that lack of consistency between what they are saying, what the referees and television match officials are doing, and the judicial review groups are deciding in those hearings. Between them, they are delivering mixed messages. It feels like there has been a communication breakdown. It was a bad omen that no one at the ground has been able to listen to the conversations between the refereeing team during this World Cup because the special ref mic app World Rugby has developed has been broken since the beginning of the tournament. This is difficult stuff, players and referees are making split‑second calls. But right now, World Rugby has got a lot of angry coaches, confused players, inconsistent officials, and befuddled fans. This change in the game is for the good, but it has a long way to go yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d15e7605d06515d0bba590b3c101ba27fe5b572/606_505_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bba29311c226d35a1055b5aea7b91f26","title":"iphone 11 review iphone xr dual camera a13 smartphone","story":"Apple’s lower cost model has latest chips and longer battery life but is identical on outside to predecessorThe iPhone 11 is Apple’s latest lower cost smartphone for 2019 that’s clearly aimed at a broader market, offering most of what its top phones do but for £320 less.Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 is also £20 cheaper than last year’s iPhone XR was on launch – the phone it has now replaced.In fact the iPhone 11 is identical on the outside to the iPhone XR in almost all the ways that matter. It’s the same size and weight. It’s got the same glass and aluminium design, same 6.1in LCD screen with rounded corners, the same large notch at the top and same thick bezels around the sides.Flip it over and it’s got the same glass rear, except that “iPhone” is no longer written on the back and the Apple logo is positioned lower. The biggest difference is the new large, square camera lump in the top left corner, which on the iPhone 11 houses a new dual camera system.The phone is well built, feeling extremely solid and it has the best LCD screen you’re likely to see on a phone although it isn’t as good-looking, colour rich, bright or high contrast as the OLED screens fitted to the iPhone 11 Pro or Apple’s many rivals costing £500 and up.The iPhone 11 also suffers from the same disadvantages as the iPhone XR before it, namely it’s fairly heavy and wide with rounded edges that provide little in the way of grip. Compared to Samsung’s Galaxy S10, which has the same size 6.1in screen, the iPhone 11 is 5.3mm wider and 37g heavier and significantly harder to use one-handed.The iPhone 11 shares the same core as the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage. It’s the fastest and most efficient of Apple’s chips yet, but the reality is that it’s very difficult to tell. The iPhone 11 doesn’t feel any faster than last year’s iPhone XRXS, or in fact the iPhone X in day-to-day usage.That’s not surprising as Apple focuses its chips on doing the things you’d normally do more efficiently, with power to do something unusual if you need it. That means the iPhone 11 should still be a top-performer in two, three, maybe four years from now. So really the only thing you need to know is that the iPhone 11 will handle everything you are likely to do, and then some.Apple also says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 last an hour longer than the iPhone XR, which lasted 32 hours between charges in my testing.I’m happy to report that’s a bit of an underestimate. The iPhone 11 lasts closer to 35 hours between charges, which makes it the longest-lasting iPhone to have crossed my test bench, getting me from 7am though until 6pm the following day.That was after the iOS 13.1.1 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The iPhone 11 came out of the box with iOS 13 but was quickly updated to iOS 13.1 and then iOS 13.1.1, which was a good thing, as prior to the updates it was filled with bugs giving me all kinds of issues on three different iPhone 11 series phones.First off, the camera confirmation for restoring it from another iPhone didn’t work. Then I was immediately stuck in a password-demand loop for an email account, which ended up with me having to hit the cancel button and then quickly enter one character of my 35-character password before the password demand popped back up blocking me from entering more. Hit cancel, rinse and repeat. Absolutely infuriating.I had issues with location permissions getting stuck on “ask every time” for some apps. I also had several hard lockups of the phone prompting the three-button combo force restart procedure (up, down, hold power for ages), text in widgets and other areas was compressed and overlapping each other, and sometimes the camera failed to activate when launched.Most of the problems have been solved since the update to iOS 13.1.1, and it even added an extra hour to my battery tests.The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which turns the interface from a predominately black text on white background to white text on a dark background, either manually or on a schedule.You can now also long-press on control centre buttons such as Bluetooth or wifi, first to open a up more detail, then a second time to open up a quick connect menu as well as a button to take you straight to the appropriate place in the settings app for more extensive changes. It is a user-friendly feature that Android has had for years, so it’s good to finally see Apple catch up.A few new privacy options are welcome, including the ability to silence unknown and spam callers and finer-grain location permissions. Menstrual cycle tracking is now integrated into the Health app alongside headphone audio level, and there’s a new summary view, which makes the app more friendly and useful at a glance.It’s worth pointing out that Apple still provides the industry’s longest software support lifecycle of about five years from release where the best rivals cap out at about three years. It means you can safely use the phone for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates.The iPhone 11 has a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back. Oddly you get an ultra-wide camera alongside a standard camera, not the more typical 2x optical zoom camera. That means you’ve effectively got 0.5x and 1x optical zoom then up to 5x digital zoom, which is good, but doesn’t hold a flame to real optical zoom.Apple has significantly upped its game in the camera department this year, particularly in poor lighting conditions. Photos in good lighting conditions are some of the best on a smartphone, producing detail-rich and colour-accurate photos. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with.Other than your typical ultra-wide vistas, you can also use the new camera to photograph more of a building or object you can’t get far enough away from to use the main camera.Portrait mode is good too, and unlike on the XR can be used on more than just people. Apple’s smart HDR mode is also improved, producing images that are closer to class-leading Google Pixel cameras. But the biggest boost is Apple’s new night mode, which finally brings the iPhone’s very low-light performance up to scratch with the very best.It’s not as fast as Huawei’s P30 Pro, which doesn’t need a special night mode to shoot similar photos, nor quite as dramatic as Google’s Pixel 3, but produces images that are often lighter and better controlled.The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you are shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots – something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain.The iPhone still struggles a little with indoor lighting where it’s not quite dark enough to benefit from night mode so produces images that are a little dark and lacking in detail. The selfie camera in particular produces somewhat grainy images here, but shoots great photos in better lighting conditions.Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, and easy to use, arguably better than rivals. The front-facing camera can also offers slow-motion selfies, which kids will love.Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 is a big step up, equalling or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features, although the lack of an optical zoom is disappointing.The iPhone 11 is an excellent but boring smartphone. It’s got a three-year-old design, which Apple broke the mould with in 2017 when it launched the iPhone X but now looks dated against the competition, particularly with the thicker bezels on the LCD screen. Things have moved on in the era of the all-screen smartphone.It’s fairly large, heavy and difficult to grip and use with one hand, but is also extremely well made and feels solid. These are all attributes shared by its predecessor the iPhone XR, as the iPhone 11 is essentially new guts in last year’s design.At £729 the iPhone 11 isn’t exactly cheap, costing the same as the top-of-the-line phones from competitors. But what you get for your £729 is Apple’s latest top-of-the-range processor with performance to match. Battery life that will easily see you into a second day, maybe a third if you’re careful. Camera performance that is up there with the very best, but lacking an optical zoom, replaced instead by a fun ultra-wide angle camera.You also get five years of software updates, which can’t be sniffed at. With a battery swap at some point there’s no reason an iPhone 11 won’t last you five years if you’re careful with it. In some tests the glass appears fairly tough to break, but less so in others, so whether it will survive real-world drops remains to be seen.If your primary driver is to buy the best, cheapest iPhone you can get, that’s the iPhone XR in 2019. If you want the best iPhone you can get, that’s one of the new iPhone 11 Pro line. So where does that leave the iPhone 11?Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, dated design, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Even if, as a queer, non-binary child, she didn’t always feel reflected by the strangling gender norms of Disney films.The 32-year-old animator is now enjoying – and adding to – a very different cartoon landscape. This year, viewers of the children’s show Arthur saw Mr Ratburn marry an aardvark (and chocolatier) named Patrick. In 2017, the Disney animation Doc McStuffins aired an episode featuring an interracial lesbian couple. And, last year, Sugar’s own series, Steven Universe, became the first kids’ show to feature a lesbian wedding.For self-professed geeks in the LGBT community, Sugar is something of a gay-eity. In 2011, she got her break as a writer and storyboard artist on the animated series Adventure Time. She earned six Emmy nominations and a slot on Forbes magazine’s “30 under 30 in entertainment” list for her contribution to many of the best episodes. There, she laid the groundwork for the cult character Marceline, a bisexual vampire queen and one half of the queer cartoon couple dubbed “Bubbline”. In the show’s finale, she and her girlfriend, Princess Bubblegum, sealed their largely offscreen romance with a long-awaited onscreen kiss.Sugar left to continue her work moving LGBT stories from the margins into the mainstream with Steven Universe. In doing so, she became the first woman to independently create a series for Cartoon Network. It is an all-ages sci-fi romp with lots of heart. The titular character is sworn to protect humanity from intergalactic threats, alongside a ragtag gang of ageless alien warriors called Crystal Gems. They project female holographic, humanoid forms from magical gemstones embedded in their bodies, which are akin to brains. This may sound complex, but the show is renowned for its simple approach to often inaccessible themes for children, such as consent, grief, anxiety and abusive relationships.Sugar uses the show to process difficult parts of her personal life. When she was 22, she and her partner (the show’s supervising director, Ian Jones-Quartey, who is black) were the victims of a racist assault. This is addressed in the fan-favourite song Stronger Than You, which is performed by the character Garnet, voiced by the British R\u0026ampB singer Estelle.“There are ways I can talk about my relationship with Ian and the obstacles we face, my own experience with antisemitism, my experience coming out as bisexual as a teenager,” she says. “The layer of fantasy in the show allows me to have fun with truths that are not fun.”Garnet is a queer Trojan horse of sorts. We are introduced to her as a singular character, but it is later revealed that she is a fusion of two Gems called Ruby and Sapphire, who choose to remain fused out of love for each other. When they were married, Ruby, the more masculine of the two, was depicted in a bridal gown, while femme-Gem Sapphire sported a tux – a nightmare for countries that had skirted the depiction of a same-sex relationship by coding Ruby as male.The recent push for ersity in media has seen a rise in “retcon” (“retroactive continuity”) – the addition of new information that alters previously described events. For instance, JK Rowling belatedly revealed that Dumbledore and Grindelwald from the Harry Potter novels had been lovers, a move that was deemed a bandwagon-jumping afterthought. But Ruby and Sapphire’s relationship has been key to Steven Universe since the start. “We wanted you to understand that you already knew Ruby and Sapphire, because you already knew Garnet,” says Sugar. “We tried to bake that into the premise – you already love and care about the relationship between Ruby and Sapphire, because you already love and care about Garnet.”The wedding decision was not taken lightly. Sugar was aware that the episode, as well as her decision to come out as bisexual, could lead to funding being pulled or the show being dropped altogether.Her fears were hardly unfounded: Arthur’s first attempt at LGBT inclusion was shot down in 2005, when its spinoff show, Postcards from Buster, was pulled from PBS after taking flak for featuring a lesbian couple. The anime show Sailor Moon featured a lesbian couple, whom US TV networks opted to portray as cousins. More recently, a Steven Universe episode featuring a “fusion” scene with a lesbian subtext was censored in Britain. The same episode featured heterosexual dancing and kissing. “I decided I would rather do this and face that reality than not do this and have a longer running,” she says.“It was a matter of breaking down the false assumption that same-sex romance is somehow inherently more adult, which it’s not. We needed to show, over and over again, that there was nothing less wholesome about these two characters together than any other animated wedding ever aired on Cartoon Network. And so we worked hard to make these characters as cute and lovable as possible, so there’s just no way to deny that they should be married.”Steven Universe, which has as many adult fans as child fans, isn’t just deemed radical and groundbreaking for its same-sex relationships. One episode nods to polyamory, with a character who consists of six romantically involved Gems called Fluorite. Its exploration of gender is just as celebrated: Steven, a male, and his friend Connie, a female, fuse to create the gender-neutral Steveonnie, who uses “theythem” pronouns. Most notably, Sugar has said that the Gems are non-binary women.“I was writing these characters before I was familiar with a lot of the terminology,” she says. “But it was such a fun way to express myself – particularly in the way that people think they are women, but I know that they are actually not. It is so much the feeling I’ve had navigating my life. I can really make them act and exist outside of the rules that always felt so alienating to me.”This year, Queer Eye’s Jonathan Van Ness and the musician Sam Smith have come out as non-binary, which has been met with equal amounts of support and derision. “But what’s exciting now is that we have ways of finding each other,” Sugar says. “Even if the confusion exists, we are not confused.”Steven himself (based on Sugar’s younger brother) is a direct challenge to the archetypal male hero in most cartoons. His emotional intelligence is his greatest asset in battle. He cries, he uses a pink shield and he is often depicted in a dress in the episode Sadie’s Song, he dons makeup, a crop top, a skirt and heels.Cultural shifts such as this have led critics to suggest we are in a golden age of western animation – shows such as BoJack Horseman, Rick and Morty and Big Mouth also deal artfully with the unsaid. Sugar is held up as a beacon of progress, but she is keenly aware of just how rare a gem she is.“Often, when there are these moments, if you really look at it, it may be coming from two or three people that make several things,” she says. “You think: ‘Wow, this was an era of really innovative storytelling!’ but it’s just a few iniduals fighting for something they really believe in.”Steven

customs patrol cars arriving at a Revenue Commissioners yard in the Border town on Tuesday.A campaign group representing communities along the Border opposed to Brexit have reacted with concern at the arrival of a fleet of new Revenue customs cars in Dundalk, Co Louth.Border Communities Against Brexit posted two photographs online of seven brand new customs patrol cars arriving at a Revenue Commissioners yard in the Border town.The publication of the images online triggered alarm among Border residents and criticism of the Government’s response to Brexit on social media.The group called on the Government to be more open with communities along the Border about how it intends to manage the new EU border should the UK exit at the end of this month without a deal.“This is another example of how the Irish Government are preparing for Brexit,” said a spokesman for the group, referring to the photographs that were posted on its Facebook page on Tuesday afternoon.“Border communities need to be told now in clear and uncertain terms what the Border will look like following a no deal,” he said.“It’s certain that the Irish Government will be bound to follow EU rules pertaining to managing a Border with a third country,” he said, referring to the UK’s post-Brexit status.“The Taoiseach cannot allow communities to be left behind,” he added, warning that the 1998 Belfast Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process were “under attack by Brexit.”‘Getting real now’The Revenue has yet to respond to questions about the purchase of the new customs cars.Images of the new cars arriving in Revenue appeared amid heightened concern about the uncertain future of the Border following Brexit after British prime minister Boris Johnson publicly distanced himself from reports that he was proposing new customs clearance centres on either side of the Border.Seamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association Northern Ireland, responded to the photos on social media, saying that the “reality of Border checks” were “getting real now.”The Government has said that there would have to be checks on goods crossing the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit but has also said it is still in discussion with the EU on where those checks would take place.The Revenue has hired more than 450 people, including some 370 this year, to prepare for Brexit, as part of a phased recruitment of an additional 600 people to deal with the extra work resulting from the UK’s exit.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe provided Revenue with an additional €10 million in last year’s budget for the recruitment of the staff. The uncertainty around the manner and timing of the UK’s departure from the EU and the possibility of a disorderly exit resulted in Revenue accelerating its recruitment plan."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

Probably, we cannot just say in evolution, \u0027Look, I will delete from scratch, from day zero, the muscle going to digits two, three, four, five and I will just keep the one going to the thumb.\u0027 Probably, it is not so easy. “Probably you have to form this layer of this muscle and then it disappears on the other digits but persists on the thumbs.It is thought the muscles were last used by adults  in the evolution from reptile to mammalThe extra hand muscles were lost in our adult ancestors around 250 million years ago - but are present in many other limbed animals such as monkeys.This explains why monkeys are able to climb and manipulate objects with their feet, but in humans the muscles either disappear or become fused with other muscles before birth.Dr Diogo said  It used to be that we had more understanding of the early development of fishes, frogs, chicken and mice than in our own species, but these new techniques allow us to see human development in much greater detail.”He added: “It provides a fascinating, powerful example of evolution at play.”Former BBC chief warns its reputation for impartiality being \u0026#39turned against it\u0026#39 over Naga Munchetty rowJunior lawyer says she was too embarrassed to go to police after her boss \u0026#39groped her\u0026#39 following drunken night outBrexit latest news: Priti Patel compares herself to Margaret Thatcher as she vows to tackle county lines drugs gangsIraqi troops use live fire as Baghdad erupts in protestScottish court to consider whether Boris Johnson could be jailed over no-deal BrexitComment: Britain\u0026#39s frivolous obsession with Boris Johnson\u0026#39s personal life is politically unhealthyPlastic chemical found in food and drink containers may make babies develop breathing problems, study findsComment: Soft power, not sanctions, is the way to mould Chinese thought to Western ways  Komodo Island to charge tourists $1,000 to protect dragon habitatTuesday afternoon news briefing: Senior Tory MP involved in bust-up in VIP lounge at Conservative Party conferenceWashing machines and fridges to be made easily repairable under new EU legislation to cut greenhouse gasesBob Marley may have lied to police during drugs arrest, English Heritage discovers\u0026#39I was told to kill myself for being Tory\u0026#39: Young Conservatives share the abuse they\u0026#39ve suffered for their politicsCulture war over crucifixes and tortellini sparked by calls for Italy to be more inclusive Senior Conservative MP sent home from party conference following bust-up in VIP lounge Britain\u0026#39s most wanted fugitive, Shane O\u0026#39Brien, is found guilty of murderComment: Boris Johnson thinks he has the perfect formula to persuade Left-wing Leavers to abandon LabourHong Kong protester shot in chest during demonstrations on China\u0026#39s 70th anniversary - live updatesAnalysis: Advanced new weaponry lets China steal a march on rivals and exposes US Navy in the PacificWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/30/TELEMMGLPICT000085022305_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"loss common entrance exam dark day british education","story":"Getting to Eton, as these boys have, will no longer mean sitting the rigorous old examA friend of mine says he only passed his Oxford Finals in History because of our top prep school and the Ladybird guide to William the Conqueror he read there.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearNoted commodity trader Peter Brandt predicted bitcoin will continue to fall until it reaches $5,500, but will then continue its upward trajectory.In the long term, he forecasted bitcoin to be worth $50,000 – a figure seen as conservative by some cryptocurrency advocates.Cyber security pioneer John McAfee, who has become a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, stood by a prediction he made in 2017 that bitcoin will see exponential price growth in 2019 and 2020.“Ignore this drop in bitcoin’s price. I am firmly with Peter Brandt in his medium term $50k price prediction,” Mr McAfee tweeted.“I am also firm on my $1m price by the end of 2020. Stop wringing your hands!”It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for bitcoin’s most recent demise, though some have said negative market sentiment can be attributed to the launch of the bitcoin futures platform Bakkt.Pessimism surrounding Bakkt resulted in a mass sell-off, which at one point saw more than $1,000 wiped from bitcoin’s value in the space of 30 minutes.Bitcoin’s notorious volatility could see traders once again plough money into the cryptocurrency in the hope of turning a quick profit, according to market analyst Simon Peters, who works for online trading platform eToro.“Now that bitcoin is now trading below $8,500, it could become an attractive proposition for investors who want to buy the dip,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We could see the price rise back up to $10,000 within the space of the next month.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It makes up over 7 per cent of Britain’s GDP, around 9 per cent of our exports and 11 per cent of all tax receipts.The quarterly survey by the Confederation of British Industry and PwC showed that optimism has plunged at the fastest rate since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, triggering panic around the world. Only 5 per cent of firms are now more upbeat about\u0026nbspoverall business in financial services\u0026nbspthan three months ago, while 62 per cent are less optimistic, giving a balance of -56 per cent.Business volumes declined in the past three months at the fastest pace since September 2012. Banks experienced a particularly alarming fall, with the volume of business dropping more rapidly than at any time since March 1991.Meanwhile, the fall in profits across financial services firms was the worst since June 2009, when Britain was still mired in recession. And firms expected profitability to slide further in the next three months.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two tourists pose for pictures in front of Union and EU flags outside the Houses of Parliament in LondonA sheep on London Bridge as Freemen of the City of London took up their historic entitlement to drive sheep over the bridge, which was once London\u0027s only river crossingAn Aldabra giant tortoise is fed watermelon as a treat at the Malvern Autumn Show, at the Three Counties Showground near Malvern in WorcestershireGallery assistants pose with an artwork entitled \u0027Devolved Parliament\u0027 by British artist Banksy, during a press view in London ahead of Sotheby\u0027s contemporary art sale, as part of the Frieze Art FairEngland\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

Andrew Kail, head of financial services at PwC, said the increase was most probably a response to greater regulation requirements.The poll was conducted between 14 August and 13 September, with 83 firms replying.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The move proved the catalyst in supercharging the site\u0027s already explosive growthYahoo offered $1 billion to buy Facebook in September 2006 but Zuckerberg turned it down. \u0027I don’t know what I could do with the money,\u0027 Zuckerberg reportedly said. \u0027I’d just start another social networking site\u0027515 In the moneyIn September 2009, almost five years since the site launched, Facebook turned a profit for the first time615 Taking the leadFacebook overtook MySpace in 2010 to become the world’s most popular social network715 Taking on the tech giantsIn 2011, Google launched its own social network that it hoped would knock Facebook from its perch. Despite its initial success, Google+ ultimately failed and will be shut down completely in 2019On 18 May, 2012, Facebook went public. The initial public offering raised $16 billion – the third largest in US history915 Gobbling up the competitionFacebook acquired Instagram in April 2012 for $1 billion, consolidating its position as the world\u0027s leading social networkOn 4 October, 2012, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had hit 1 billion users. \u0027If you’re reading this: thank you for giving me and my little team the honour of serving you,\u0027 he wrote in a blog post1115 Expanding its empireIn February 2014 Facebook acquired the messaging app WhatsApp for $19.3 billionIn June 2017, Facebook passed the 2 billion user milestoneOn 17 March 2018, news broke that UK firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from around 87 million Facebook users for the purpose of political profiling in the build up to the 2016 US presidential electionsDespite the scandals and subsequent #DeleteFacebook campaign, Facebook posted record profits just before its 15th anniversary, the equivalent of $7.37 from each of its 2.32 billions usersA study found that people are happier when they don’t use Facebook, adding to mounting evidence surrounding the impact social media has on mental health“I think it’s past Instagram now in India in terms of scale. So yeah, it’s a very interesting phenomenon,” Zuckerberg said.“So we have a number of approaches that we’re going to take towards this, and we have a product called Lasso that’s a standalone app that we’re working on, trying to get product-market fit in countries like Mexico, is I think one of the first initial ones.”Facebook introduced its Lasso earlier this year in Mexico, as it is one of the few countries where TikTok is yet to establish a presence.Facebook buys mind-reading startup CTRL-Labs for $1bnZuckerberg said the aim is to test out the app in Mexico before rolling it out to a global audience.“I think we have time to learn and understand and get ahead of the trend. It is growing, but they’re spending a huge amount of money promoting it,” Zuckerberg said.“What we’ve found is that their retention is actually not that strong after they stop advertising. So the space is still fairly nascent, and there’s time for us to kind of figure out what we want to do here. But I think this is a real thing. It’s good.”Zuckerberg also addressed other challenges facing the company, including its controversial\u0026nbspLibra cryptocurrency.He explained why he refused to testify in some parts of the world to face questions from lawmakers and regulators about the new currency, saying: It just doesn\u0027t really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it’s also very much about a giant blob of goo that consumes everything in its wake. A pre-fame Steve McQueen in his feature film debut is the preppie high-schooler facing off against the aggressive alien entity. Burt Bacharach sings the film’s theme song¬ – driving home The Blob’s kitsch, drive-in-movie charm.210 The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976 Nicholas Roeg)If the experience of being abducted by aliens was translated into a cinematic mood, it would result in something like The Man Who Fell to Earth. It dispenses with all logic and concept of linear time, and instead takes place in a kind of unmoored netherworld (Nicholas Roeg fans will recognise and appreciate it immediately). And its power is punctuated, of course, by the presence of David Bowie, who is beautiful and uncanny, and perfectly cast.310 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 Philip Kaufman)We’re long-overdue a new remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The pod-people premise is effortlessly translated into new decades, and spun into powerful new metaphors for modern threats. But of the many incarnations of Jack Finney’s novel, it’s Philip Kaufman’s 1978 adaptation that remains its most terrifying and daring, exploiting the Cold War paranoia of the era and building to a devastatingly brutal final twist. Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy and a young Jeff Goldblum are among the stars confronted with an alien invasion that replaces the world’s populace with mindless doppelgängers.The original and still the best. And not just in terms of the long-running Alien franchise, but the alien genre as a whole. Chilly and sparse, with moments of languid contemplation interrupted by bloody carnage, Alien is both a haunted house movie and delicate meditation on life, power and authority. HR Giger’s ubiquitous design work remains terrifying, and Sigourney Weaver is an instant star as the compassionate and smart Ellen Ripley.A film that taught a generation of children (and, if we’re being honest, their parents) the importance of friendship, whether shared with an intergalactic gremlin or not. ET is magical cinema and the finest distillation of Steven Spielberg’s power as a filmmaker – emotional but never cloying, otherworldly but always resolutely human, and with a deep understanding and respect for child-like wonder. Anyone who isn’t in a puddle of tears by its conclusion is, I think according to international law, an irredeemable monster.Liquid Sky is a fluorescent revenge tale, a hyper-stylised fever dream, and the most vivid depiction of New York’s underground no-wave scene in the early 1980s. It sees aliens arriving in New York in search of heroin, only to discover better highs via the human orgasm. Meanwhile an aspiring, put-upon model learns that alien powers can be a tool to rid the world of bad people. Liquid Sky touches on sex, drugs, art and androgyny, with eye-candy set design and a transfixing lead performance from Anne Carlisle.Starman is ET if ET was an incredibly handsome 30-something man who looks uncannily like your dead ex. A radical departure for John Carpenter, this 1984 romantic drama sees Karen Allen’s grief-stricken widow spooked and then saved by the arrival of an alien who takes the form of her dead husband. An Oscar-nominated Jeff Bridges stars as the Starman of the title he is astounding, tasked with embodying something odd and otherworldly yet warm enough to be loveable. The film’s climax, in all its aching, deeply romantic glory, is a tribute to maintaining hope in the face of grief, and proof that Carpenter is no one-genre pony.Worth revisiting in the wake of the Amy Adams vehicle Arrival, Contact finds Jodie Foster communicating with aliens and fighting for the right to meet them. It is a still, thoughtful movie, interested in bureaucracy and misogyny in a way that sci-fi movies so often aren’t. But it also recognises the emotional power of marvelling at something extraordinary, and the sheer wonder of cracking open a door to the previously unimaginable.

Are they saying you are only ever three steps away from danger?“Everyone was watching, and knew we were the reason the ride was delayed.“Anyone that knows Sebby has been bored to death by his knowledge and love of Ninjago.”Ms Brett said after they finished on the ride, her son asked her: “Why would they make a disabled person walk? It really hurt.”She added: “If they’d have asked him to do it a month ago he wouldn’t have been able to and it would have ruined the whole day.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They also need to reconsider how inclusive their park is.”She added staff needed better training on how to deal with disabled children.A spokesman for the park apologised for any distress caused to the family, but said the policy was “necessary”.They said: “The health and safety of our guests is always our priority and we have a number of requirements in place to allow our guests with disabilities and additional needs to enjoy our rides.“On some rides, such as Lego Ninjago The Ride, guests are required to walk unaided. This is necessary in the case of guests being evacuated from the ride, as they would be required to walk during the evacuation process.“We are always working to make the resort more accessible and constantly review our processes.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It makes up over 7 per cent of Britain’s GDP, around 9 per cent of our exports and 11 per cent of all tax receipts.The quarterly survey by the Confederation of British Industry and PwC showed that optimism has plunged at the fastest rate since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, triggering panic around the world. Only 5 per cent of firms are now more upbeat about\u0026nbspoverall business in financial services\u0026nbspthan three months ago, while 62 per cent are less optimistic, giving a balance of -56 per cent.Business volumes declined in the past three months at the fastest pace since September 2012. Banks experienced a particularly alarming fall, with the volume of business dropping more rapidly than at any time since March 1991.Meanwhile, the fall in profits across financial services firms was the worst since June 2009, when Britain was still mired in recession. And firms expected profitability to slide further in the next three months.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two tourists pose for pictures in front of Union and EU flags outside the Houses of Parliament in LondonA sheep on London Bridge as Freemen of the City of London took up their historic entitlement to drive sheep over the bridge, which was once London\u0027s only river crossingAn Aldabra giant tortoise is fed watermelon as a treat at the Malvern Autumn Show, at the Three Counties Showground near Malvern in WorcestershireGallery assistants pose with an artwork entitled \u0027Devolved Parliament\u0027 by British artist Banksy, during a press view in London ahead of Sotheby\u0027s contemporary art sale, as part of the Frieze Art FairEngland\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

No ifs, no buts, the government must heed the call to avoid a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit and secure an ambitious deal with our largest trading partner.”Whether or not Britain\u0026nbspleaves\u0026nbspthe EU with or without an agreement, financial services firms said Brexit will have a negative impact on their business over the coming year.A wider survey released on Monday found the same view among UK firms across other sectors, with concerns intensifying sharply since August.In a rare positive finding, the CBI PwC survey revealed that employment across financial services grew at the fastest pace in over a year. Andrew Kail, head of financial services at PwC, said the increase was most probably a response to greater regulation requirements.The poll was conducted between 14 August and 13 September, with 83 firms replying.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is also nervous about threats to the Communist Party’s grip on power, last week warning that the nation would “crumble” if it was not ruled with a firm hand.Created with Sketch.Hong Kong protesters day of grief on communist China anniversary Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hong Kong police fire a water cannon from the central government office at protesters during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters burn a Chinese national flag during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters remove signs celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China during a mass rally in Hong Kong on October 1Cardboard boxes set alight by protesters burn in the streets of Hong Kong during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1An anti-China banner has been placed in a barricade   during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters run after police fire tear gas during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1The rally comes after months of protests on the streets of Hong Kong which began in oppposition to a proposed extradition billThe extradition bill would have allowed the government to extradite people to China if they were facing certain criminal chargesOpposition to the bill stems from the fear that the Chinese government would abuse this power for political or commercial reasonsProtesters soon came to demand greater freedom and universal suffrage under the One Country, Two Systems principleProtesters are wearing black to symbolise opposition to China as they take to the streets in a day of grief while the Chinese state celebrates the 70th anniversary of its communist foundingA protester charges forward holding umbrellas as a mass rally breaks out in violence in Hong Kong on October 1A protester pours water on a tear gas canister fired by police during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1 A protester carries a vandalised Chinese flag through Hong Kong during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1 Protesters carry a banner that denounces the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Hong Kong police fire a water cannon from the central government office at protesters during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters burn a Chinese national flag during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters remove signs celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China during a mass rally in Hong Kong on October 1Cardboard boxes set alight by protesters burn in the streets of Hong Kong during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1An anti-China banner has been placed in a barricade   during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters run after police fire tear gas during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1The rally comes after months of protests on the streets of Hong Kong which began in oppposition to a proposed extradition billThe extradition bill would have allowed the government to extradite people to China if they were facing certain criminal chargesOpposition to the bill stems from the fear that the Chinese government would abuse this power for political or commercial reasonsProtesters soon came to demand greater freedom and universal suffrage under the One Country, Two Systems principleProtesters are wearing black to symbolise opposition to China as they take to the streets in a day of grief while the Chinese state celebrates the 70th anniversary of its communist foundingA protester charges forward holding umbrellas as a mass rally breaks out in violence in Hong Kong on October 1A protester pours water on a tear gas canister fired by police during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1 A protester carries a vandalised Chinese flag through Hong Kong during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1 Protesters carry a banner that denounces the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1The crowd that Mr Xi addressed was carefully vetted, and members of the public trying to access Tiananmen Square on the day were turned away. People with houses lining the parade route were told not to look out of their windows.As the parade gathered in the square, Mr Xi descended to street level and inspected row upon row of gleaming military hardware. Riding in a black limousine he shouted: “Hello comrades”, to replies from the soldiers of “Follow the Party! Fight to win! Forge exemplary conduct!”The event highlighted rapidly developing Chinese weapons technology that foreign analysts say is close to matching the US, Russia and Europe in missiles, drones and some other fields.China’s campaign of military modernisation has alarmed its neighbours in the region, not least because Beijing lays claim to the entirety of the contested South China Sea, as well as independently-run Taiwan and some Japanese islands.One of the most closely-watched weapons unveiled Tuesday was the Dongfeng-17, a nuclear-capable glider that foreign analysts say is designed to manoeuvre at high speed to evade anti-missile defences.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Analysts say it may be able to carry as many as 10 warheads to hit separate targets.\u0026nbspThe People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the world’s biggest military with 2 million men and women in uniform, also had the world’s second-highest military spending at an estimated $250bn\u0026nbsp(£204.2bn) last year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The US, with a force of 1.3 million people, led in spending at $650bn\u0026nbsp(£531.1bn).China has about 280 nuclear warheads, compared with 6,450 for the United States and 6,850 for Russia, according to SIPRI. Beijing says it wants a “minimum credible nuclear deterrent” but won’t be the first to use atomic weapons in a conflict.And Mr Xi also emphasised China’s commitment to “firmly uphold world peace”, saying that the country would pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up.After the military aspect of the parade was complete, 70,000 balloons and 70,000 doves – symbolising peace – were released into the smoggy Beijing air.

It wasn’t to be.I first noticed Demi in , when she appeared in the movie Ghost, as fresh-faced, husky-voiced Molly, mourning the death of her husband Sam, played by Patrick Swayze.She looked adorable, with elfin cropped hair, little make-up and denim dungarees.Everyone wanted to look like this particularly gorgeous “girl next door” and that role catapulted her on to Hollywood’s A-list.Demi made a string of successful but rather questionable movies including Indecent Proposal, Striptease and GI Jane and demanded such high fees she was dubbed “Gimme Moore”, the sort of snarky comment that would never be made about a male actor.Her marriage to Bruce Willis made them the Brad and Angelina of their day, but just like that relationship, theirs too ended in tears and failure.Demi and Bruce went on to declare a truce and he was even at the launch of her new book in a show of support — although you do have to wonderhe had actually read what his ex had written about him.She claims that at the height of her fame he wanted her out of Hollywood so she could be a stay-at-home mum for their children.What strikes me about Demi’s story — from her being raped as a vulnerable  year old, to her complete ­mental breakdown after her marriage to Kutcher fell apart — was what a deeply unhappy le she has led.I honestly don’t know how any young girl would recover from being raped by a disgusting pervert who she claims “bought her” for a few hundred dollars from her alcoholic mother.How on Earth are you supposed to deal with such a horric betrayal from the one person who is supposed to love and protect you from harm It is very sad that Demi said she always felt that she was to blame for the appalling ordeal inflicted upon her by her mother and a man old enough to be her father.I think deep down she’s still that frightened, betrayed little girl who never thinks she is quite good enough.Demi writes movingly about being desperate to have a child with Kutcher.Shortly after their marriage she became pregnant, but tragically the baby died when she was six months pregnant.Again she blamed herself for the loss, and started drinking heavily.The relationship never really recovered. Years later ,just before the couple split, I interviewed Kutcher and it wasn’t a happy experience for all concerned.He wasn’t unpleasant, just deeply uncomfortable and clearly didn’t want to be promoting his latest project, but it was in his contract to so do.Everyone that day received monosyllabic replies and it was no surprise when the news broke shortly afterwards that his marriage to Demi had crumbled and that was when she started to really unravel.Even though on the outside Demi appeared to have everything — fame, enormous wealth, three healthy children and a handsome actor on her arm — inside she was a mass of ­anxiety and insecurities as she lurched from one crisis to the next.She came close to death a year after the split while partying with her oldest daughter Rumer. Demi suffered a seizure after taking drugs and inhaling nitrous oxide.That was a wake-up call for her to seek help and get her act together. Writing the book is apparently all part of the healing process.It won’t have been an easy read for her three grown-up daughters who, unsurprisingly, have apparently had their own issues with either substance abuse or insecurity about their bodies.I honestly do wonderanyone in Hollywood, especially those who find fame because of their good looks and winning smiles, are living happy, ­contented and fulfilled lives.It doesn’t look like it, and it’s deeply sad that a seemingly confident, extremely beautul woman such as Demi should have felt so worthless.All credit to her for coming back from the brink and having the guts to tell her story in her own words.But there is always collateral damage when you decide to be so honest, and I hope she is strong enough to weather the inevitable storms gathering on the horizon.Harry and Meghan brought out a secret weapon during their visit to South Africa and instantly blew away all the negativity and criticism they have experienced this year.With one cute smile and a whole lot of gurgles, baby Archie has completely rehabilitated his parents and shown them in a much happier and far more positive light.It is the first time we have properly seen the four month old and you do wonder why they haven’t shown him to the world before now.Everybody loves a baby, and Archie is a poppet, as well as being Harry’s absolute double.He has a sunny disposition and is obviously adored by his besotted mum and dad. The wee chap looked delighted to be on his first proper outing as a member of the royal firm.And Meghan is in her element. She appeared happy, relaxed and has managed to get her “look” just right.There were no designer frocks nor ostentatious jewellery. Instead it was all sustainable dresses, High Street shoes and lots of recycled outfits.Harry and Meghan have both shone a light on some hugely deserving causes and charities close to their hearts.They work well together, as well as being effective on their own, and it’s refreshing to hear them speak to the media like normal people, instead of the usual dry, formal speeches.It is in places such as Africa that they can both do such a lot of good and build on the pioneering charity work carried out by Harry’s late mum Princess Diana.Meghan telling young South African girls she is a woman of colour who feels like their sister means they can truly relate to her. The words were inspired and from the heart.There are rumours that in the future Harry, Meghan and Archie would spend half the year in southern Africa, and I reckon it’s a good idea.I’ve been lucky enough to visit this incredible part all of the world and it grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.Like Harry, I share a particular love of beautul Botswana, and would be delighted for themthey were lucky enough to set up a home from home there.They would be under much less pressure and scrutiny than here in the UK and able to lead almost normal lives should they so wish.Meanwhile Harry, Meghan – and especially Archie – continue with the charm offensive, breaking down barriers and becoming a force to be reckoned with.Diana would be very proud.Recycle your clothes instead of having wardrobes stuffed with cheap fashion.Stop buying plastic-wrapped fast food and maybe think about turning the bloody lights off when you leave a room.Just a thought . . .I HONESTLY think we are in imminent danger of completely losing our sense of humour and turning into a nation of po-faced bores.I couldn’t believe the reaction I got when I cheekily asked smouldering actor Jason Isaacshe was wearing shorts in an upcoming charity run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and that I would happily run behind him for the view.It was a cheeky remark made to a delightfully naughty man, who I have interviewed many times.I knew he wouldn’t be offended in the least but would laugh heartily, which is exactly what happened. I also thought it was a fun way to promote a terric cause.I was astonished to be labelled “sexist” and “inappropriate”, which is completely OTT for such innocuous remarks.People really need to get things into perspective.Dan has brought us some of the top names in TV, movies and music, covered all the big award ceremonies and always delivers the most entertaining gossip.Here’s to the next decade of scoops, scandals and showbiz shenanigans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How dare you ”Right, well in the immortal words of Samuel L Jackson: “Allow me to retort.”How dare we  No. How dare you sail to America on a carbon fibre yacht that you didn’t build which cost £million, that you didn’t earn, and which has a back-up diesel engine that you didn’t mention.I’m sorry Ms Thunberg, butyou’re going to lay into my generation, you must accept it when I lay into you and yours.What about the pills you take when you have a headache What about the clean water that comes out of your tap  What about the food you can buy at any time of the day and night No -year-old was responsible for any of that.What about the aid missions currently being run in some of the poorest countries of the world, or the drugs that help keep Aids at bay Think about all the movies you’ve enjoyed. Movies made by grown-ups. And all those comedians who’ve made you laugh.And then pause for a moment to consider how soundly you sleep at night, knowing that adults are building and servicing and flying Sweden’s fighter planes. To keep you safe.We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all.So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.And yes, you are spoilt because when you told your mum and dad to stop using planes and give up meat, they didn’t behave like sane parents and ignore you. They actually said, “Yes, dear.” And did.What they should have done is point out that le is tragic.Some people are born bright and some are born stupid.Some are beautul and some are not.Some have rich parents who give them everything but love.Some have poor parents who have nothing to give except love.Now shut up and let them get on with it.This is how the world works. It’s how the world has always worked.And banging your fists on the table won’t change a thing. You’ll learn that when you’ve got a few more years under your belt.I agree with you that the world is heating up. You may even be right that man has something to do with it.And there is no doubt that as deserts eat into currently habitable places in Africa and the Middle East, Europe will face an unimaginable refugee crisis.Something needs to be done about that. So how’s this for an idea. Get back to school as quickly as possible and work hard in your science lectures.Because science is what will solve the problem eventually. Not scowling and having screaming ab-dabs every five minutes.Many thousands of people who you had the temerity to blame this week are trying to do exactly what you want.So be a good girl, shut up and let them get on with it.And no. You cannot stay out past ten. And you cannot go out in a skirt that short.And the best business brains don’t come cheap.SAM Smith, who’s a singer I think, announced recently that “he” doesn’t consider “himself” to be a man or a woman and wants everyone to refer to “him” as “they” in future.They said on Instagram that they have been at war with themselves for . . . oh, I give up.

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They could end up re-shaping the political landscape of this country forever.The Supreme Court’s outlawing of a political decision and the coward Corbyn’s refusal to trigger a general election have created a dangerous Commons stalemate.At the same time voters are powerless as political conventions which are the backbone of our democracy are reshaped before their eyes.Tuesday’s court judgement overruling Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament will have a chilling effect on decision-making at the heart of government.How many future kne-edge rulings made by a PM against the clock could now be quashed by the court What about the signing of treaties  Or the appointment of ministers How about choosing to take military action in retaliation for an attack on Britain You can bet Vladimir Putin is lapping up the prospect of a British Prime Minister having to go cap in hand to a  of judges to askhe can hit back.The Supreme Court has potentially paved the way to a new era of rule by a group of unelected entities. Meanwhile, the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition has shown once again that he has the spine of a jellyfish.Jeremy Corbyn’s actions are those of a man who is scared to face the voters, scared of his own Labour MPs and scared of even being PM.Together with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson he is intent on driving Britain away from the Brexit a majority voted for and into a rigged referendum which nobody deserves.They are also forcing us away from the general election which the country is crying out for and into another EU extension which will only prolong our agony.This week the SNP are leading a plot to ambush Boris with a vote of no confidence while he prepares to address the Tory conference.Perhaps they should consider how Scottish voters would feelthey had won an independence vote only to find it hadn’t been implemented three years later.Our shambling farce has gone on too long.But as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox says even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas.Britain’s voters will get their say eventually.At that moment they will decide one of two very clear futures for this country.Either a resumption of the democratic traditions and institutions at the heart of our society under Boris Johnson.Or a disunited kingdom, riven by the elite interests of lawyers and rival factions, carving up our political landscape between them.It would mean goodbye to the Britain we treasure as a beacon of democracy.And herald the dawn of a chaotic virtual republic under complete enslavement to Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You don’t need to cut these foods out entirely, just to choose red and processed meat as an occasionally rather than every day.“Nearly , people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year, it’s the fourth most common cancer in the UK.Making simple changes to your lestyle, like cutting out red and processed meat, can help stack the odds against bowel cancer.It’s also important to try and be of a healthy weight, cut down on alcohol, exercise regularly and stop smoking, doing all these things can make a real dference.”Tracy Parker, senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Studies like this make it confusing to knowyou should pick up your steak kne or leave it in the drawer.“How much red and processed meat we should be eating has been up for debate for decades, but our advice hasn’t changed.“Most of us could benefit from eating less meat and including more plant-based protein in our diets, such as lentils, nuts and seeds, as well as fruit, vegetables and wholegrains.“These foods make up the traditional Mediterranean diet, which has been linked to a reduced risk of heart and circulatory diseases.” GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The package of measures will “end low pay altogether”, he said.He also told the Tory faithful: “The hard work of the British people really is paying off.“It’s clear it’s the Conservatives who are the real party of labour. We are the workers’ party.”But businesses baulked because of the extra costs for them. And Treasury aides would not deny last night that the moves may hike employers’ wage bills by £billion.In a jam-packed speech, Mr Javid also outlined his plan to roll out new bus networks and bring back scrapped routes. And he:Mr Javid’s low-pay action means minimum-wage workers will be paid p an hour more than they were expecting by . Before his intervention, the wage was forecast to be £. an hour within five years.The move is also a key general election move to try to see off Labour’s promise of raising the minimum wage to £ immediately.A source close to the Chancellor said: “We’ve got a battle with Labour in this space, we need to own it.”An aide to Mr Javid — who is the son of a bus driver who came from humble roots — added: “This is a personal issue for Sajid, he knows what low pay looks like.”Campaigners welcomed the moves. Resolution Foundation think tank boss Torsten Bell said it “will take UK to top of the minimum wage league”.But business chiefs warned it would run the risk of putting small firms out of business.UKHospitality, which represents businesses employing service-industry workers, dubbed it “a double whammy of a further unprecedented cost increase”.And the Federation of Small Businesses’ national chairman Mike Cherry called on Mr Javid to institute “more support to help small employers” meet his ambition.The Chancellor also tore into Labour, delighting the Manchester audience, which included the PM’s special advisor Dominic Cummings.Even he has excelled himself by ­promoting a famously debunked conspiracy theory about Brexit.Remainer Hammond seriously claims Boris Johnson is “backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit”.

Asked whether that would include the DF-, Cai said, “Please wait and see.”No details of the DF- have been released, but the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said it may have the world’s longest range at , kilometres.US nuclear tipped missiles fall a few thousand kilometres short of that.Analysts say the DF-, flying at  times the speed of sound, might be able to reach the US in  minutes with up to  warheads for separate targets.China’s current mainstay missile the Dongfeng- — Dongfeng means “east wind” — has a range of more than , kilometres that puts most of the continental US within reach.Todays carefully coordinated celebrations in China came as a protester was shot in the chest by police in Hong Kong, where violent demonstrations continued against the regime.Tensions remained high today as cops banned rallies in Hong Kong, in fear of chaos on Chinas National Day.Tens of thousands of black-clad protesters marched in multiple pro-democracy rallies, urging Chinas Communist Party topower to the people.In a bid to stop demonstrations, riot police repeatedly fired tear gas in several areas as protesters hurled gasoline bombs, bricks and other objects in their direction.Video footage showed a campaigner - a man struck by a live round - begging for help as he bled on the street.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly . A nation demands it.David Craig: “Jack Grealish does exactly what he says on the tin.”David Croft: “Vettel punched through a gap that wasn’t there.”And Matt Le Tissier: “I love scoring goals but equally almost liked creating goals as much.”BBC’S latest Far East celebrity travelogue really should’ve been called Sue Perkins Condescends To Meet Some Foreigners.But it wasn’t. They settled instead on Japan With Sue Perkins, who went “in search of the country’s soul” by dressing up as a few cultural stereotypes and probably sending children to bed with nightmares in her geisha girl outfit.If WE did that, of course, “cultural appropriation” would be the least of the accusations made against us. But it seems to be all right here, I think, ’cos Sue’s a middle-class Cambridge graduate who reads the .No matter where she travels, Sue also remains ever-vigilant for the slightest hint of sexism and clearly thought she was guaranteed plenty of that at a government-sponsored speed-dating night, along with lots of other stuff tosspots like to describe as “problematic”.Soyou want to see irony squared, watch the moment towards the end of episode two when Sue grandly tells a whole room of uncomprehending dorks: “Formality permeates every part of Japanese culture. Everything’s driven by boundaries, rules and regulations. They’ve lost the fundamentals.”And then think: “Yeah, what this country really needs is a naked dating show where contestants are judged on the state of their genitals, hosted by Sue Perkins’ missus.”That’ll drag ’em into the st Century.The consistently brilliant Good Morning Britain finding the only Piers Morgan impersonator in Japan who wasn’t wearing a wrestling nappy.Richard Madeley’s cameo in The Circle.Celebrity MasterChef contestant Joey Essex inventing the “stirotto” , which looked about as appetising as a pandopsy .And Strictly’s Mike Bushell attempting the American smooth, with Katya Jones, to that all-time Glen Campbell classic Like A Blind Stoned Cowboy.AMERICAN trailer-trash comedian Vicki Barbolak accidentally locked herself in a pink caravan at the start of her routine on Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions. Then someone from production let her out and the problems really started.Two minutes into her act, Vicki came to a grinding halt and stuttered: “I . . . I . . . I changed everything I was going to do.” And decided to shove any good material down the caravan’s chemical toilet A horribly awkward moment for everyone, though not the first sign the booking process had seriously maled with this episode.That was the previous act – Gennady Tkachenko-Papizh, from Kazakhstan, whose “ceremony of sound” went where your iPhone alarm fears to tread, making the sort of random animal noises usually accompanied by the caption “footage courtesy of PETA”.British politeness rescued him from the silence that should have followed – along with David Walliams, who said: “People are not going to forget the name . . . sorry, I’ve forgotten your name.”What I definitely will remember about Saturday’s episode, though, is the timely question Simon Cowell posed to the act that followed Gennady and Vicki, Twist  Pulse: “The people who didn’t want to compete again. You know why they didn’t want to compete again ”The Circle, James “Sammie”: “I’m funny, charming and handsome. And I’m popular.”Oh, come now.

Forcing them to carry crack cocaine and heroin across rural and coastal communities.“Threatening them into carrying guns and knives as ‘protection’. Manipulating them into killing innocent people.“Faced with this new and growing danger, our police will know that I will back them to get this under control.And today I am announcing a £ million package to roll up county lines drugs gangs.To stop them terrorising our towns and villages and exploiting our children.“And a new £ million Safer Streets fund for new security measures for Britain’s worst crime spots.“And as well as giving the police the kit and powers they need, we must do more to recognise their commitment, their bravery, and their professionalism.Ms Patel also used her speech to take a swipe at Labour boss Jeremy Corbyn and shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott.She claimed Labour would see Britain’s streets less safe and accused Labour of “trusting our foes rather than our friends”.The Home Secretary said: “Of course, there will be only two dissenting voices.“Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn.“Because the choice isn’t just who the people want to be our next Prime Minister.“It’s also about who the people want to be their next Home Secretary.“Do we really want a Labour Home Secretary who would leave our communities and our country less safe “A Labour Party who won’t even attempt to take back control of our borders.“Because they want to surrender our border control and extend free movement.“And on policing The Labour Party would stop the police from doing their job.“And when it comes to our brilliant intelligence agencies, well – what can I say “The Labour Party trust our foes more than our friends.”Ms Patels speech comes after Justice Secretary Robert Buckland unveiled plans to axe automatic early release for serious violent criminals and sexual offenders.Instead of being let out half way through their sentence, they will now have to spend at least two-thirds of their term behind bars.It means rapists will face up to two more years in jail.Mr Buckland said: “We owe it to the victims.”The pledge is the latest bid to toughen up the Tories’ reputation on law and order following a blood curdling surge in kne attacks.Boris Johnson has vowed to hire , more police officers and rip up sentencing rules to ensure child killers get “le” terms.Currently, almost all serious violent and sexual offenders are automatically released half way through their prison term under changes brought in by Labour in .The new proposals mean a rapist sentenced to  years will have to serve . years instead of .It wouldn’t cover murder as killers have to serve their whole tarf before going in front of the Parole Board."},{"url":null,"title":"huge delivery champagne arrives tory","story":"NewsHuge delivery of Champagne arrives at Tory conference as Boris Johnsons pals discuss povertyDozens of bottles of Pol Roger arrived in Manchester as MPs gathered to discuss homelessness and povertyShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsA pallet of bubbly arrived at the conference this morning \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Sir Desmond boasted last week he had blacked up as Godfather of Soul James Brown, it was fun, he was not sorry, and the only reason he wouldnapost do it again is because it was hard to wash off. After a photo was sent to the Daily , Sir Desmond confirmed the woman in the picture was his we - and could not deny he was the man. Confronted at the Tory conference, the former foreign aid minister told the paper: It is definitely my we. What does this add to what I have already said  Nothing.”  Askedthe man was him, the New Forest West MP told the : “It might be, is all I can say. I can’t deny it. I don’t know the provenance of this photograph. It was years ago.” Sir Desmond Swayne was condemned by Labour over the astonishing brag after Canadaaposs Prime Minister was exposed using dark make-up at least twice at fancy dress parties in his youth. Justin Trudeau apologised and admitted white privilege had blinded him to the fact wearing blackface was racist. Yet former International Development minister Sir Desmond defended the practice as an entirely acceptable bit of fun. The -year-old MP for New Forest West, handed a knighthood by David Cameron in , said he blacked up as Godfather of Soul James Brown at a Blues Brothers party and had no intention of apologising. He added the only reason he would not put on blackface again is because you have to go to some trouble to get it off.

Labour MP David Lammy said: For those who have been victims of racism, there arenapost words for how grim it is that Tory MP Desmond Swayne refuses to apologise for blacking up.

The Loose Women star and the former Sky News paper reviewer revealed themselves at their most vulnerable in a bid to demonstrate to others suffering in silence that it really is OK not to be OK. Soundbites and campaigning on the issue are one thing. It is quite another to reveal the naked truth about just how weakened, dismantled and utterly defeated you are left feeling on a day to day basis. “How I describe it is the colour goes out of my le and people I am around that I love being with I don’t want to be around,” said Welch. Fty-year-old comedian Royce – a former warm-up man for The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent – is fighting to overcome alcohol addiction. He suffered a brain aneurysm when drunk and at one time attempted suicide. “My name is Ian and I’m an alcoholic…holding my hands up… for help. There I said it and own it,” he posted on Twitter.

Pilates instructor Alejandra Labastida-Shapiro, , shuns processed products and sugar in favour of mainly raw and organic food. Combined with an exercise regime, the mother-of-three who lives in Chicago in Illinois, says the flirtatious advances she receives from men and being mistaken for her daughteraposs sister prove itaposs working. Alejandra began her journey to live a healthy lestyle at the age of  when her father would encourage her to run with him.    Growing up with healthy parents, who would use natural remedies and medicinal herbs to avoid future sicknesses and injuries, they educated Alejandra about the world of fitness and diets. While she initially chose this lestyle for vanity reasons, as she grew older, she began to re-sht her focus to improve her health. In , Alejandra, who is mum to Roberto, , Alejandra, , and -year-old Maurici, was introduced to Pilates through a friend, which she fell in love with. Her youthful figure has prompted many advances from men who give her compliments on her appearance and has even received flowers from a secret admirer.  My dad introduced me to exercise when I was a little girl. From a very young age I was aware of the power of natural living, Alejandra said. My parents used medicinal herbs, traditional remedies or homeopathy most of the time to cure our early years sicknesses and injuries. I always was involved in sports and believe our body is the temple where our soul resides, so I had been for years studying and practising better and more effective ways to reach that goal. My lestyle always had been healthy but has been improving by knowledge and experience and also by observation of my clientsapos results.  I teach with my knowledge and by example that the statement aposage is just a numberapos is trueyou have the right care in your lestyle and with positive thoughts. I keep a balance in my active training and recovery time. Before I used to think by doing cardio was more than enough to keep my body healthy, but injuries and studying dferent formats taught me that our muscles have dferent abilities and motions. There is not a specic fitness format that can cover all of them. The same format can develop overuse injuries or fractures. I also learned how with age it was important to develop our muscles to prevent osteoporosis and keep hormonal balance by keeping active workouts with recovery workouts.  Good posture and mobility play an important part of our energy level and ability to rid us of toxins in the body. Balance in your nutrients is a very important part of overall, but with a positive mind, all of these components combine to create a healthy body. I can manage better normal stress in le and use my energy to do more things that I need to do, but also what I love to do. I can still do activities that most people of my age canapost and enjoy le doing things with my loved ones. I have to admit that today I need to take care more about what to eat than before, otherwise I can gain weight easier.  You are what you eat, so I avoid the most that I can processed food and sugar. Mostly I eat raw and organic and avoid putting chemicals in my body. I try to avoid medication. I prefer to use herbs, natural remedies or homeopathy than any other medication. Our bodies have amazing power to heal. Alejandra, who also has four grandchildren says that her lestyle has helped her keep up with them and join in fun activities. Since becoming a Pilates instructor, she has received many compliments on her appearance and people often mistake her for being her daughteraposs sister.  I feel healthier in general and smarter than I did in my twenties and thirties. Iaposve even learned to stay away from toxic people or situations that drain my energy. When you do that, the right people appear in your le, she said.Men are really surprised when they see me. Whenever I teach classes or Iaposm in dferent places, guys will give me compliments. Even on social media, I receive complements about how I look on Instagram .A couple of times Iaposve received flowers from strangers Iaposm married so I right away say my status. Many times, people think my daughter and I are sisters. Start changing one bad habit for a good one at time. If for some reason you fall, be nice with you. Start over and be more aware.

The options are endless. You could keep it sweet and simple and pop the question at home, you could hide the ring in a cake at a fancy restaurant or go all-out and organise a flash mob. The biggest problem is, much like Eminem, you usually only get one shot. Dad-of-two Colton Vaters found a way around this by proposing to his girlfriend more than  times behind her back.    Colton, from Canada, had the ring but no idea as to how he was going to ask Danielle Campbell to be his we. He wanted it to be romantic and funny, but without making the whole thing seem like a joke. He also wanted to capture the big moment on record. It wasnapost going to be easy.   Then he stumbled on the story of Edi Okoro, who took photos of his fiancée and the ring at the same time without her knowing in more and more daring scenarios. Game on, said Colton in a post which quickly went viral on Facebook .I started taking the ring with me everywhere I went, and taking as many photos as I could without her noticing.    I also left the ring in ious spots throughout the house for dferent periods of time. He attached it to her handbag, put it in their mailbox, held the ring up as they walked through a supermarket and even put in her hand as she slept in bed. Some of the photos are enough to make us nervous but Coltonaposs plan was simple -he was ever caught, he would propose there and then.    Despite the brazen photoshoots, his masterplan went undetected and came to an end with a beautul formal engagement as he finally got down on one knee in front of his new fiancée. It all went to plan and I would highly recommend this to anyone planning on asking the big question in the future, he added.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position.

Borders Railway.And doubts have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main Line.\"Diesel hauled trains not in a hurry already go via Dumfries so having another ersionary alternative route would not add

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over. This illustrates that birdwatching at this time of year can be exciting.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

However, the local authority has stressed it is aiming to ldquoenhance parking provision in such a way that the number of available spaces in Haddington is increased beyond current levels and that better use is made of each space.Currently, Haddington town centre is home to more than  spaces.The long-stay car park at Tesco has  spaces, which includes two disabled and car club spaces and four public electric charge spaces.On the opposite side of Court Street, the car park at East Lothian Councilrsquos headquarters, John Muir House, has  spaces.The majority of those ndash  ndash are long stay but the car park is reserved for ldquocouncil-based activities between am and pm throughout the week and is only available to the general public at the weekend and outwith those times.Proposals suggest a revamp of High Street, which has  spaces Market Street, which has  spaces Hardgate, which has four spaces and Court Street, which can accommodate  cars.Meanwhile,  town centre residents have parking permits, which enable them to park in any of the restricted -minute maximum parking areas for any duration.East Lothian Council has not revealed the number of spaces ndash or the site ndash for any proposed car park at Whittingehame Drive, although it has been suggested as having between  and  spaces.Liz McDougall, chairwoman of the Nungate Gala committee, told the Courier that the council had not been in touch about the proposals.She was concerned about the impact it could have on their gala activities.

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

The latest issue involves the upgrading of the telephone appointment system where non-urgent appointments are not available until October .ldquoThe major issue is actually getting an appointment within a reasonable period. We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area. However, it must be stressed thata patient needs to see a healthcare professional urgently, then they will do.ldquoWe appreciate that change in the way services are provided can take a period of time to settle in however, we know from patient feedback that we are getting it right, and this is reflected by the fact that we have received complaints from only . per cent of patients this year.ldquoWe know that the signicant majority of our patients have a positive experience of healthcare through Riverside."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-full-praise-ridge-visit","story":"Aileen Campbell MSP, cabinet secretary for communities and local government, paid a visit to the town.She was met by staff and volunteers from The Ridge, who spoke about their work at the Backlands Garden site.Volunteers also spoke about how The Ridge and its services had impacted on their lives.Ms Campbell was also impressed by the work being carried out by the Ridge Foundations team, who are currently restoring the Black Bull Close buildings that sit at the head of the gardens.Until recently, the buildings had lain in ruins, in real danger of being lost forever.While under restoration and looking forward to a more useful future, the buildings now act as a training environment for the Ridge Foundations trainees and apprentices, as they learn and hone their new skills in masonry and joinery.The MSP said: ldquoVisiting The Ridge gave me an insight into the wide range of projects and support they provide, including the Backlands site, the Hungry Hatch Cafe and the exciting restoration work at Black Bull Close.ldquoThese projects provide great food, green spaces to enjoy and improve Dunbar as a place to live and visit.ldquoThis innovative enterprise also provides local people with opportunities for training, employment and volunteering and helps improve health and wellbeing.ldquoThe success of The Ridge is a testament to the dedication of staff and volunteers, transforming peoplersquos lives and physically regenerating the heart of Dunbar.A spokeswoman for The Ridge was ldquothrilled to welcome the politician.She added: ldquoAs an organisation, we are deeply embedded within the community and believe passionately that everyone has a really valuable contribution to make.ldquoWe are committed to providing opportunities for people to overcome barriers to achieving their full potential.ldquoMs Campbell could see and understood how the many Ridge offerings provide a holistic environment for those more vulnerable members of our community to thrive."},{"url":null,"title":"project-restoring-historic-tranent-shopfront-former-glory","story":"The Buttercup Dairy company was founded by Edinburgh mogul Andrew Ewing, with the first branch opening in  in Kirkcaldy, and it soon became common all over Scotlandrsquos central belt.The company was famous for its distinctive and extravagant shop fronts and it lasted for  years before its final shop closed down in .Tranentrsquos branch of this iconic dairy was at - High Street, and the intact shop front was discovered by local beauticians Simply Smooth.A grant was given by Regenerate Tranent to repair and restore it to its former glory.Gareth Jones, the architect managing the project, presented a social media video on the progress made by the team.He said that there was some damage from boarding up the shop front for so many years, indicating the drill holes in the tiles however, most of the tile work has survived and the plan is to restore, rather than replace, as much as possible.It is not just the aesthetics that the team will be dealing with ndash work on the roof and chimney will ensure the building is weather proof.Lucy Schofield, Tranent regeneration scheme officer, said: ldquoWersquore really excited and happy with the repair works.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10459949.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-scotlands-best-seafood-experiences","story":"The Seafood Ristorante, St AndrewsLocated in an iconic lsquoglass boxrsquo, the Seafood Ristorante relaunched in March  and isnow one of Scotlandrsquos premium dining venues.

It is dficult to see why. A time limit on the interview might have been part of the deal with Downing Street, but the beauty of a live programme is that things can changeneed be. Marrs interview with Boris Johnson was just reaching a critical juncture when the show segued to a pre-recorded interview with Dame Helen Mirren about Catherine the Great .Granted, viewers might have been looking forward to hearing from Dame Helen, but the segment could have been included in a longer version of the programme placed on iPlayer. Yes, the PMrsquos minders would likely have moanedthe interview overran, and it is not quite cricket to go back on an arrangement, yet as we are being constantly told, we are living in extraordinary times.As for the interview with Angela Rayner, Shadow Education Secretary, it could be justied by way of reaction to the Johnson interview. Couple of questions, job done. But we had her response, plus a rehash of last weekrsquos Labour conference story about public schools in England, and yet more speculation on what might happen next on Brexit.Was this a case of the BBC playing it safe when a commercial broadcaster might have gone for it with the Johnson interview and had the arguments later : PM says he acted with proprietyJust as these are unusual times, so Mr Johnson is an exceptional interviewee. That was made plain once more during his encounter with Marr. It was asthe BBC man was equipped with a water pistol, delivering questions in short, sharp, well-aimed bursts, and Mr Johnson was countering with one of those water cannons he bought as London Mayor and was banned from using by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. ldquoWhoosh! went a torrent of metaphor and hyperbole in Marrrsquos direction.It is a dficult style to combat. Interviewing Mr Johnson on the Today programme, Mishal Husain resorted to telling him to ldquoPlease stop talking, which he laughed at and carried on. Eddie Mair managed to get further than most by being icily forensic and not allowing himself to be distracted by the Johnson bluster. Marr did a heroic job of hauling the PM back to the topic on the many occasions he tried to break free, but even this was not enough to halt the tide of verbosity.The most newsworthy moment came towards the end of the encounter when talk turned to Mr Johnsonrsquos friendship with American businesswoman, Jenner Arcuri. The subject had been raised during the paper review. ldquoA lot of people are wonderingwe are going to talk about the Jenner Arcuri affair, said Marr during the item. ldquoYes, we are. They had to, given it was the splash in the Sunday Times. Plus, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had criticised the show for not tackling a Minister about the story last week, when it broke.: Facing court again over extensionThis time, Marr asked several times whether Mr Johnson, as London mayor, had declared any links to Ms Arcuri given her business was in receipt of public money and she had gone on publicly funded trade missions. ldquoThere was no interest to declare, said the PM.Over on Ridge on Sunday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, adopted a similar, nothing to see here, approach to the Arcuri story, saying that everything went through the proper processes.Next up was Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose party had taken out a double page ad in a Sunday newspaper proposing an electoral pact with the Conservatives as a way to give Mr Johnson ldquoa big, workable majority. The PM later brushed aside the offer.Host Sophy Ridge tackled Mr Farage on a recent speech in which he said ldquowersquoll take the kne to overpaid pen pushers in Whitehall who had tried to frustrate Brexit. ldquoIt would have been better to say axe, he conceded, claiming such language was are more in keeping with political tradition.If Mr Farage was now the vocabulary police to Mr Hancockrsquos traffic cop, it has hard to know what role Jackson Carlaw was playing on Sunday Politics Scotland. In the face of questioning by host Gordon Brewer, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives was like the office temp who had unwisely picked up a ringing phone as he was passing. No, he had not been consulted by London over new EU proposals. Nor was he going to be drawn on whether the PM would have to resignhe did not obey the law and seek a Brexit extension, as one of his own MSPs, Adam Tomkins, insisted earlier this month. Nothing had anything to do with Mr Carlaw, but he would take a message and make sure the right person received it once they ed from lunch.: Hospital building programme highlightedAt least he did not add more intemperate words and heat to what had been a torrid week. On Marr, Helen Mirren said Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, once advised that it was best to praise in a loud voice and scold in a whisper. How wise. It was worth having the grand dame on after all."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-tories-back-spring-election-capitalise-snp-turmoil-following-salmond-trial","story":"The plea to the Prime Minister came as the partyrsquos annual conference in Manchester heard another major spending announcement: a plan to raise the national living wage to pound. an hour by  unveiled by Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, as he sought to move the conference spotlight away from allegations surrounding Mr Johnsons private le.The further sign that an election is on its way has prompted Scottish Tory MPs to urge the PM to rule out a December poll and wait until next year to go to the country, preferably in the spring.:Opposition parties reject SNPs bid for snap no-confidence vote as rt remainsSome party insiders argue that, apart from avoiding the effects of a bad winter in Scotland, holding an election in March  could bring electoral benefits for the Conservatives in their battle with Nicola Sturgeonrsquos SNP following the high-profile Salmond court case.One senior Scottish Tory source told The Herald: ldquoIrrespective of the outcome of the trial, the Nationalists will be in turmoil.In his set-piece speech, Mr Javid told conference that his \"ambitious\" proposal - which as well as a rise in the amount of the living wage would also see the age threshold lowered to cover all workers aged over  - would give four million people a pay rise.He explained he wanted the national living wage to be raised to match two-thirds of median earnings, which would represent a p hourly increase in .\"Over the next five years, we will make the UK one of the first major economies in the world to end low pay altogether,\" declared the Chancellor.But Mr Javid said the Government wanted to reward the hard work of millennials and bring down the age threshold to cover all workers over .But John McDonnell, his Labour Shadow, dismissed the announcement, saying: ldquoThis pathetic attempt at catch-up by the Conservatives will fool nobody.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI Director-General, said: ldquoBusiness shares the Chancellors ambition to end low pay.

Word had reached the highest level that there was \"a person with views\" in S. As I walked down a pitch black, -metre-long corridor, I remained steadfastly sure that my wide-ranging research , and in-depth questioningwould see me through this momentary hiccup in creating this seemingly seditious pamphlet .But, in the four minutes it took for the red traffic light at the end of the tunnel of doom, to turn to green, and the Heidiersquos voice to boom ldquoCome!, I wobbled. Yes itrsquos true! I was indeed a dirty socialist interloper sent from a s housing estate state primary school to this small, all-girl, private school to undermine it and ultimately bring about its collapse.When it came to thinking about schools for my own children, surprisingly the simplicity of my survey did not help. I talked to other parents. One friend, who I visited on a sunny April morning at her and her husbandrsquos six-bedroom house, complete with a Porsche  gleaming in the driveway, told me that they were sending their children to the local state school because they felt school was not just about academics.ldquoItrsquos about learning le lessons, coming across a range of people, problems and lsquostuffrsquo so that real le doesnrsquot come as a massive surprise.But then there was another friend of mine in Perth who is an NHS worker. She stridently told me she would rather starve than not have sent her son to private school for the last  years. She herself had been a quiet child who had struggled in a large state primary school and fell behind, before being moved to our private school.ldquoThere were months mum couldnrsquot pay, but the school helped out. Yes, I was at school with girls who had race horses in the front garden, but I didnrsquot feel any dferent.She found it hard to catch up with her reading and writing. ldquoI didnrsquot want that for my son, who was quite introverted as well. It had been exceptionally hard for her to pay the fees for his school. She paused before adding ldquoRemember all those times I couldnrsquot come to Glasgow to see you girls  Well that was because I didnrsquot have the money to put petrol in the car.I could see a little of what my friend was so passionate about: I really admired the seemingly over-arching confidence of the girls I had been at school with. I craved that confidence for my children. We were a purposeful, articulate and loyal bunch. We stretched our wings in the sciences, creative writing and Latin.We were surprisingly erse too - from the children of the inherited rich to the daughters of the just-recently-got rich. From the off-spring of immigrants whorsquod arrived with a fiver in their pockets to the few girls who faced abuse walking through some of Glasgowrsquos poorer areas to get to the school, we were quite a motley crew.As a Muslim, I was proud to inform my parents that my best friends were a Jew and a Christian. We confidently asserted ourselves, and expressed our ideas freely, perhaps without fear of what any boys in the class might think of us. Most,not all, of us assumed we would go to university or college and then onto work.But I often wonderedour confidence was a bit like our school unorm, and indeed our accents - something we put on, to homogenise us, to make us a type, maybe to cover up or compensate for any wee shortcomings we might have had.We were also utterly terried of the kids from the local state school. They sat on a wall nonchalantly eating chips as we walked by, but we actually thought they wanted to kill us - a perfect example of how a lack of contact, breeds fear. It floors me to think that,  years later, a close friend and colleague, Kate, who I cannot even contemplate starting a work project without, was one of those chip-eating lsquoterrorsrsquo.I knew that sort of insularity and lack of, as I saw it, iniduality was not what I wanted for my own children.Ultimately, both had six years at state school, having encountered young people from a wide spectrum of backgrounds and abilities, accents and sensibilities.I watch them in their workplaces interact with customers with an ease I could have only dreamt of. They describe nights out that involve skillful de-escalations of potentially dficult situations with groups of other young men in the street.They are quietly confident but always attuned to the group dynamic. Most importantly I value their iniduality, and their determination to go against the flow or fashion. They may not have particular loyalties to their old school tie, but perhaps thats not a bad thing."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-offer-new-brexit-plan-brussels","story":"The UK will offer Brussels a revised Brexit deal by the end of the week as Prime Minister Boris Johnson ramps up efforts to strike an agreement.It is understood the legal text of a Brexit plan will be sent to Brussels after the Tory conference concludes on Wednesday.The move comes as Irish broadcaster RTE reported the UK had put forward the idea ofcustom clearance centres being set up five to ten miles either side of the Irish border.:Opposition leaders plot to stop Boris Johnsons no-deal Brexit planHowever, Government sources distanced themselves from parts of the reports.The reported plans by the British Government to create customs posts along both sides of the Irish border to replace the backstop were dismissed by Irish deputy premier Simon Coveney.The idea for the customs posts are contained in the so-called lsquonon-papersrsquo submitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions.Mr Coveney poured cold water on the plans, saying Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ldquodeserves better.:Scottish court bid to ensure Boris Johnson \"obeys law\" over Brexit to startHe tweeted: ldquoNon-Paper  Non-Starter.

Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"food waste really can power cars like in the 1980s back to the future movies","story":"Just as Marty McFly and the Doc discovered in Back to the Future, our food waste can be transformed into a sustainable fuel to power future energy needs.So environmental organisation Zero Waste Scotland is using this year’s Recycle Weekto raise awareness of the potential energy that can be captured by simply placing peelings, egg shells, tea bags and any uneaten produce in household food recycling caddies.The time travelling DeLorean used in the classic s movies was modied to run on food waste – and the technology now exists to use it today to power vehicles, heat our homes and grow more food.Estimates from Zero Waste Scotland reveal that , tonnes of global warming CO equivalent gas would be saved from entering the environmenteveryone in Scotland with access to a food caddy recycled their tea bags. Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The guiding minds of this conspiracy were abroad. --\"Images of cash, jewellery and tools found during the West Midlands Police inquiry into a burglary gang directed from Romania to target high-end homes in the West Midlands.--Stoian and Zaharia, both aged , Molocia, , Stoean, , and -year-old Spiru will now face a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing after being jailed.Zaharia, who admitted conspiracy to commit burglary in relation to eight offences, was jailed for eight years after Judge Murray Creed described him as being at the ldquohead of the pyramid for the gang in the UK.Spiru, who was found guilty of money laundering after being accused of selling jewellery and disposing of cash, was jailed for four-and-a-half years.The remaining defendants all admitted conspiracy to burgle.Married father-of-two Stoian, of Smethwick, West Midlands, took part in three burglaries of unoccupied homes over a period of ten days while under pressure from other gang members. He was handed a four-year custodial term.Molocia, also living in Smethwick, participated in ten break-ins and was jailed for six years and four months.Stoean, who was involved in two offences of burglary committed with others, received a four-year sentence.Passing sentence, Judge Murray Creed said of the conspiracy: ldquoIt had an international perspective ndash the court has heard about trips to Romania but there was also money laundering which involved countries as far apart as India and Spain.ldquoThe lestyle that you Zaharia and your partner Spiru followed could be seen in the pictures on Instagram and where ndash the shoes filled with money in somebodyrsquos bedroom.Adding that the gang had caused untold misery, Judge Creed said it was up to other agencies to decide whether deportation proceedings would follow the prison terms.Commenting after the sentencing, West Midlands Police Sergeant Sandy Thompson, who helped to lead the investigation, said: ldquoThis was a challenging investigation as none of the five were on the radar of law enforcement in the UK until Zaharia was arrested in autumn . That helped us link him to several burglaries and begin to understand the extent of the burglary conspiracy and the others involved.ldquoWe suspect other people from Romania were also involved in the plot and we are working with the Romania authorities in a bid to bring others to justice.Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

He’s a fine actor, obviously, but we also have a couple of things in common. We share the same dentist, or at least shared, back in boyhood in Edinburgh, when surgeries were grim places, waiting-rooms contained not a single dog-eared copy of the Beano, and memories of the brown rubber mask jammed over your mouth just before the knockout gas took effect could still evoke a shudder half a century later. We were struggling to remember his name until I mentioned the mask. “That was it – Mr Brown,” said Stott, holding his jaw in mock pain. “And he just loved pulling teeth.”The other thing we have in common is that we’ve both pretended to follow the rival capital football team from the one we support – me for a book and Stott to play Ian Rankin’s detective John Rebus on TV. Rankin wrote the character as a Hibs fan and Stott, a follower of Hearts, has just had to lump it and wear the scarf. Writer’s prerogative and all that.But this hasn’t stopped Stott wondering about Rebus’ politics. Indeed he’s done more than wonder, firing off a letter to Nicola Sturgeon insisting that the grumpy gumshoe is an indyreffer and not the No voter the author claims.: Why Rebus said sorry for wearing a Hibs scarf – Steve CardownieFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThis has been boiled up into a row. A “public war of words”, according to the report I read, with Stott apparently “incensed” by Rankin making the crabbit cop wear a metaphorical Unionist bunnet when almost everything about him points in the other direction.What a hoot. I don’t think anyone is incensed and am sure all the participants will be having a laugh about this, especially Stott, who some have felt the need to inform that Rebus isn’t actually a real person, that writers make stuff up, and that characters belong to them and not actors.You’re a luvvie!Er, I think he will know all of this. And I reckon the nub of the issue here is in the report’s headline which labels Stott a “luvvie”. You see, actors aren’t supposed to have views about anything beyond the film play telly programme they’re promoting. They’re not supposed to engage with the world. If they try and do this they’re ridiculed.That was just a performance! You read something right-on in theand you memorised it! You’re a bleeding-heart, look-at-me-I’m-wonderful, feel-the-warmth-of-my-sincerity, jump-on-any-cause, over-emoting git! You’re a luvvie!Am I about to say something in defence of Actors With Opinions  I think I might be. Goodness knows I’ve met plenty without. In a previous le I interviewed actors all the time. They’d talk about “the work” and nothing . They’d talk about their characters asthey were real people. They’d analyse their characters’ motivations like they were Sigmund bloody Freud. Then, exhausted and appalled and desperate to end this charade, I’d ask the plaintive final question that I knew to be hopeless: “So, what do you do when you’re not acting ” Always the reply would be: “Oh, I love going to the theatre and the cinema.” In other words, you watch other actors act. In other words, you’re just as insecure and neurotic as the rest, and just as much of an empty vessel as well.: Why Scotland must move on from independence referendum Sturgeon cannot call – Brian Wilson: Scottish independence: Scottish Tories rule out supporting ‘supermajority’ in second referendumSo when actors attempt to fill the vessel with notions, ideas, a bit of themselves, something which angers inspires them, anything apart from the bland pfle which forms the basis of most celebrity interviews, what do we do  We make fun of them.The actor knows he’s his own worst enemy. Martin Freeman, star of The Office, Sherlock and currently A Confession, is extremely nervous about members of his profession getting political. “It’s deeply annoying to have someone like me, who doesn’t know everything, bang on,” he says. “Actors can be pompous and we can overestimate our importance.”And Katherine Parkinson from The IT Crowd and right now Defending the Guilty says: “Actors who aren’t that informed going on about their politics make me cringe. It’s very easy to call yourself a feminist and often men that might say it the loudest are the first to stick their hand on someone who’s not their girlfriend’s knee.”Reagan dismissed genuine heroismSo what’s worse: an actor who talks about politics but is a groper ... or a prime minister, women on either side of him at lunch, who’s dubbed “the double thigh-squeezer”. Almost certainly the latter, but the actor who puts himself out there politically should be allowed to make the odd mistake and drop the occasional clanger. Yes, what they say can make them seem self-important and sanctimonious but surely that’s down to delivery they’re more accomplished at getting up and speaking than you or me .I’ve laughed at actors plenty. My favourite story about political actors concerns Ronald Reagan when he was trying to win a second term as US President and Democrat rival John Glenn, the former astronaut, received a boost in the polls from the film The Right Stuff about the true le adventures of the Mercury Seven rocketmen. Reagan dismissed Glenn as “just a celluloid hero” until it was pointed out to him that the latter had carried out all the daring portrayed in the movie. Reagan on the other hand had not actually shot a bad guy, quelled a ‘Red Indian’ uprising, saved the day.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us. To provide this type of sports provision for the children, for the community.“It is important to stress that we want the community to be part of the management process of this project and we have extended several invitations for residents to join the Glassmullin Management Committee. The vision has always been co-ownership of this project and that remains as such.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"jobs saved at harland and wolff as bid for shipyard accepted","story":"A financial bid for Harland and Wolff shipyard has been accepted following a nine-week occupation by its staff.The site has been bought for a total of £ million by InfraStrata, a London-based energy firm.

Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had “defied the cynics”.SDLP Councillor Brian Heading welcomed news that a buyer had been found.Cllr Heading spearheaded efforts to bring together a coalition of public agencies to secure the shipyard after it fell into administration.“At last the shipyard workers have some positive news. They have fought tooth and nail to defend their livelihoods but also to secure one of Belfast’s most iconic industries. They deserve immense credit for their work over the last number of months,” he said.“What’s needed now is an economic strategy for the shipyard that will allow the site to grow and prosper. We have a real opportunity to create a green energy hub on the site, forging ahead with the assembly and manufacture of cutting edge wind technology.

Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

Stoian and Zaharia, both aged , Molocia, , Stoean, , and -year-old Spiru will now face a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing after being jailed.Zaharia, who admitted conspiracy to commit burglary in relation to eight offences, was jailed for eight years after Judge Murray Creed described him as being at the “head of the pyramid” for the gang in the UK.Spiru, who was found guilty of money laundering after being accused of selling jewellery and disposing of cash, was jailed for four-and-a-half years.The remaining defendants all admitted conspiracy to burgle.Married father-of-two Stoian, of Smethwick, West Midlands, took part in three burglaries of unoccupied homes over a period of ten days while under pressure from other gang members. He was handed a four-year custodial term.Molocia, also living in Smethwick, participated in ten break-ins and was jailed for six years and four months.Stoean, who was involved in two offences of burglary committed with others, received a four-year sentence.Passing sentence, Judge Murray Creed said of the conspiracy: “It had an international perspective – the court has heard about trips to Romania but there was also money laundering which involved countries as far apart as India and Spain.“The lestyle that you Zaharia and your partner Spiru followed could be seen in the pictures on Instagram and where – the shoes filled with money in somebody’s bedroom.”Adding that the gang had caused untold misery, Judge Creed said it was up to other agencies to decide whether deportation proceedings would follow the prison terms.Commenting after the sentencing, West Midlands Police Sergeant Sandy Thompson, who helped to lead the investigation, said: “This was a challenging investigation as none of the five were on the radar of law enforcement in the UK until Zaharia was arrested in autumn . That helped us link him to several burglaries and begin to understand the extent of the burglary conspiracy and the others involved.“We suspect other people from Romania were also involved in the plot and we are working with the Romania authorities in a bid to bring others to justice.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mackintosh property passes water pistol test","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can.

That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: DCSDC Health and Community Committee and UNISON Community Branch Activists."},{"url":null,"title":"newtown volunteers working around clock look kittens","story":"There are more kittens to be adopted in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection is looking for people to adopt kittens.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensMore kittens are in need of adoption in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensOne of the kittens up for adoption Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection staff are hoping to see more kittens adopted.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensCats protection logo.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"newtown youngsters strike climate change","story":"Climate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Pictured left to right, Kylie DaviesSophie WeaverRuby White, Lyssie Jarvisalt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"unique mix entertainment offer bishops castles michaelmas fair","story":"Barrel organ player, Dave Hill entertains crowds at this year#s Michaelmas Fltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtair.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision. But it secured a reprieve as a result of pressure from local politicians, including Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.Contractors are currently hard at work restoring and extending the facility which commands spectacular views over the country park from the front of the building and Strangford Lough from the rear.Cllr Walker, who for many years has been campaigning for more investment in the country park to provide an enhanced range of attractions for visitors, said many people were looking forward to seeing the councilrsquos future vision for Delamont.He said the country park was one of the best of its kind in the province and offered ldquounlimited development potential.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoIt is important that when the vision for the future is unveiled that local people are given an opportunity to study the document and provide comment on it.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and it is important that the local council presses ahead with its own investment plan to make Delamont even better, capitalising on its huge development potential.Delamont currently operates a hugely successful miniature railway, cafe, stunning walks and childrenrsquos adventure playground, but Cllr Walker believes so much more can be done.He added: ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.ldquoSecuring finance to enhance the country park is critical to its future development and I hope others funders will join with the council on this issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Resurfacing.jpg","title":"Resurfacing work set to start in Irish Street  ","story":"WORK to resurface Irish Street in Downpatrick following the completion of a pound, public realm scheme is expected to start imminently.Roads officials have indicated that concerns about the state of a derelict building close to the townrsquos former police base have been addressed, paving the way for resurfacing work to start.It was revealed last month that the project had been delayed due to issues over insurance and that the work could not take place until these are resolved.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he has been told by roads officials that concerns about the derelict building have been ironed out and that resurfacing work will begin.Work on the regeneration project was due to be completed by March, but it was the end of June before contractors finally moved off site, with traders in the area expressing anger about the impact the delayed scheme was having on business.The delay also had a knock-on effect on traffic congestion in other parts of the town as a result of the temporary one-way traffic system in Irish Street.Managed by the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities and Newry Mourne and Down Council, the scheme has resulted in new granite paving, street lighting and street furniture.The delay in completing the public realm work within the anticipated three-month timeframe was blamed on a number of factors, described as ldquounforeseen works issues, that resulted in the loss of construction time and delays in delivering the scheme.Issues which arose included the identication of asbestos piping along both sides of Irish Street which resulted in the works contract being put on hold for eight weeks. In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town. The street has been transformed as a result of signicant investment which was long overdue.Cllr Curran said a new group was formed in July to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street, with the so-called lsquorevitalisation fundingrsquo provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward has been formed, with traders encouraged to come up with schemes to improve shop fronts.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThis is a timely initiative given what the Irish Street traders had to endure for the first six months of the year. It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings. This means that the spotlight will be on Irish Street for the foreseeable future.As part of the planned commercial development, the townrsquos former police base, which enjoys protected status, could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.Local council officials say they are excited at the development potential the Irish Street site offers and want to maximise its development opportunity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Saintfield.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s recent run ended by Rosemount  ","story":"SAINTFIELD United ed to Pigeon Hill on Saturday looking to make it three league wins in a row, but it wasnrsquot to be as Rosemount Rec where eventually able to leave with the spoils.The Saints started the game brightly and in the opening minutes created a few opportunities, but against the run of play Rosemount took the lead when their number nine cut in from the left and found the bottom corner.From then on, Rosemount started to dominate possession and they found a second when a long-range effort found the bottom corner.

Wins over Tullylish, Teconnaught and Ballymartin has propelled them into the last four.The only blot on their landscape was a defeat to Ballymartin, but they avenged that loss later in the competition. However, they have not faced any side as good as Darragh yet and Jody McGovern, Jack Haughey, Niall Rafferty, Conor Donnelly and Kevin Hegarty will have to be at their best and then somethey are to get the better of Darragh.Glenn, seen as many punditsrsquo favourites to win the competition, then take on St Johnrsquos in what promises to be another close encounter.Glenn may not have made the impact on Division  as they would have liked, but they have been impressive in championship outings against Liatroimand Saul, winning all three games in style.St Johnrsquos have been as equally impressive and wins over Annaclone, Drumgath and Teconnaught have taken them to the brink of a final.The Johnnies will again rely on the firepower of John Clarke, Marty Keenan, Danny and Chris McKay and Conor Morgan to get them over the line, but they must beware the attacking abilities of Mattie Bagnall, Denis Murtagh, Jarlath McConaghy, Jack McCartan and Patrick Brooks.The top clash of the weekend at Pairc Esler on Saturday night then takes centre stage with Clonduff out to ruinrsquos Kilcoorsquos double bid.Kilcoo, who are sitting pretty at the top of Division , look certain to regain their ACFL crown, but nothing less than winning the Frank OrsquoHare Cup will do a hungry Magpies camp.However, you have to admire Kilcoorsquos resilience and fortitude.

He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

He was handed a four-year custodial term.Molocia, also living in Smethwick, participated in ten break-ins and was jailed for six years and four months.Stoean, who was involved in two offences of burglary committed with others, received a four-year sentence.Passing sentence, Judge Murray Creed said of the conspiracy: ldquoIt had an international perspective ndash the court has heard about trips to Romania but there was also money laundering which involved countries as far apart as India and Spain.ldquoThe lestyle that you Zaharia and your partner Spiru followed could be seen in the pictures on Instagram and where ndash the shoes filled with money in somebodyrsquos bedroom.Adding that the gang had caused untold misery, Judge Creed said it was up to other agencies to decide whether deportation proceedings would follow the prison terms.Commenting after the sentencing, West Midlands Police Sergeant Sandy Thompson, who helped to lead the investigation, said: ldquoThis was a challenging investigation as none of the five were on the radar of law enforcement in the UK until Zaharia was arrested in autumn .

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.
