It is now expected to be run as a business, said Richard Thomas, of Christie \u0026amp Co. “The owner had hoped it could become a single dwelling again, but the new buyer, a high net-worth inidual, has plans to run it as a business: either a hotel or as separate lodges.”The house was sold at auction in 2017 and was put up for sale again in November 2018 with a guide price of £2m.Wordsworth was based in Alfoxton in the village of Holford, near Bridgwater, Somerset, for 12 months from 1797, along with his sister, Dorothy, the diarist.There, with his admiring friend Coleridge a constant visitor, they spent one of the most productive periods in poetic history.Among the greatest works to have sprung from their days watching the seasons pass by on the slopes of the Quantock Hills are Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, while Wordsworth’s equally famous poem, Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey, inspired by his walk in the neighbouring Wye Valley, was added to the first edition of their Lyrical Ballads in 1798 at the last minute.Dorothy began her journal here in January 1798, and continued it when the siblings moved back to their native Lake District later that year.Champions of Alfoxton include Liz Fuller of the campaign group Save, who has welcomed the “great news” about the property.“This is a remarkable house with a rich history and clearly needs urgent help to prevent it from standing empty any longer,” she said. “It has been on the market for a while now, so this new development is encouraging.”The house stands in 50 acres of land and looks out across the Bristol Channel to Wales. Much of it dates from 1710, when it was rebuilt after a fire. During the second world war it became home to evacuated pupils of a preparatory school in Kent and then began a new existence as a hotel in the 1960s. The dormitories of the school, and later the rooms of the hotel, were each named after poems.For the writer Adam Nicolson, author of The Making of Poetry: Coleridge, the Wordsworths and their Year of Marvels, the decline of Alfoxton has been a cause of sadness.“Somerset is the cradle of romantic poetry, but it is not mentioned as much as the Lake District. There was no other year in which so much great poetry was written, so why did this happen there and then?” Nicolson said when his book came out.“Alfoxton Park is rotting away, and I don’t know why someone doesn’t fix it up. Wordsworth’s house is one of the greatest places of the world and it is neglected – it is as important as the house Shakespeare was born in.”The academic Jonathan Bate, presenter of a radio series about Wordsworth, has also lamented Alfoxton’s fate.“The local council have helped smooth the path to a sale, which had a lot of legal conditions, because they are aware how much the house means to the community,” said Thomas.Fuller said that the house was added to Save’s buildings at risk register in 2016 after the organisation received a nomination from a member of the public with a personal connection. “His school was evacuated to the house during the war and this is how he could tell us that the rooms were named after poems – he remembers the Ancient Mariner being one.”Fuller believe the house has “deteriorated quite a lot and is in quite a poor condition”. “We very much hope that the prospective purchasers will bring the house back to its former beauty and find a viable use for it whether as a hotel or otherwise,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66668576784b0adb1ef99a51ee09344b5b5fa7bd/0_118_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0777584b077e565ceb46ba617e591067","title":"citizenship precious right not to be arbitrarily revoked by the state","story":"‘A transcendental power, more than any man should possess.” So said Lord Houghton in 1870 in response to William Gladstone’s plan to acquire the ability to revoke the naturalisation of any inidual who “acted in a manner inconsistent with his allegiance as a British subject”.Houghton added that not only was too much power being placed in the hands of the executive but the law was also discriminatory in dealing “differently with naturalised than with British-born subjects”. Parliament agreed and rejected the proposal. Now, 150 years later, Houghton is a forgotten figure. That proposal, however, has been entrenched in British law. The government enjoys far greater “transcendental power” to deprive Britons of citizenship than even Gladstone could have imagined.A flurry of recent cases, from the revocation of Shamima Begum’s citizenship, to the deportation to Jamaica of people the government regards as “foreign criminals”, to the Windrush scandal, reveals the consequences. Each case is distinct. Begum’s is about the ability of the government to revoke the citizenship of a British-born person. The deportations raise the question of whether iniduals, many of whom came here as children, should be seen as “foreign” because they committed a crime when, had they not done so, they might have been seen as British. At the heart of the Windrush scandal are British citizens whom the authorities refused to see as such. What links them is a transformation in our perception of citizenship.“Will the minister confirm that British citizenship is a privilege, not a right,” asked Suella Braverman, the new attorney general, during last week’s Commons debate on the deportations to Jamaica. Home Office minister Kevin Foster was happy to confirm that it was.In 1870, MPs viewed citizenship as a right that should not be arbitrarily removed by the state. Today, it is viewed as a privilege, which many possess only under sufferance. Houghton recognised what many no longer do: that the revocation of citizenship is an extraordinary step that not only shatters lives but can tear at the moral fabric of the nation.It was in 1914, in wartime, that a government first successfully acquired the power to deprive Britons of their citizenship. Later laws, including the 1981 British Nationality Act, which redefined citizenship, affirmed the government’s right to do so. It was, though, a power used lightly. During the First World War, fewer than 40 Britons had their nationality revoked. During the Second World War, the numbers involved were even smaller: just four.Not until this century, in the wake of the 911 terror attacks and against a background of growing anxiety over immigration and multiculturalism, did the debate take a different turn. The overriding issue became not an unwillingness to provide the government with “transcendental power” but the belief that certain people did not deserve to be British.In a series of laws in the 00s, Labour allowed government to deprive anyone of citizenship, even if they had been born in Britain, if it was “conducive to the public good” to do so. After 2010, the coalition government went further. The 2014 Immigration Act institutionalised a “hostile environment” and allowed for revocation of citizenship even where a person may be left stateless.It’s not just the numbers that are startling but the two-tier system that is being created. As terrorism expert Shiraz Maher said: “Anyone with recourse to other citizenship (regardless of their connection to that country) is effectively being told their ‘Britishness’ is contingent upon continued good behaviour.” This would apply to “all children of immigrants, all Jews and everyone from Northern Ireland”. For what Maher calls the “British-British” – those without recourse to another citizenship – “their citizenship is protected and exists into perpetuity”.Because these changes apply primarily to jihadists or to criminals, most people support them. But the powers acquired by the state, and the discriminatory system being established, effect us all. MPs in 1870 understood that. We should do too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b5ed4038c4627efb53e558f66f3b92c519a8d05/0_140_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa200ffc16ab47eb774d43c8e4e2ccb7","title":"how science evolves just like human race","story":"For the past decade, scientists have thought that DNA sequences from Neanderthals were found only in non-African populations. Neanderthals, a human species that died out around 40,000 years ago, lived mainly in Europe and parts of Asia.A new study shows this is not true. Sub-Saharan populations do carry Neanderthal DNA. This is likely to have come not directly from Neanderthals in Africa but from ancient Europeans migrating back into Africa over the past 20,000 years.For years, scientists believed that our solar system formed through violent collisions between the original building blocks. Now, thanks to data from the New Horizons spacecraft, they are changing their minds. Launched in 2006, New Horizons has travelled to the edge of the solar system, to the Kuiper belt, which consists of millions of rocks, remnants from the formation of the planets. The spacecraft’s images of an object named Arrokoth, which is made up of two connected lobes, suggest the rocks fused slowly rather than violently, leading scientists to revise their views of how the planets formed.This is how science works – by reshaping theories as knowledge accumulates. For some, such as those who would deny the theory of evolution, this reveals science to be a false guide. Certainly, scientific knowledge is provisional and changes as we know more. It is also cumulative: the more we know, the more certain we can be. Both aspects are to be valued. They reveal not the weakness of science but its greatest strength."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6ba9019018d476c3ae35f3e208dd456f355e86d/0_0_3805_2283/master/3805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=575c01ca42f91db1ede50a04e11fb1a2","title":"labour should stop demonising the rich most britons like them","story":"Who would turn down the chance to be rich? Offered the opportunity to make a billion from launching the next big tech startup, I bet most would sign up without a second thought.For many, being wealthy is to be aspired to rather than derided or resented. This is one of the findings of new research on public attitudes to the rich, undertaken by academics at Loughborough, Birmingham and the LSE (and funded by the Trust for London, of which I am a trustee). It explored whether there is a public consensus about the level beyond which wealth becomes excessive or undesirable for society.The report should top the reading list for candidates to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. It turns out most people do not view the wealthy in the way the left wishes it would. In focus groups, most people acknowledged that excess wealth brings problems such as disproportionate political influence. But they did not, on the whole, feel angry with the rich if anything, the reverse held. While they were less keen on those who did not earn their wealth, they admired people they thought had worked hard to make it.It is easy to see how Labour ended up where it did. The biggest challenge facing the left is how to win in the face of the toxic populism that has been embraced by leaders on the right, from Boris Johnson to Donald Trump. Its “them versus us” narrative is anathema to progressive change: the idea of a corrupt elite set against the people further undermines trust in political institutions and it gains traction by inviting voters to blame groups, from immigrants to benefit recipients, for society’s ills.One school of thought is that the left should try to beat the right at their own game: replace immigrants with bankers, benefit scroungers with billionaires and you get something approaching the Labour campaign. The starting point seemed to be that sufficient numbers of voters are committed Marxists, if only they’d just realise it. And Labour assumed the public would get its vague allusions to “the few” – who they are and why they are a bad thing. Its manifesto referred to a “wealth grab by the privileged few” without unpacking what that meant and did not explain why people with more should contribute more in taxes – it just assumed this was self-evident.Labour seemed to assume that bringing voters onside was just a case of arguing the case more forcefully, rather than framing the arguments in terms that chime with people’s own values and beliefs. And so its campaign felt more like turning out the morally pure rather than persuading swing voters.This is consistent with new research about to be published by Tax Justice UK that found that, when making the case for a more progressive tax system, bashing the wealthy resonated far less well with voters than specific arguments about closing loopholes and increasing particular taxes. It might be less sexy than talk of predatory wealth extractors, but it is more effective. The left might also do well to focus on the instrumental rather than the moral case: tax as a building block for a better society rather than as a way to punish the undeserving rich.Hawkins warns that the left must be wary of broadbrush “them v us” narratives: not only are they not very effective, they can create a harmful spillover. Research by the New Economics Foundation found public thinking about the economy is deeply fatalistic: there is considerable scepticism about the power of politicians to make it fairer. Talking about how rigged the system is, as Corbyn has done, risks further embedding that sense of fatalism.It may be tempting to see the rewards reaped by the right from whipping up anger and feeding off resentment and to hope that progressive politicians could emulate that success by changing the target for something more legitimate. But the left should exercise caution before embracing populist tactics: they should be used sparingly, if at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2c751353d21560ebe04fa34b853c21f8b54264f/334_472_3779_2267/master/3779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24d3c29134f00532af8ac94e0d06a62","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of clash","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘clash’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘clash’.Share your photos of what clash means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 19 February at 10am.

The screen before you seethes with obliterating blackness. A blurred face appears for half a second, and occasional glimmers hurtle upwards like sparks up a chimney. But other than the deafening crankshaft thrum, there is almost nothing to confirm that we’re going to hell in a mineshaft.The TauTona mine in South Africa, otherwise known as Western Deep, is the world’s deepest gold mine. The miners have to descend more than three kilometres to reach the broiling depths, working the seams in the erratic light of their puny headlamps. Temperatures can rise to more than 80C.Suddenly there is silence suddenly a horrifying crash. The screen turns blindingly bright. A miner sits trembling, thermometer in his mouth. He speaks but we can’t hear his words. Then lines of miners are performing strenuous bench jumps in blue trunks, sweating it out in some eerie decompression chamber to the crackling pulse of a scarlet light. There is no day or night.Steve McQueen’s masterpiece, Western Deep operates as a succession of sound and vision shocks. Like the mine, it deprives the eyes of light, then assaults them with inexplicable bursts of colour, just as it veers between silence and shattering drills. This is art put to the service of truth. The camera tries to grasp what is nearly incomprehensible to the rest of us – the conditions of a penal colony far below the earth.A digital notice outside Western Deep – counting down the seconds like a little movie in itself – tells you when the next screening begins. You can’t go in before then. For this is a narrative work. McQueen has organised his first British retrospective since he won the Turner prize in 1999 with all the fierce attentiveness of the art films themselves.So you can walk round and round the seven-minute loop of Static, his 2009 portrait of the Statue of Liberty filmed in closeup from a circling helicopter. You can enter the double-sided film installation Ashes from either of two entrances, absorbing its complex story from different directions. Cold Breath, a glittering black and white film in which a nub of nipple is teased with gentleness and then unanticipated violence, is projected on a fittingly small screen so you have to come up close to be abruptly disconcerted.Made in 1999, when McQueen was 30, this is the earliest work in the exhibition bar a one-minute fragment of Super 8 from 1992 showing two elderly West Indian men carrying potted palms from east London’s Brick Lane on to the 243 bus to Wood Green, north London. Exodus is its subtle title. So the show’s time misses out a lot for a younger generation. None of the short films that first made his name are here for instance Bear, in which two naked black men (one of them McQueen) come together in a brief but mysterious sparring match, with every degree of sexual, political and cinematic ambiguity. Nor will you see Deadpan, in which McQueen reprised Buster Keaton’s famous facade-falling scene, which led to the Turner prize.It may be that the idea of Steve McQueen as the Hollywood director of Hunger, Shame, Widows and the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave has by now somewhat superseded his renown as a contemporary artist. If so, the inclusion here of a duff sculpture called Weight – a gilded mosquito net over a prison bed, made for the otherwise superb Artangel show commemorating Oscar Wilde’s time at Reading jail – certainly will not help.But connections are everywhere apparent between the films made for the cinema and those for the gallery. McQueen’s primary emphasis, for instance, on bodies in motion and at rest, stressed and flailing and under duress: this is a defining characteristic. He sets forth the human figure with singular force. You see that particularly in Western Deep, where the dazed and exhausted miners become monuments in the final moments.Sometimes he presses endurance to the limit. It is almost impossible to keep watching particular scenes in 12 Years a Slave, and yet the moral imperative is upon us witness at the very least an expression of respect. By comparison, a film from 2004 called Charlotte feels like a practice piece. The eye of Charlotte Rampling, immediately recognisable with its hooded lid, is touched and teased and revoltingly probed by McQueen’s own finger, in a variation on the notorious eye-slicing moment in Un Chien Andalou. The optical horror is exaggerated and yet also veiled in blood-red light.Look, don’t look. What can a camera show? In Caribs’ Leap, memorialising the islanders of Grenada who jumped to their deaths rather than surrender to French invaders in the 1650s, McQueen shows a man – or is it a ghost? – falling through the sky towards us and then vanishing into thin air. It is not clear if he is real or a figment. The screen is hoisted high: look upwards, and for the longest time he is not there.The other half of that film, showing a day in the life of contemporary Grenada, fishermen mending boats, children playing in the tide, is projected outside on to the front of Tate Modern: a big glowing portrait of free people. Most of the work in this show, whether political or not, has the character of a campaign.That is explicit in Ashes, where a beautiful young islander is shown buoyantly alive on the prow of a boat, riding the waves, his joyful charisma filling the frame. A friend remembers him in the voiceover: “Oh, he was great on the ocean, Ashes.” This lithe angel lives for ever in McQueen’s looping film. But on the reverse, quite deliberately, without any attempt to disguise the moral lesson, is the vision of hands slowly gilding his name on a tombstone. Ashes got caught up, found somebody else’s drugs.The most overtly political work here is the least effective: End Credits, concerning the remorseless, 30-year surveillance of the black actor, singer and activist Paul Robeson by the FBI. On screen, page after page of redacted FBI documents appear far too fast to be read. An actor recites others, equally fast and out of sync so that the cognitive dissonance is complete. Running at more than five hours, this is another form of endurance test, tripwired for failure.McQueen has talked in interviews about his frustration at not being able to make feature films as a young man, and the opportunities art gave him instead. In a sense, the clearest fusion between them is Static. A thousand directors have filmed the Statue of Liberty from a helicopter, and McQueen is up there too with his crew. The sight is riveting – face like thunder, ferocious diadem, the copper rusting, cracking, spattered with birdshit. She stands out, green and grave against the industrial backdrop, the Manhattan skyline, the glowering clouds, as the helicopter sweeps round and round.And eventually there comes a moment where Liberty is no longer static, where she herself appears to move, as if she has an independent spirit all of her own. The idea is very simple, and it would be wrong to overstate the political implications, but this film is beautifully subversive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3766b9d303332d4a77d09b7fa3a29e5104d41c4/0_328_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be002d6c4ea516b9932f2cf840f3c61e","title":"students in top universities told no room for you in lectures","story":"Students at prestigious universities have been turned away from overcrowded lectures and told to watch classes online or in overflow rooms.The Observer found that students paying £9,250 or more in Manchester, Nottingham and Lancaster, had struggled to get a seat in lectures. Manchester University maths students in a 600-capacity hall were given slips with a link to a YouTube live stream and told they could “sit in a coffee shop” and watch. They were also given the option of sitting in a separate overflow theatre to watch the stream, without being able to participate or question lecturers.Last October, the University of Nottingham advertised a £9.65-an-hour role for a temporary worker to monitor the overflow live stream for first-year law students. In November, psychology students at the University of Lancaster were sent to overflow rooms and given the option to watch lessons on their laptops because lecture theatres were full..Overflow rooms typically accommodate large audiences when well-known figures give public lectures. All the named universities said that overflow classes were a short-term arrangement to cover busy periods at the beginning of the academic year.Sofija (who declined to give her surname), a student at the University of Manchester who attended the maths lecture, told the Observer that she saw people being turned away. The economics undergraduate decided to stop going to the class because it was so difficult to concentrate.The National Union of Students, which represents higher education students, said that packed lectures were a result of “desperate” universities being forced to bring in as much tuition-fee income as possible.In a separate example of overcrowding, a physics lecture at King’s College London, one of 24 universities in the elite Russell Group, was reportedly so busy that students were told to “cram” in, with some standing at the back.Julio Figueroa, an international student from Mexico who pays more than £25,000 a year to study at King’s College London, said that he had to take his own chair into a physics lecture on at least two occasions. “We are in a Russell Group university, I feel like this shouldn’t happen,” he said.There is no evidence of the university running overflow lectures, and it said it had no knowledge of students taking their own chairs into lectures.Universities UK, which represents higher education providers, said it was important that all students could access lectures. “Universities will be mindful to ensure this does not compromise the quality of teaching or disadvantage students not attending in person. There is no indication of common or continuing issues with students being asked to join overflow or online lectures against their wishes,” a spokesperson said.The University of Manchester said that the maths overflow was temporary. “When overcrowding does occur, we work with schools to resolve it as quickly as possible and use various solutions, including moving the lecture to a larger location or splitting the cohort into smaller groups.”Nottingham said its overflow lecture was the result of a timetabling problem that affected a small number of students. “For a two-week period last September, a particular set of law lectures proved more popular than anticipated for the allocated theatre capacity,” it said. “Rather than disappoint students, we arranged a live stream of the lecture for some 20 students in the adjoining theatre, with full technical support and additional tutorials to ensure they could explore the lecture topic in person with tutors.”Lancaster said it had run overflow lectures owing to the popularity of its course. “There is always a staff member present in the streamed venue and there are mechanisms in place so students can ask questions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/864b5495ccb7492a4d325b0dcb7ab79a5153cde9/0_39_4498_2699/master/4498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ccc7b78490f9acbdb9253e6559e90c","title":"christiana figueres climate emergency this is the decade the future we choose","story":"The leader of the 2015 Paris accord talks about her new book, The Future We Choose, and why it’s crunch time for humanity• ‘The only uncertainty is how long we’ll last’: the worst case scenario for 2050• ‘Air is cleaner than before the Industrial Revolution’: the best case scenario for 2050Christiana Figueres is a founder of the Global Optimism group and was head of the UN climate change convention when the Paris agreement was achieved in 2015.Your new book is called The Future We Choose. But isn’t it too late to stop the climate crisis?We are definitely running late. We have delayed appallingly for decades. But science tells us we are still in the nick of time.You say this decade is the most consequential in human history…This is the decade in which, contrary to everything humanity has experienced before, we have everything in our power. We have the capital, the technology, the policies. And we have the scientific knowledge to understand that we have to half our emissions by 2030.So we are facing the most consequential fork in the road. If we continue as now, we are going to be irreparably going down a course of constant destruction, with much human pain and bioersity loss. Or we can choose to go in the other direction, a path of reconstruction and regeneration, and at least diminish the negative impacts of climate change to something that is manageable.But we can only choose it this decade. Our parents did not have this choice, because they didn’t have the capital, technologies and understanding. And for our children, it will be too late. So this is the decade and we are the generation.Only 11 pages or so of the book describe the terrible consequences of unchecked climate change, while the rest talks about the possibility of a much better world. Why?It’s important for everyone to face the negative consequences that we’re sleepwalking ourselves toward, which is why those 11 pages are there. But equally as important is to spark the imagination and the creativity that comes with understanding that we do have this incredible agency to create something completely different.We wanted to offer both universes to those who, understandably, are paralysed by despair and grief at the loss that is already under way, as well as those who are paralysed by their comfort and lack of understanding of the moment that we’re in.A lot of the book is about the need for a shift in people’s consciousness. Isn’t this rather grandiose or, on the other hand, too vague to make a difference in the real world?Whatever we hold as being possible, and whatever values and principles we live by, determine the actions that we take. Whatever we hold to be near and dear to us is what we’re willing to work toward. And so to shift from doom and gloom to a positive, optimistic, constructive attitude is very important because it is what gets us up in the morning and says “yes, we can do this, we’re going to work together on that”, rather than pulling the blanket over our head and saying “it’s all too difficult”. So that change in attitude inside ourselves is critical.We also have to understand that we can no longer live in a world based on limitless extraction and waste. Rather, we have to change our consciousness to one of regeneration.How can people’s consciousness change in that way?The first thing we have to understand is the consequence of not changing our attitudes. There are very serious existential consequences. Then hopefully we can make a serious, mature decision whether we want to choose something different.One of the 10 actions recommended in the book is to be a citizen and not a consumer. Can you explain that and why it is important?The very concept of being a consumer already points us in the direction of consuming irresponsibly. We have to be able at some point, particularly in developed countries, to get to the point where we say “enough is enough”. Before you make a purchase, or an investment, or any kind of decision that impacts on the planet and on other people, the question should be: “Do I really need this and is this actually conducive to furthering the quality of life on this planet?”Another of the actions you chose is building gender equality. Why?Educating young women and empowering women to come to decision-making tables is the strongest thing that we can do for the climate. When there are more women in boardrooms and in high-level positions in institutions, you get decisions that are wiser and longer term.Tackling the climate emergency requires global cooperation and action by governments and businesses. But what can iniduals do?We tend to forget that it is humans who have caused climate change, and we tend to export responsibility to large corporations or governments. The fact is, we all contributed to it.People reducing their emissions – by flying less, eating less meat and using clean energy, for example – is important.But is demanding that politicians tackle the climate emergency and voting accordingly perhaps the most important thing iniduals can do?I would say both. If we had 50 years to fiddle with this, then you could choose one or the other. But we are in such an emergency that we can no longer do things sequentially or exclusively. We have to be an “andalso” world.• The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac is published by Manilla Press (£12.99).

And this weekend, with London fashion week in full swing, it seems it is well and truly back.Most notably, it has been revived by London-based, vintage-inspired brand Rixo, which has garnered a cult Instagram following since its launch in 2015. Its capsule collection created in collaboration with the House of Christian Lacroix (THCL) was unveiled on Saturday and featured the kind of polka-dot prints and power suits that were synonymous with the label during its haute couture heyday.Rixo’s reputation as an “It Brit” brand will no doubt introduce the look to a young, social media-savvy generation, and is likely to cement its resurgence over the coming season.This follows a high-profile outing for a creation from the house’s original designer, Monsieur Lacroix. Earlier this month, actress Florence Pugh, nominated in the best supporting actress category for her role in Little Women, attended the Bafta awards ceremony wearing a hot pink ruffled gown from the Dries Van Noten x Christian Lacroix collection, which launched last September.In 1987, the New York Times’ fashion critic Bernadine Morris described the Lacroix aesthetic as akin to “a costume party where everyone has a good time”. His “more is more” style was summed up by his recurring role in Absolutely Fabulous, where Edina “Eddy” Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders) would intone “Lacroix, sweetie!” as one of her tone-deaf catchphrases.The capsule collection was shown alongside five Lacroix haute couture archive pieces, including a strapless tartan dress from 1992 and an asymmetrical black-and-white polka-dot “bubble” dress from 1991, in a London presentation overseen by the V\u0026ampA curator Stephanie Wood.Lacroix himself was absent. He lost the rights to his name when he sold his fashion house to LVMH in 1987, which then sold it to its current owners, the Falic family, in 2005. Lacroix left the company in 2009 and THCL is now headed by creative director Sacha Walckhoff. Lacroix has spent the intervening years curating museum exhibitions and designing stage costumes, as well as furniture.Topiol also confirmed that THCL was gearing up to make an independent return to womenswear – further evidence that the Lacroix look is here to stay. “I like the idea of initially doing these collaborations, working with younger up-and-coming brands,” he says. “We are definitely looking forward to having our own, standalone line in women’s fashion, but we are not in a rush.”London fashion week is not the first time the Lacroix look has been back in the limelight. In January, THCL collaborated with sustainable denim brand Blanche for a capsule collection that merged “the clean lines and functionality of Scandinavian minimalism, with the grandeur and glamour of French maximalism” and was shown during Copenhagen fashion week.The fashion historian Tony Glenville can see why the Lacroix look is back: “He is a superb colourist and, as we’ve seen from New York fashion week, colour is what is driving a lot of newness, rather than the clothes themselves. His clothes and accessories look ‘right’ in 2020, which they didn’t when he left fashion.“Then it’s the optimism of Lacroix, an injection of energy, wit and drama into fashion. It’s a step beyond anything current in terms of flamboyance and statement dressing. Elements of his influence have been popping up all over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea6d012422bd0fe5c1c80c20d6aa5f676a8b4cf/0_1674_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d081e7d0f344d75297f915d8f207fc3","title":"spring clean the key looks from the new collections in pictures","story":"Power shoulders, pastels, frills and black tie dressing, we take some of the trends from the SS20 season for a spin• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f9b45ba6bd588ea2eac64e2a335daae8a84a0fb/0_115_5114_3068/master/5114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c405e6b64f250f55d0a01d83b069f8f1","title":"harvey weinstein trial jury deliberations","story":"The #MeToo movement received barely a mention at the movie mogul’s rape trial but is likely to bear heavily on deliberationsThe jury at Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial in New York will begin deliberations on Tuesday, with the world’s media and the expectations of the #MeToo movement bearing heavily upon them.The five women and seven men who form the jury hold in their hands the fate of the disgraced movie mogul. If they find him guilty of two of the five counts against him, of “predatory sexual assault”, he could be sentenced to life in prison.Since the trial began last month, the jurors have constantly been reminded of intense media interest in the case.Prosecutors and Weinstein’s lawyers have frequently directed jurors’ vision to the overflowing press benches in courtroom No 99 at the New York supreme court, and alluded to the sound of keyboards rattling as one way of highlighting the high-profile nature of the case.The process of reaching a verdict will not be easy or brief. The first trial of Bill Cosby, the comedian whose prosecution is often compared to that of Weinstein, ended in a mistrial when the jury failed to agree after six gruelling days of deliberations.Cosby was found guilty at a second trial and sentenced in 2018 to three to 10 years in prison.There are two main accusers in the Weinstein case.Miriam Haley was working as a production assistant in 2006 when she alleges Weinstein lured her to his SoHo apartment in New York and forced oral sex on her.A woman who the  is not identifying, as she has not indicated that she wishes to be publicly named, alleges she was raped in a New York hotel in 2013.Weinstein, 67, has also been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 100 women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.In the New York trial, four women who accuse the producer of rape and sexual assault – Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young – were called by the prosecution to give supporting evidence.In closing arguments, Weinstein’s lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno, and lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon presented the jury with starkly contrasting summaries of the case.Though #MeToo, the social reckoning galvanised by the accusations of sexual abuse levelled against the Pulp Fiction producer since 2017, has rarely been mentioned in court, it has clearly influenced the lawyers’ diametrically opposing interpretations of the case in hand.Rotunno has portrayed the six women as money-grabbing, manipulative iniduals who exploited Weinstein in order to advance their careers. According to that view, they were prepared to do anything – including consensual sex – in order to get on.On Friday, Illuzzi-Orbon gave a very different analysis. Weinstein, she said, treated women who he tricked into entering his lair like “ants he could step on without consequences”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb40bf1f6756caba62b7b4cc06efff474d8ee9e5/0_27_4049_2429/master/4049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=791389fb36c65f1435c4d5a2801aea34","title":"norwich liverpool premier league match report","story":"The numbers keep on racking up for Liverpool. Twenty-five points clear at the top of the table, 76 points from a possible 78 this season and an unbeaten streak that runs for 43 matches, back to January 2019. Here, a 17th straight league victory was decided by Sadio Mané’s 100th goal in English football. That 19th league title just keeps getting closer.While the big picture can sometimes seem boggling, the smaller details remain more readily comprehensible. This was another match in which the champions-elect had to graft, bide their time and enjoy some luck before earning a deserved victory.Norwich played their football, as they always do, and had chances which they squandered, as they often do too. They were also disciplined and resolute in their defending and, as the contest reached the final stages, a draw looked a realistic possibility. But then Liverpool found a way.It came from a long ball, sent forward by Jordan Henderson in the 78th minute. Mané was standing between two Norwich players on the edge of their box and one of them, Christoph Zimmermann, got up early to meet the ball. The German missed it, however, perhaps aided in part by a push from the Liverpool forward. But before anyone had a chance to even cry foul play Mané had taken the ball under control, spun and shot low, left-footed inside Tim Krul’s right-hand post.“It’s also down to the unbelievable quality of Mané, he knows exactly which moment he has to be there with the little hit against the centre-back. Then there was a top-class first touch and a world-class finish.”Mané had begun the match on the bench after his return from a hamstring injury and Liverpool missed his poise and penetration. The first half was a keenly contested but ultimately dry stalemate, with Norwich creating the only chance of note in the 35th minute.Again it was a long ball over the top, a frequent tactic from both sides when the force of Storm Dennis was behind them, and it sent the midfielder Lukas Rupp clear on goal.One on one with Alisson, Rupp did brilliantly to round the Brazilian. But in the decisive moment he saw Teemu Pukki advancing on his left and, instead of shooting, tried to play the Finnish striker in instead.It was a decent enough pass but not sharp enough to elude Alisson, who was down on the floor and clawing the ball away before Pukki could get a touch.In the second half things opened up, even before Mané’s arrival. Norwich carried a threat on the counterattack, especially through Todd Cantwell and Max Aarons, the two Norwich youngsters who have substantially enhanced their reputations this season. But Liverpool were now creating chances too.In the 59th minute Krul made an incredible double save, denying Mo Salah and Naby Keïta. Kenny McLean had lost possession for Norwich just outside the area and, after a short exchange of passes, Salah was into the box and had created space for a shot.It was low and to Krul’s right but the Dutchman got down and blocked it with a strong arm. The rebound went only as far as Keïta, six yards out from goal, but his shot was blocked by Krul again with an incredible right-hand reaction. It was a moment that will surely have impressed the Netherlands manager, Ronald Koeman, watching in the Carrow Road stands.Mané came on a minute later and his arrival only accentuated the direction of the game. But before his goal Norwich had another opportunity with Alex Tettey seeing a fierce drive come back off the post. After it they had chances too. In the closing moments the hosts had their best chance of all, the substitute Emi Buendía sending Pukki clear of Virgil van Dijk only for him to hit a tame shot into Alisson’s arms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d32c96b866d9e8cd446fc2869d3166163fd7b5a/44_275_4093_2456/master/4093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fb39199d28eea080d5e11effb63554b","title":"steven bergwijn tottenham score for appie nouri psv eindhoven ajax","story":"Tottenham’s £25m signing from PSV Eindhoven is a childhood friend of Appie Nouri, the Ajax youngster who suffered permanent brain damage in 2017Steven Bergwijn was running in celebration before his debut goal for Tottenham against Manchester City hit the net, the one with which he announced his £25m arrival from PSV Eindhoven at the start of this month and sent jaws crashing to the floor all around his new club’s stadium.“If you look at the highlights, you can already see me run,” the 22-year-old says. He knew from the moment he took the perfect touch on his chest and certainly from when he made the sweetest of volleyed connections. But, really, Bergwijn knew before the game. He knew because of a promise he had made.To understand Bergwijn is to understand his friendship with Appie Nouri, the Ajax playmaker who had the world at his feet until the day in July 2017 when everything was ripped away. Bergwijn remembers how he had played in a pre-season friendly for PSV against RKC Waalwijk, scoring twice and feeling good. Then came the news from Ajax’s game with Werder Bremen. “My world collapsed,” Bergwijn says.Nouri had felt unwell and he almost placed himself on the ground, with the back of his head on the turf. He lost consciousness, suffered a cardiac arrest and, all of a sudden, this seemingly fit and healthy footballer was fighting for his life. Although he survived, he suffered catastrophic and permanent brain damage.Bergwijn met Nouri in the Ajax youth system when they were seven and they quickly became inseparable. “Since then we are best friends, brothers,” Bergwijn says. They shared the same field for six years until Bergwijn’s departure for PSV and they would continue to play together thereafter for the Dutch junior teams.There is no update on Nouri’s condition. The situation is impossibly sensitive and his family are keen to guard their privacy and that of their son. Suffice to say it is grave and Bergwijn’s voice crackles with emotion as he discusses it.“When I heard Appie had brain damage, I just can’t describe my feelings,” Bergwijn says. “At that time I didn’t sleep so much. In the first weeks I was scared to play, scared to go on the pitch because Appie was a young boy and out of nowhere … It was difficult. It’s still difficult. I speak to his brother every day but it’s still difficult.”Bergwijn speaks to Mohammed Nouri, Appie’s youngest brother, and their conversation before the City game was particularly poignant. Bergwijn has previously said that everything he does, he does for Appie. “I spoke with his brother and he told me: ‘You’re going to score for Appie,’” Bergwijn says. “And I said: ‘OK, watch me, I’m going to score.’ I did it.”When the goal went in, Martin Tyler provoked no little mirth when he roared in commentary: “Stevie Wonder!” but the nickname seems to have stuck. “Ah, Stevie Wonder,” says Seb on the training ground reception as he welcomes in journalists for this interview. The affection is plain. The club ambassador Ledley King is knocking around and he simply describes Bergwijn as a “lovely person”.With all the tattoos, the muscular frame and the pedigree as a PSV winger, there have been the inevitable comparisons to Memphis Depay, who is now at Lyon. Yet they are different characters. Whereas Depay is extravagant, Bergwijn is quiet, softly spoken. He is a devout Christian and one of his tattoos contains the opening line of Psalm 23 – The Lord is My Shepherd. But it is another two, emblazoned across his knuckles, that offer insight into his single-mindedness. “FEAR NONE,” they say.Bergwijn fell out of love with Ajax and, if the club’s youth management at the time – headed up by Jan Olde Riekerink – could do it all again, they would surely make different choices. When Ajax tried and failed to re-sign Bergwijn from PSV last summer, it felt like an admission that he had been one who got away.Ridiculously the seeds of the parting were sown over a dispute about a pair of regulation black-and-white Adidas boots. Bergwijn’s were worn out and so he asked the kit man for new ones, only to be told to forget it. Ajax would decide when it was time for a new pair. They were in charge. Bergwijn asked his father, also called Steven, and, seeing that his son needed them, he bought him a pair. When Bergwijn turned up in them the next day, the hierarchy were angry.All very bizarre but things snowballed and would reach the point of no return at a tournament towards the end of the 2010-11 season. Incensed at why his son was not playing, Steven Sr staged a one-man protest, waving a white handkerchief at the coach, Orlando Trustfull. What made the scene even more comical was that Trustfull was on the opposite touchline to him and might not have noticed. It is believed that the assistant referee on Steven Sr’s side – who was provided by Ajax – told Trustfull.“I didn’t have the feeling at Ajax any more and, if that’s gone, you have to leave,” Bergwijn says. “If I have no feeling, when my heart isn’t there, it’s over.”Aged 13, Bergwijn did not want to move from Almere, his hometown, which is half an hour outside Amsterdam, to Eindhoven, where he had been offered digs by a local family. And so his father would drive him there and back for training each day – a round-trip of at least three hours. Steven Sr was not a professional footballer but Bergwijn says his uncles were, with one of them having been on the books of Roda JC.“The alarm went off at 5.30 every morning,” Bergwijn says. “My dad drove me to Eindhoven for training at 9am, he slept in the car, it finished at 11am, then we went back and I’d be in school in Almere until 4pm. We did that for four or five years. After that I started living in Eindhoven.”The sacrifices have come to feel worthwhile, particularly after the dream move to Spurs, which did come with controversial trimmings. Bergwijn had phoned the PSV interim manager, Ernest Faber, on the morning of the club’s game against Twente on 26 January to tell him he wanted the transfer and to seek his blessing for a trip to London to tie things up, which he got. PSV, though, forbade him from travelling as they did not have an agreement with Spurs. Bergwijn travelled regardless.Cue a period of drama and haggling, during which Bergwijn took the unusual step of releasing a video in which he insisted he had not refused to play against Twente. In the end everything was resolved and Spurs had a player their scout Brian Carey had watched extensively for two years. Other clubs had wanted him at various times, including Internazionale, Sevilla and Leicester. To Spurs it felt like a coup.“My father called me and said: ‘Pack your stuff, you’re going to London,’” Bergwijn says. “It was fast. I didn’t expect to make the transfer in January. I thought in the summer. But if Tottenham wants you, you can’t say no.”Bergwijn has played only one Premier League game but what struck him against City was the intensity and physicality, which he also noticed in PSV’s Champions League game against Spurs at Wembley last season. One thing is clear – he has the physique to cope.Bergwijn was relatively slight when he joined PSV and it meant he had to concentrate on his game intelligence and technique. But he slowly filled out, to the point where he acquired what the Dutch like to call the frame of a “wardrobe”. “It’s genetic. I’m not so much in the gym. I don’t push weights. It’s natural, core.”At PSV Bergwijn learned from a few old masters on the coaching staff, namely Ruud van Nistelrooy, Luc Nilis and Boudewijn Zenden. He can now feel the surge of expectation levels but, asked whether he could achieve the same status in England as Van Nistelrooy, he does not seek to dampen them. “That’s why I’m here,” Bergwijn says. “You want to be the biggest, the greatest. I hope I can be that big in England.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42fea9848c4ddc2ca2246fa896c20f447c0d476f/0_162_2693_1616/master/2693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18acaabb4b8f59b924508c2e99f60382","title":"champions league ban manchester city butterfly","story":"Champions League ban raises threat of Pep Guardiola and his squad’s high-class, well-paid talents jostling for the exitAnd it’s all over now, baby blue. At a stroke of Uefa’s judicial hand Manchester City have been transformed into an outlaw team. From here the future looks not just uncertain, but fraught with peril.It is impossible to predict the endgame of Uefa’s startling decision to ban the reigning English champions from European competitions for two seasons. For City supporters the response will no doubt be one of weary defiance. Perhaps there might be some gallows consolation to be found in the fact history suggests they don’t stand to lose too much in any case.A few desultory midweek home games. A VAR-inspired outrage, with attendant basement conspiracy theories. A quarter-final defeat to a heavyweight European power where Pep Guardiola gets the tactics wrong and sits looking sad and frail in his dugout.At the very least the home leg against Real Madrid next month should generate a bit of atmosphere. The edicts on not booing the Uefa anthem will no doubt be strictly observed.This feels like a much wider tipping point for European club football, for a particular model of ownership and, above all, for the management and playing personnel at the Etihad. City have been a wonderful champion team. Right now they look like a butterfly in danger of having its wings picked off.City’s hierarchy will appeal against the ban and fine, no doubt with the same contemptuous aggression they have contested these financial charges from the start. Billionaires, let the record note, really don’t like being told what to do.But barring some unusually rapid judicial process, it is hard to see exactly how they can hope to keep Guardiola. There has been a feeling the manager might be on his way. This is an issue that will take some time to settle. More immediate, and indeed related, is the question of how City hope to go on paying their players.There has been something oddly reckless about this project from the start, the sense of a beautiful team running on air. Never apologise, never explain: even relative failure this season in the league has come on Guardiola’s own terms, with the refusal to go through the prosaic business of strengthening his defence, in the process also weakening his team’s midfield.For all the good husbandry and good habits, the fine coaching, the refusal to splurge on superstars, City have still spent £340m net in transfer fees since Guardiola has been at the club, and hundreds of millions before that, all the while failing to produce a single homegrown first-team regular. Was it ever sustainable? Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, might just have had a point all along. The numbers really don’t add up.On one side of this equation City have the third-highest wage bill in world football at £300m. At the same time City have the fifth-largest income. Take out that self-fuelling Etihad sponsorship deal and they’re back in eighth. An inability to grow their commercial income has been the sticking point.The grace note is the growth in broadcast income. Crucially it is here City stand to lose under the Uefa ban. Third in wages, fifth in income might look wonky but without their Uefa income the balance goes through the floor, with some estimates suggesting a loss of European football could cost between £100m-£150m per year.This would leave an apocalyptic hole, one that makes the current squad simply unsustainable. City recently handed new deals to a rump of first-team regulars, which hardly eases the basic problem of how to keep the lights on.Perhaps worse, a significant number of City’s most desirable assets will enter the last two years of their deals during the ban. Fernandinho, Leroy Sané and Sergio Agüero are all out of contract in June 2021. Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gündogan are free to leave in 2023.Good luck trying to persuade a crop of high-class, mid-career elite level players to miss two years of top-table football. Plus agents come into this. Contracts will contain force majeure clauses. Nobody wants to become cold product or to lose the bonuses associated with the Champions League.At the same time the squad is ageing. City’s best midfielder is 34, their best striker 31. This was always looking like a time to rebuild. Instead it looks like a moment of total flux.There aren’t enough takers out there to house all of these supremely well-paid players, raising the vague threat of an unseemly jostle for the door, of expedient loans, of captive princes on draining contracts.If the ban sticks it is hard to see past this disaster scenario. The greatest decade in Manchester City’s modern history is over. They’ll be going round this town shouting “bring out your dead”.A little dramatic perhaps. We are some way off this. But no doubt plenty will cheer at the prospect and not only for tribal reasons. There is an argument FPP shouldn’t exist at all, the suggestion any kind of restraint or protectionism is simply pulling up the rope ladder.Slightly absurd arguments have been made that the state-funded entity that owns City is being unfairly excluded from sport’s global elite, that it should be able to storm its way instantly to the top table simply by virtue of possessing unanswerable fossil fuel revenues. It is the kind of view you can only entertain if, at bottom, you really do like billionaires.These arguments will be tested, by implication, at the court of arbitration for sport. City may be exonerated. For now the rules exist and City have been held to have broken them, in a notably graceless manner.As such their success will be tainted, achievements that have out of necessity deprived others of glory, spending that has inflated the market, unsettled players, depleted opponents.But whatever the morality here – and history will withhold its verdict for now — it is impossible not to feel a note of sadness. For all the surrounding murk and the money spent, the rules bent, the arrogance of the club hierarchy, City under Guardiola have also been the most beautiful team of the Premier League era.Forget the stain of over-spending. We’ll always have that 100-point season. We’ll always have 15-0 across eight days against Liverpool, Feyenoord and Watford. We’ll always have that 44-pass goal against Manchester United, almost 1,000 passes against Swansea, the way the ball seems to become a living, mischievous thing, skittering about between the light blue shapes in a shared, rotational choreography.We’ll always have that moment at the Etihad last February against Chelsea where Agüero scored a goal so stunning – an explosive moment of skill, but also a kind of coronation for his team – that the whole ground fell silent for a second, then broke into a swell of gentle applause as the replay appeared on the big screen.This isn’t over. Billionaires don’t like to lose. City’s statement in reply to the judgment has its own notes of vengefulness, a firm hint that this process has by no means run its course. Let’s remember the best of that City team, and with kindness too. In the most practical sense, we may not see their like again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54f7fa9cfe39c44237f0d8bf58fb0df1768134ec/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=708e6a33dd6148f313ac0e1331346609","title":"manchester city fans blame envious old order clubs uefa ban","story":"Across the road from the vertiginous south stand of Manchester City’s stadium, a glut of conspiracy theories was already swirling among the early-afternoon loyalists at Mary D’s Bar.Minutes after opening its doors at midday on Saturday, the landlord, Mick Kehoe, was rehearsing the already well-versed sense of persecution that had gripped the club’s supporters since the unwanted news of the night before.The Friday evening bulletins had revealed that Manchester City had been banned from the Champions League for the next two seasons after being judged to have committed “serious breaches” of Uefa’s financial fair play regulations.Kehoe was fuming. “A lot of City fans are feeling that their club has been made a scapegoat. We feel there’s a bit of jealousy, a bit of conspiracy, because Uefa have always had it in for us,” said the 62-year-old whose pub is the closest to the Etihad Stadium.In fact, the hostelry was serving drinks to east Manchester for close to a decade before the stadium was built in 2002. Now, on match days, it is crammed to its 1,200 capacity by supporters, many of whom will crave more than ever that their club should lift the Champions League trophy in three months’ time.“What’s happened is seismic, but what actually happens if City win the biggest competition in Europe this year and then the Premier League next year and the year after?”Five minutes’ walk from May D’s lies another famous City pub, The Townley. Inside, licensee Pauline Carroll was similarly seething. And, like Kehoe, the 50-year-old was not slow to share the sense that her club, the reigning Premier League champions, had been unfairly targeted by Uefa following simmering tensions since 2014 when City were fined £49m for a previous breach of regulations.“There’s a prejudice against City and it’s not the first time Uefa have had it in for us. My two sons reacted in pure disbelief when they heard and, talking to people on social media and various supporters groups, everyone agrees it’s just a way of getting at us. The worst thing is that a lot of people were not even that surprised,” said Carroll.In a robust statement issued shortly after Uefa’s decision was made public, even the club said they were “not surprised” by the judgment. Describing the punishment as “prejudicial”, Manchester City have said they will appeal against the penalty, which also includes a €30m (£25m) fine.Carroll said that the refrain among her regulars was that City had been persistently singled out in a way other clubs were not. “The consensus is that everybody’s against us,” she said.Like Kehoe, she was serving locals before the gleaming stadium appeared and has relished her club’s evolution into one of Europe’s football superpowers after its acquisition in 2008 by Sheikh Mansour, brother of Sheikh Mohammed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi.But Carroll said Friday’s judgment held ramifications that were not just sporting. The Townley can hold up to 450 people on a match day, including 100 in the beer garden, producing takings of up to £4,000 on a Champions League night.Some of those who attend the club’s European fixtures travel for hours. Dave Walker, 56, journeys from Worcestershire. He claimed that the financial fair play regulations City were found guilty of breaching were crafted to ensure that clubs like City could not gatecrash the “old order” of Europe’s most successful clubs.“It’s naked protectionism, to stop others getting to the top table. I can’t think of any other business where an owner of a company would be prevented from investing in their own commercial concern. Say Sheikh Mansour was an industrialist, would there really be a body saying: ‘You’re only allowed to invest the profits you make and nothing else’?”He agreed that enmity between Uefa and Manchester City had been building since the 2014 fine, noting that the club’s supporters already booed the Uefa Champions League anthem before kick-off“Now, it’s all-out war, there’s no velvet gloves. It’s us against Uefa and it’s all coming to a head.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ee8492550d4fafab1eb6522c0cc385b019ea61/0_59_3053_1832/master/3053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=717c6ec48d17b9b44cd83487c4b6d1f4","title":"powerplay how chancellor lost control of no 11","story":"For a decade Whitehall has been left in little doubt of the special adviser’s powerAs Tory MPs gathered in parliament on Wednesday evening, just hours before a reshuffle that most believed would be intriguing rather than explosive, they gave a warm welcome to the opening speaker. A grinning Sajid Javid, whose position as chancellor had previously been publicly guaranteed by the prime minister, said a few warm words before introducing Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor who talked them through his plans. For those in the room with doubts about Javid’s future, his cameo reassured them that he would survive the imminent ministerial cull.Despite the smile, however, Javid himself had become less confident in his position in the days leading up to Thursday’s reshuffle. He confided in friends that he feared his special advisers were being targeted by Downing St. A week of damaging media briefings about the forthcoming budget and relations between the Treasury and No 10 had raised fresh doubts. Those doubts were well founded: by late morning, he had gone.Last night, Javid’s allies remained furious about Boris Johnson’s demand that Javid sack his advisers as part of a plan to combine the No 10 and No 11 team of special advisers, or “spads” – an inflammatory order that Javid felt compelled to refuse. However, they were clear on what was behind the surprise demand, which was presented as an afterthought by the prime minister at the end of a long and otherwise good-natured meeting with his now former chancellor.“The hierarchy of the move would be: 1, power and process, 2, policy and 3, personality,” said one Javid ally. “It was predominantly about a frustration about the sheer power of the Treasury. It’s very difficult to do something about that, short of massive Whitehall reorganisation. The one lever they had was the spad universe. It was a change of institutional power via the backdoor. It wasn’t so much a joint team as a No 10 team.”Both Javid’s friends and senior figures across Whitehall are now trying to decipher a bigger question posed by the No 10 power grab, which dominated the reshuffle: would it come to be seen as the high watermark of the influence of Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave mastermind and senior adviser to Johnson? Or was it just an early skirmish in a much more ambitious attempt to sideline officials and departments, and centralise power inside Downing St?As the reshuffle unfolded last week, Tory MPs were initially baffled by the survival of some figures. One minster was surprised and concerned to see their own secretary of state return, having concluded they would be fired – and believing their dismissal to be the right move.However, taken as a whole, Tories saw that the reshuffle clearly reflected the wider Cummings agenda. John Whittingdale, a critic of the BBC, made a surprise return as culture minister. Chris Skidmore, the respected universities and science minister, was sacked – with the science brief taken out of the job description. It is a move that could give Cummings more space to push for his pet project – the creation of a British Advanced Research Projects Agency, which he believes could create ideas and projects with “world-changing potential”. Julian Smith, who had raised concerns about a no-deal Brexit on relations in Northern Ireland, was fired.One Tory described Suella Braverman’s appointment as attorney general as a “blatant political appointment”. Braverman, like Cummings, is highly critical of what they believe is the politicisation of the judiciary, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling that Johnson’s attempt to prorogue parliament last year was unlawful. Meanwhile, Nus Ghani, a popular transport minister, was also sacked. She had been an enthusiastic supporter of Jeremy Hunt’s leadership campaign. “They want someone who will do what they’re told,” said a minister. “They’ve looked at difficult areas where they will need someone who is compliant.”For all the attempts to compare the Cummings power grab with Alastair Campbell’s dominance at the peak of New Labour, Whitehall veterans say the more telling comparison is with Ted Heath, who handed huge power to his official, William Armstrong, at the expense of the Treasury and his chancellor, Anthony Barber. Armstrong eventually had a breakdown, in the wake of the dispute with miners over the imposition of a three-day week.The frustration for Javid’s team was that while there had been early skirmishes over policy, they had not made the toughest decisions. The relationship between Javid and Johnson was strong. Javid invited just three MPs to his recent 50th birthday party. One was the prime minister, who sat on the top table. The attempt inside Downing St to talk Javid round was prolonged and genuine. First, members of Johnson’s staff attempted to change his mind, before a final one-on-one talk between prime minister and chancellor. Johnson is already said to have told senior Tories that he wants Javid back.However, in the week before the reshuffle, Javid’s team became concerned. Briefings emerged in the media, which they believe were designed to unsettle the No10 and No11 relationship – some believe stories about a possible mansion tax were planted, to be used as evidence against Javid and his team. The emergence of the idea on the front page of a newspaper last weekend baffled those working on the budget. The story didn’t seem to serve any purpose, other than to poison the well between No10 and No11, and foment distrust. In reality, insiders say that there were figures inside Downing St interested in a mansion tax, but that there were also sympathisers in the Treasury. However, Javid was already against the idea.There was also a briefing about a fallout between the prime minister’s partner Carrie Symonds and Cummings, suggesting that she was critical of his aggressive approach and argued against sacking Javid. The story cited “well-placed Treasury sources”, but Javid’s allies insist it did not come from them and they detect foul play. “It was dark arts,” said one friend.Treasury sources admit that a mistake was made in its handling of HS2, in which Javid’s backing for the project was announced before No10 had made an official decision to go ahead with the project. Other than that, there was little ammunition to throw at Javid. Indeed, when Javid asked the prime minister why his team should be dismissed, Johnson was unable to offer an argument.The big question is whether Sunak sticks to Javid’s fiscal rule, which promises to balance the books on day-to-day spending by the middle of the parliament. It is this rule that has restricted No10’s hopes of ploughing money into its “levelling up” agenda. The issue of the level of spending is now the coming battle within the Tory party.“You can’t just spend, spend, spend,” said one concerned minister. “Sooner or later, the inherent contradiction of saying ‘the Labour Party spend too much’ will be pointed out if we also decide to spend too much. I think Cummings has overreached himself and there will be grave concern, privately. It’s all right now, with no Labour opposition and no clarity on where the economy is going.“But I say to my Labour colleagues, they had more seats than us in 2005 and five years later, we were in government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e003cd833665960e31bc5d575e98b876c66b3b/0_361_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6691ead7eabb5125c8b8dfb4992eb3dc","title":"allan jenkins plot 29 gardens meditation spring","story":"After enforced rest for garden and gardener, it’s time to (slowly) start springI have been exiled from the allotment for a few weeks now in a smaller world of pain. The plot is at the top of a hill and walking steep slopes has been beyond me. The meditation medication it brings me has been unavailable. This weekend I think all that will change. Though it may involve taxis.A garden, I think, responds to constancy and attention. Fidelity, regularity and care are what works, as in any relationship. It doesn’t do so well when these are withdrawn, no matter the sound reason or intention.Like me, the plot and its plants work best with companionship.

I find an unspoken acceptance there, a place to release, to recharge, to be quiet.I need spring. It’s not too far away now. Soon it will be time to sort seed. There are still piles of dried Tagetes (marigold) flowers that need my attention and bagging up. Climbing nasturtium from last year’s poles needs to be mixed and sown with this year’s packets. There are deliveries for early summer still to come in – including for my lifetime’s search for the perfect single orange calendula.

But why? And what can she do about it?It is 3am. I know because I’ve checked the clock three times since I crept to the loo at 1.45am. Within minutes of my return to bed I feel the delicious fog of slumber evaporate, my heart rate rises and my brain begins its relentless scan for topics to keep me engaged. Occasionally, I get a laugh out of what I dream up as a priority worry more often I’m shocked by the banality. A thank you note I failed to send a year ago the small part for a kitchen appliance I keep forgetting to order whether I booked Ocado for Friday whether Stormzy will agree to talk to me about his favourite books the shirt my son needs guilt because I didn’t call my friend with breast cancer where to go on summer holidays how to get the car to its service in Yeovil why the person I discussed documentary ideas with hasn’t replied did I book a blowdry on Tuesday? And where has that blue dress gone?I look at the clock again, it’s 3.15am and I’m getting closer to the moment when I’m going to have to medicate or resign myself to staying awake. Now adding to my copious preoccupations: what do I have to do in the morning? Can I afford to be exhausted or should I resort to the cornucopia of drugs and sleep aids crammed into my bedside drawer? While I attempt to follow the cognitive behavioural therapy advice I’ve been given and count my breaths – five in, five out – to restore my equilibrium and compartmentalise the turmoil, my husband snores deafeningly beside me.He’s deep in a contented sleep that not even the alarm clock can halt, but if he knew how close to homicide this nightly inequity takes me, he wouldn’t be so relaxed. The tedium of my thoughts is frequently alleviated by a switch to murderous intent as my addled, sleep-deprived brain imagines how easily I could slide the pillow over his face and banish his noisy presence permanently.Despite a century of emancipation, women still do most of the backstage work that keeps the show on the road. Scratch the surface of this national insomnia pandemic and you discover that inequality is at the heart of the malaise. Aside from sexual politics and headline grabbers, such as #MeToo, most women’s lives aren’t improving quantifiably, they’re just different from 50 years ago.“It’s great that men and women are equals in the workplace, but what this means in reality is that women are effectively taking on twice the load,” says Dr Elle Boag, associate professor in social psychology at Birmingham City University. “Only too often we do the work, the domestic labour and the childcare (to be fair, sometimes these chores are shared). We’ve adopted this multitasking role and it’s become normative.” So, it’s no surprise that when we go to bed we find we can’t switch off.I’m one of the lucky ones. I married a man who can cook, adores being with his kids, can put up a shelf and, if I scream loud enough, will pick his dirty clothes up from on top of the laundry basket and put them inside it. He’s also brilliant at labelling, especially now he has a little machine to do it, and all his cupboards are helpfully marked up: socks, cardigans, long-sleeve T-shirts and so on. It may not feel like it, but apparently family structure has changed. “It’s all about expectation. Within almost a generation-and-a-half, we’ve shifted from the extended family to the nuclear family,” says Russell Foster, professor of circadian neuroscience at Oxford University. “This means that childcare is focused on the parents, and usually the mother, meaning she’s on call all the time. This in turn leads to awful guilt about not coping, which translates to stress, and therefore sleeplessness.”This certainly explains the medley of uncompleted chores that plays on repeat through the small hours to the accompaniment of rain falling on my Calm app.There’s also scientific speculation as to why men should be so deeply and contentedly asleep while women stay awake. “The data emerging suggests women tend to be more conscientious, as well as more flexible in the workplace. Work duration extends, meaning there isn’t enough time for everything else. So, you invade the night, and sleep is the first victim,” says Foster. In other words, women are sacrificing sleep in order to get everything done.It’s not quite the portrait of “having it all” we battle-weary veterans of three waves of feminism were expecting – millions of our sex, faces illuminated by the sleep- banishing blue light of our smart phones and PCs, organising play dates, ordering groceries, answering emails and trying to maintain our social lives into the early hours.The more cynically inclined might ask, who cares? You’re going to be dead soon enough, so you’ll get to catch up on your 40 winks for all eternity. It’s a fair point except that we’re all expected to stay active until we’re well into our 70s and 80s and the downsides of lack of sleep start with exhaustion and continue down a depressing spiral of health concerns, including increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, obesity and depression. In the light of these health dangers, getting enough sleep becomes an imperative. Foster agrees: “If you have a racing mind and continuously turn on the stress axis, elevated levels of cortisol suppress the immune system, which predisposes you to infection, and may even be responsible for higher rates of cancer. You’re throwing glucose into your circulation and changing the metabolic hormones: ghrelin, the hunger hormone, is released when you’re tired, and leptin, the satiation hormone, is reduced.”But how do we break this vicious cycle? So many of the health issues that are costing the NHS millions and debilitating the population in middle age are directly related to or influenced by the amount of sleep we get. And the gender gap is as apparent in our inability to sleep as it is in ision of childcare.“Men and women have different circadian rhythms, meaning that men are likely to go to bed later,” says Dr Neil Stanley, a sleep expert and author of How to Sleep Well. “This is evolutionary, from the times when women went to sleep with the babies and men stayed up later to ensure there was no danger. Only then would they too go to bed.”These days such “protection” of their nearest and dearest is more likely to take the form of a bottle of red wine and a couple of episodes of Fortitude. “When men do go to bed, they often disturb the lighter-sleeping women, who then struggle to go back to sleep,” adds Stanley.Although it’s tempting, I can’t lay the entire burden of a nation of insomniac women on men not picking up the slack. Another reason experts give for our lack of quality sleep is that we simply aren’t moving enough.Women’s sleep deprivation may once have been synonymous with menopause, but as Why We Can’t Sleep outlines, being wide awake while the (male) world sleeps is no longer the preserve of the 50-plus struggling with hormone deficiencies. Young working mothers are almost as afflicted as Generation Xers, suggesting that it’s societal pressure rather than biological programming that’s at the root of our nocturnal nightmares. I know I’m not unique. The hardest part of becoming a parent, in my case extremely late, has been the extending of my working day to include two jobs: one running our home and the other my paid labour.At a family get-together, I listened to one of my brothers arguing for the principle of a universal basic income, citing experiments in wealthy countries like Norway. It struck me as I listened to this impassioned, childless, metrosexual that the real “equaliser” would be something much more specific – bring back the pioneering Wages for Housework campaign of the 1970s, led by an international collective that described housework as “capitalist abuse”. The domestic burden shouldered by the majority of women has a long-term devastating impact on women’s finances.Having established some of the contributors to our insomnia, I’ve been looking for answers. So far I’ve tried CBD (quite helpful) having a bath with lavender oil (occasionally helpful) sleeping pills (very helpful, but I don’t want to be addicted) white noise (better than just the sound of my thoughts rattling around) melatonin (in small doses and taken regularly it definitely helps and it’s available on the NHS, but only for over 55s) Horlicks (just makes me thirsty) doing less work (works a treat, but hard to pay the bills) the Calm app (pleasantly distracting) and HRT (studies show it can help with sleeplessness in menopause, although it didn’t resolve the problem for me).Now, a new book, Fair Play by Eve Rodsky, sets out a plan to highlight the real cause of so much of our insomnia: the less-burdened partner sleeping next to us. Promising to press the reset button on your relationship by equally iding the domestic burden, it gets the thumbs-up from none other than Reese Witherspoon. The actor describes it as “a hands-on guide for navigating the hot-button issues that so many families struggle with”.With chapter titles like “Living in Your Unicorn Space”, it seemed to me a bit dubious, but the rules Rodsky asks us to enforce, starting with All Time is Created Equal, are sensible enough. More compellingly, Reese looks like she gets plenty of sleep and remembers to book her blowdry, and runs a successful company and has her own book club – and even has two children. How does she manage to have it all? There’s something to fixate on in the small hours.Meanwhile, join me in one last great revolutionary moment – where we recognise, call out and reapportion the domestic burden that’s trapping women in an unsustainable pattern of insomnia and stress.

It’s vital children are allowed to be frivolousThe dilemma My daughter is 13 and while she seems like a normal, happy teenager much of the time, she has frequent breakdowns about her future, the future of the planet, politics. It came to a head when she couldn’t stop crying and said: “I hate living. I wish I was born in a world before TV and internet, so I didn’t have to deal with all this stuff.” She went on to say: “What’s the point when we’re all going to die anyway? All we do is wake up and it’s the same thing again and again until we die.”I’ve seen no signs of self-harm and she has a trusted group of friends around her. I’ve suggested that we do something that is tangibly meaningful, like helping out at a refugee centre, but it all meets with the same response: it won’t make a difference. I talked to her about people who have made a difference – the suffragettes, Martin Luther King, Greta Thunberg – but all are met with tears of resignation. I’ve talked to her about what we can do, or are doing: being vegetarian, recycling, reducing packaging, but it doesn’t allay her angst.Holding her in my arms last night while she cried about her future, the future of the world and the planet, prompted me to write. Half of me wants to say: you’re right. Is it my fault for sharing politics with her?Mariella replies Perhaps. Maybe you need to mix it up a little bit at breakfast. Put your fears for the planet aside, switch off the Today programme, fold up the  and put on some Abba? Have some fun together. I’m not saying you two can’t get around to solving imminent planetary meltdown, but right now you need to prioritise.Your girl is a teenager, and already likely to be struggling with the sort of hormonal cataclysm you’ll be reacquainted with yourself when you hit 50. In her elevated emotional state she’s capable of getting herself worked into the same frenzy about global warming as about the injustice of missing a friend’s birthday party. That makes it hard to understand what’s really an issue and what’s being temporarily adopted as one.And don’t discount her desire for your full focus and attention. The further she progresses into her teens the more she’ll act as if she’s shrugging you off, but, conversely, she’ll actually still want you in her orbit at the same time.She clearly thinks the way to your heart is through her social conscience, which is why you might want to open some other avenues of mutual interest. One of the hardest things to work out is how to offer the love and support teenagers need while not getting on their nerves, invading their space or being plain “annoying”.My secret weapon is a simple waiting game. I just sit on my daughter’s bed – sometimes for hours on end – until she finally treats me to a titbit of what’s in her head.But you must remember, there’s normal teenage behaviour and then there’s the worrying variety. Your daughter sounds like she needs careful monitoring at the moment, and you certainly need to be on the alert for signs that her despondency runs deeper than is healthy for her. Consult a mental health professional, or your GP, or contact a charity such as YoungMinds, just to be sure she’s OK.Self-harm is just one of a long list of illnesses on the increase among young people: add depression, anxiety, insomnia, anorexia, along with staples like lethargy, listlessness and nihilism and it’s a pretty distressing picture of the world they can inhabit. And landing them with the responsibility to sort out our mistakes before they are old enough to have made a few of their own is not the answer.When I see the Bambi-like figure of Greta Thunberg on the world stage, I find myself guilty about the world they’re being fast-forwarded into. The bottom line is that world affairs can be crushing at a time when an unrequited crush on the boy next door is barely survivable. It’s certainly not the best age at which to be exposed to global woes without support. Keeping things in proportion for your daughter and expanding on the subjects the two of you talk about is essential.While sustainable behaviours can never be adopted too soon it’s also vital she’s allowed to be frivolous. The greatest gift we can give our offspring is a childhood that is not overburdened with responsibility, which means we need to act like the grown-ups. Currently, for all the reasons I’ve just outlined, our children are shouldering global issues that the smartest brains on our planet struggle with. But life is still worth living because, even in the worst of times, there is joy to be found. Try changing your morning radio station – Chris Evans brings a welcome blast of irrepressible enthusiasm to the day – and find activities with your 13-year-old that are just for fun, because when you can’t see the wood for the trees it’s pretty hard to let that sunshine in.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

The presenter was found dead on Saturday.In the now-deleted story, the Sun highlighted the card mocking the alleged assault of her boyfriend Lewis Burton in December.The “exclusive” story about the card quoted the card illustrator, Samuel Hague, who said his latest creation has been left “blank inside for your personal message” and comes with a “good quality red envelope”.When asked about the card, he said: “There’s nothing I wish to add. I’m surprised that’s the card you choose to write about. I’ve joked about far worse.”Love Island has attracted substantial press coverage for the aftercare support given to it contestants, after two people who had previously taken part in the hit ITV2 show killed themselves. The channel has insisted that these deaths happened long after the iniduals were on the show.Love Island has proved to be a financial cash cow for the broadcaster which last summer made clear it would provide substantial aftercare support to those who take part in the programme.Flack was due to host Love Island’s first winter edition, which is currently being broadcast from Cape Town in South Africa, but was replaced at the last minute by Laura Whitmore.After being charged with assault, Flack was forced to stay away from her boyfriend and had severely limited her social media output.On Saturday afternoon the Sun’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, paid tribute to Flack: “Caroline was hung out to dry by ITV. She was distraught they didn’t stand by her. And distraught about the lack of support she was given. Caroline and I were devastated to attend the funeral of our friend Mike Thalassitis last year. I cannot believe we are here again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f81c64841309c1cfe7207c157e0068c174bcf8/406_353_3267_1960/master/3267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c253b97e0a7c184a0fbf1b944b70d5f","title":"fran unsworth bbc election coverge licence fee","story":"Fran Unsworth claims row over impartiality was ‘a Brexit thing’ and frank debate is needed over broadcaster’s roleThe BBC was taken aback by leftwing attacks on its general election coverage, Fran Unsworth, the broadcaster’s head of news and current affairs, has admitted in a frank assessment of the political pressures that are undermining efforts to preserve the licence fee.Unsworth, 62, said attacks on BBC standards of impartiality from sections of the political left, as well as from rightwingers, “was a Brexit thing”. “When you get a binary referendum choice that re-frames politics, people take sides in a way that they don’t in normal times,” Unsworth said.Describing the latest government warnings about future funding of the corporation as “a serious threat”, Unsworth said: “We tend to get caught up in the maelstrom. If people don’t see their own ‘truth’ expressed, then they see it is an untruth. And social media now means that narratives can take hold that are not based in fact.”Unsworth was speaking out after the appointment last week of Oliver Dowden as secretary of state for culture and the arrival of Julian Knight as the chair of the parliamentary committee that scrutinises the BBC. Both are promising to question the broadcaster’s reliance on income from the licence fee.Criticism from those on the left who detected a rightwing prejudice in the BBC’s election coverage was a surprise, she admitted. But Unsworth rebutted claims that the attacks had been caused by a deliberate BBC attempt to avoid more conventional accusations of liberal bias inside New Broadcasting House. There had been no over-correction: “We just carried on doing what we were doing.”Unsworth said she thought renewed hostility from the new Conservative government was unlikely to win back alienated former BBC support on the left.“People are quite entrenched in their views on this, I think. We have just got to keep restating our case that we will listen to everybody, serve everybody and host everybody, but not be bullied by either side. We don’t get it right all the time, obviously, and people can be unhappy with what we do, and that is fine.”The former World Service boss, who also has a seat on the BBC board, made her case for the defence following public arguments made last week by Sir David Clementi, her chairman, and Tony Hall, the director general, who both underlined the breadth of service the BBC can offer because of its licence fee income.Unsworth said that in the run-up to the renewal of the terms of the BBC’s charter in seven years’ time, there was always bound to be a national debate, whatever the government.“But all this talk about the future of the licence fee really should start with discussion about what the BBC is for,” she said. “Once you have answered that, you can go on to how it should be funded.”Switching to a subscription payments would be unfair, Unsworth argued, because those willing to pay would end up funding a service that is still obliged to try to inform and reach the entire British public, according to its charter terms.“This is where the whole subscription model starts to come adrift. If you have a national civic function, you cannot then choose for only certain sections of the audience to pay for it,” she said.Unless the charter is radically altered in 2027, the BBC’s “universal mission” in not a consumerist one, but a key duty to keep the people informed, she argued. “Under our charter, the job is to provide impartial news without fear or favour, and not to be beholden to commercial or political interests.”The BBC’s “civil contingency” function is also in danger of being forgotten, Unsworth believes. Aside from providing news – “public purpose number one” – the broadcaster must offer guidance in case of national emergency. She had recently witnessed this working in Australia, she said, when ABC regional radio services were relied upon during the power cuts caused by dangerous bushfires.After two years in the top news job, Unsworth is now meeting criticism from inside her own organisation. High pay levels among senior staff – her salary is in the “up to £249,000” bracket – have prompted censure as 450 job cuts were announced last month across reporting teams. She and her colleagues accept this level of scrutiny, she said. “It is fair that the BBC gets more attention, because we should be better than others. It is hard, but fair enough.”Her restructured, or slimmed-down, news service will be trialled next month, Unsworth said, explaining that it is designed to stop duplication and to give BBC reporting greater impact across all its channels, websites and radio stations. It will also make required budget savings.She sees the gender pay gap scandal as “a running sore”, she added, describing it as “a legacy of yesteryear”. Journalists Samira Ahmed, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague were among those who found they were paid less than male counterparts. “We have to work through all this and put structures in place that avoid us getting into this mess again.”Julian Knight said this weekend that criminalising those who do not buy a television licence but use the BBC is out of date: “When we’re looking at a world of populism, a world in which elites are being challenged an awful lot, the idea of criminal sanctions over the licence fee sticks in a lot of people’s throats.” But Unsworth regards such attacks as a conflation of two separate debates – one about the decriminalisation of this offence, the other about the fairness of the licence fee. She cited the words of John Bache, national chair of the Magistrates Association, who earlier this month told Today programme listeners that a change “would make an insignificant difference” to levels of court congestion.Another irritation for Unsworth is the growing assumption that the BBC has lost its youth audience due to technological changes. In fact, she argues, this has not happened yet and a good percentage of young people still watch news broadcasts such as BBC One’s six o’clock bulletin, which has pulled in audiences of more than 5 million since Christmas.“We do see a slide in linear TV and radio consumption in the under 35s, it’s true,” she said. “And those behaviours will probably be extended to the under 55s eventually, which is why we really have to think hard about ways of reaching them. But it really is not a crisis.”When Hall’s replacement is selected by Clementi this summer, they must champion all these arguments, and more. Yet Unsworth still believes the BBC’s best defence will come from its listeners and viewers: “Our real value lies in audience appreciation of what we do, rather than us simply banging the drum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95969ba0c659daed958030cd9abaf31cab44332a/785_731_5070_3042/master/5070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39e5addfdb5f10807fd5b03fba2c451c","title":"the former addicts saving lives with naloxone podcast","story":"Anti-overdose drug naloxone has been in clinical use since the 1970s but not always where it’s needed most. ’s Jamie Grierson visited Redcar in North Yorkshire where a group of former drug users provide at-risk people with kits that could save their lives.

Meanwhile, anxiety grew among MPs from different wings of the party over its future direction.At a leadership hustings in Glasgow, held the day after shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry was eliminated from the contest, Starmer said he “saluted” Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy.But the bookies’ clear favourite declined to invite either of them into his top team. “I don’t think any of us are going to get into jostling for positions on this,” Starmer said.In response, Long-Bailey said: “I feel a bit sad that Keir doesn’t want us in his shadow cabinet. I know we don’t agree all the time, and our visions are probably very different, but we meet on areas of common ground, and that’s what would make us a strong shadow cabinet and I would have Keir and Lisa in my shadow cabinet.”Nandy indicated that she would also welcome both rivals to serve under her, saying she would be “proud to serve alongside these two”.Thornberry was knocked out of the contest after failing to reach the necessary threshold of support from local parties or Labour affiliates.At a deadline of midnight on Friday, she had 31 nominations from local constituency parties, two short of the 33 needed, and had failed to receive any nominations from affiliates. Starmer, Long-Bailey and Nandy had already met the requirement to get on to the ballot papers, which will go out to party members in the next few days.Starmer’s remarks came, as behind the scenes, MPs from the right and left of the party advanced their own demands for a new shadow cabinet.Critics of the Corbyn project said that if the next leader did not signal a clear departure from the recent past by placing figures such as Yvette Cooper, Hilary Benn and Rachel Reeves in key posts, then Labour would have “learnt nothing” from its disastrous election defeat in December.This wing would like to see Cooper as shadow home secretary, Reeves as shadow chancellor, and Benn as shadow foreign secretary. “If we do not make these kinds of appointments under Starmer or whoever it is, then we are saying we do not want to win elections, full stop,” said one former minister.But leftwing MPs sympathetic to Corbyn were also flexing their muscles, saying that if Corbynites like Long-Bailey are excluded members will rise up in protest. “They will not put up with a move back to New Labour and centrism,” said one MP. “We will have a party that is completely ided again between the majority of the parliamentary party and the majority of the membership.”Throughout the contest, Starmer has pitched his campaign to the left in order not to alienate members, who have the final say. But another MP said: “The question is, if Starmer wins, what will he do then? Who he appoints to the shadow cabinet will be the first big signal.”At yesterday’s hustings, Long-Bailey was the only remaining candidate who would grant the Scottish parliament legal powers to hold a second independence referendum, saying that to refuse this “would drive more of our voters into the arms of the Scottish National party”.Starmer did not rule out the possibility, saying: “It is an interesting question, but we shouldn’t get sucked into that. The SNP are constantly using the constitutional issue to mask other issues.”But Nandy reinforced her opposition to another independence referendum saying: “We have to stand up for Scotland remaining in the UK, and for solidarity across the nations and regions of the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7a9ded08a315ff1578551cf2ef0e048b7c4658a/453_19_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e1b10da4b03cc73dd0e408da7520447","title":"mary lou mcdonald violent dissident republicans should disband","story":"Violent dissident republicans should disband, the leader of Sinn Féin has said. Anti-peace process renegades threatened the party’s vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, and veteran policing spokesman Gerry Kelly after they supported a recent recruitment campaign for new Catholic officers.The party’s president, Mary-Lou McDonald, said they would not be deterred or intimidated by the gunmen. She added: “These people have no politics, no strategy and nothing to offer. They are at war with their community and are now threatening political representatives who serve the people.”The event was intended to encourage more Catholics to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Senior commanders have become concerned about a slide in the proportion of Catholic officers amid the threat posed by dissident republicans who try to kill members of the security forces.The Sinn Féin president said: “Sinn Féin will not be deterred or intimidated. These groups have nothing to offer. It’s time they packed up and disbanded.”O’Neill and Kelly’s attendance at a PSNI recruitment event was hailed by the chief constable, Simon Byrne, as “seismic and historic”. It was the first time such a senior Sinn Féin figure had attended such a meeting, although the party has expressed support for police in Northern Ireland on many occasions in the past.Last year there were attempted bomb attacks by dissident republicans targeting police in Belfast, Craigavon in Co Armagh and near the Irish border in Fermanagh. The New IRA and Continuity IRA are involved.Police have described as “cruel and disgusting” anti-PSNI recruitment posters depicting an officer who was severely injured in a bomb attack. The posters used a picture of Peadar Heffron along with a warning that anyone thinking of joining the police could suffer similar injuries. Heffron lost a leg when a dissident bomb detonated under his car near Randalstown in 2010 as he travelled to work. He now uses a wheelchair.Meanwhile, McDonald commended her negotiating, Executive and Assembly teams – led by O’Neill – for “working hard for citizens”. She listed recent successes following the restoration of devolved political powersharing at Stormont.She said: “Already in the executive we have seen measures taken to tackle poverty, including moving quickly to end the nurses’ dispute of equal pay extending welfare mitigations and a new housebuilding programme has been announced. Additional funding has been made available for education, and the victims and survivors of the contaminated blood scandal in the north will receive compensation payments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8d221a23c6b0d0228b9bb72377da578729b90d1/0_111_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e01c1fdfce504a109c757b59257c015","title":"labour candidates called on to justify transphobia claims","story":"Labour leadership candidates who signed a pledge calling several organisations “trans-exclusionist hate groups” are facing demands to produce evidence for the allegation.A row over a pledge card drawn up by the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights group broke out last week after Rebecca Long-Bailey, Emily Thornberry and Lisa Nandy, as well as deputy leadership candidates Angela Rayner and Dawn Butler, all expressed support for the charter. It calls on Labour to expel “transphobic” members, and describes campaigns including Woman’s Place UK as “trans-exclusionist hate groups”.Woman’s Place UK has now written to the leadership figures demanding to see the evidence behind the claim. The group has also written to the candidates who have not signed the pledge, asking to meet them to discuss the growing row. It said none of the candidates had yet replied.The Labour Campaign for Trans Rights pledge states that the party has “failed to act as transphobia has gained ground” within the party. It said last week it was “heartened by the solidarity” of the Labour candidates. It reiterated its view that Woman’s Place UK perpetuated discrimination against trans people. It is the latest development in a growing row within the party. Woman’s Place UK is pushing for ministers to consult more widely about changes to the Gender Recognition Act, which would allow people to legally self-identify as a man or a woman without medical approval.It rejects accusations that it is transphobic and trans-exclusionist. Its founders say it aims to “ensure that women’s voices are heard and our sex-based rights upheld”. However, critics say it is trying to limit the rights of trans people.In a letter to Lisa Nandy, Ruth Serwotka, a Woman’s Place UK founder, wrote: “I hope you understand that expulsions of women from the party on the grounds you are suggesting (and being cavalier about evidence) will provoke a huge backlash. It will be fiercely opposed by all fair-minded members, who insist on reason and evidence.“In fact, we are a women’s rights organisation committed, among other things, to upholding current sex discrimination and equality law as set out in the Equality Act (2010), including upholding protections for trans people”.Nandy’s team declined to comment. The government has delayed publication of its long-awaited decision on changes to the Gender Recognition Act."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/187dc866be54a02dc4bfdb1c76a1dbf019826da3/37_0_4511_2706/master/4511.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b2545dd93f639177f7af1a04985e63","title":"sinn fein election success tainted past","story":"Despite its success in the Irish elections, the party is still tainted by association with crimes committed during the TroublesO land of password, handgrip, wink and nod,Of open minds as open as a trap,Where tongues lie coiled, as under flames lie wicks,Where half of us, as in a wooden horse,Were cabin’d and confined like wily Greeks,Besieged within the siege, whispering morse.In the poem Whatever You Say, Say Nothing, Seamus Heaney immortalised the code of discretion, of the silences, winks and nods that defined the Troubles.The family of Jean McConville, a Belfast mother of 10 who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1972, has spent almost five decades trying to crack the omertà. It is an ongoing struggle – and Sinn Féin’s triumph in Ireland’s general election last weekend suggests time is not on the family’s side.McConville’s name did not feature in the campaign. And Gerry Adams, the Sinn Féin figure most associated with the case, stood down as a TD (MP), distancing the party from awkward questions.“Ignore the problem and it’ll go away, that’s the strategy,” said Seamus McKendry, who is married to McConville’s daughter Helen and is an outspoken campaigner on the case.Adams resigning as party leader in 2018, and now exiting the Irish parliament, helped pave the electoral breakthrough, said McKendry. “The best thing the Sinners ever did,” he said, using a nickname for Sinn Féin. “With him out of the road it was easier to vote for Mary Lou McDonald and other candidates.”Outside Ireland, Sinn Féin is best known for having been the IRA’s political wing during the Troubles, but at home it has reinvented itself as an Irish version of the Spanish party Podemos or the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic party.On the promise of cheaper housing, better healthcare and more public spending, it won a quarter of the popular vote – almost double its tally in the 2016 general election – and 37 seats in Dáil Éireann, making it a contender for power for the first time. No party gained a majority in the Dáil, so talks are under way to form a coalition. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, Ireland’s two big centrist parties, have ruled out governing with Sinn Féin, raising the spectre of stalemate and another election.When it comes to her party’s fraught legacy, McDonald, 50, a Dubliner who succeeded Adams as leader, has not been able to say nothing.During the campaign the murder of Paul Quinn, a young man beaten to death by alleged IRA members in 2007, returned to haunt the party and tripped up McDonald in a televised debate.David Cullinane, a newly elected TD, caused a row last week by shouting “Up the ’Ra”. McDonald responded by saying that she had urged party members not to make “throwaway comments”. She added: “I’m not their mammy. I don’t censor them either. We’re all adults and I do expect them to behave in an adult way.”The Troubles, in other words, are still politically troublesome. Many Sinn Féin members believe the media stirs up old ghosts to discredit the party’s redistributive economic policies. Last week Enda Fanning, a senior party official, said an RTE radio show had “denigrated” Sinn Féin representatives. “It really needs to be addressed by a new government and a proper monitoring authority with powers introduced to prevent such political bias,” he tweeted.In Northern Ireland, in contrast, Sinn Féin revisits the Troubles by backing legacy investigations into Bloody Sunday and other killings of Catholics and nationalists. Unionists accuse the party of “weaponising” the past for political gain.Supporters south of the border, meanwhile, especially young supporters, focus on the party’s solutions to homelessness, soaring rents and hospital waiting lists. They shrug off the Troubles.“When we went knocking on the doors it didn’t come up,” said Mark Ward, who was elected in the Dublin Mid-West constituency. “People have moved on. What concerned them was infrastructure, housing, health, having less money in your pocket at the end of the week.”A new generation had come of age since the 1998 Good Friday agreement, said Deaglán de Bréadún, author of Power Play: The Rise of Modern Sinn Féin. “The past is always present … but officially the IRA hasn’t been active since 1997. That’s 23 years – a lot of voters wouldn’t have been born then, or were too young at the time to remember it now.”When recalling IRA activities, Sinn Féin tended to focus on hunger strikers rather than, for instance, the bombers who tried to blow up Margaret Thatcher, said De Bréadún. As leader, McDonald has to play down the paramilitary legacy without irking the republican base, he said.“The problem is that, if she goes too far and puts too much distance between herself and the ‘struggle’, she might alienate veterans of that era. So a little bit of republican rhetoric is probably no harm at times.” He reckons she is unlikely to repeat the old IRA slogan tiocfaidh ár lá (“our day will come”), which she used to close a party conference in 2018.The family of McConville, meanwhile, wonder if or when their day will come.A former Belfast IRA commander, Brendan Hughes, claimed before his death that Adams gave the order that McConville be killed and “disappeared” over suspicion, since discredited, that she was an informer.An IRA team dragged the widow from her screaming children, shot her and buried her at a beach in county Louth, south of the border. Not wanting blame for creating 10 orphans, republicans spread a rumour McConville had abandoned her children and moved to England with a British soldier.Pressed by campaigners, the IRA admitted the murder in 1999. A dog walker stumbled across her remains in 2003. Adams has consistently denied any knowledge of the murder or being in the IRA. An attempt to link him to the murder based on the trial of Ivor Bell, an IRA commander, failed when the case collapsed last year.McKendry, McConville’s son-in-law, said he glimpsed Sinn Féin’s ascent in 2011 when he lobbied voters in Louth – in vain – to reject Adams, who was standing in the constituency. They told him they didn’t care about Adams’s past. “I found it incredibly hurtful.”McKendry shared voters’ sentiment to shake up Irish politics, but wished they had chosen another agent of change. “I can understand the younger ones, they didn’t live through the war, but people of my age coming out and voting for Sinn Féin, I despair.”The irony of Sinn Féin’s rise as the party of the future is its vexed relationship to its own past, said Patrick Radden Keefe, author of Say Nothing, a 2018 investigative book about McConville’s murder.“They’ve never been able to rebut, in a remotely credible way, testimony that the party’s long-time leader ordered one of the most notorious war crimes of the Troubles. But rather than confront that legacy head-on, I think the strategy has been to keep banging on about other issues in hopes that, with the passage of time, the McConville case will come to feel like ancient history to voters and they’ll forget. If these election results are any indication, the strategy seems to be working.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/140c55a8215f0e125387a339e5bce48065fe02d8/0_114_2888_1733/master/2888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10cb2f66ac7943bfe028e250a3716209","title":"sir menzies campbell backs britons bid to avoid extradition to us","story":"Former Lib Dem leader opposes attempt to try former boss of Autonomy on criminal chargesFormer Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has thrown his weight behind former Autonomy boss Mike Lynch in his battle to avoid extradition to the US on fraud charges.Campbell, a QC, said UK citizens are at a significant disadvantage when they attempt to fight US extradition requests, because they have to meet a different standard of proof compared with Americans whose extradition is requested by the UK.Campbell believes US prosecutors “over-egg” indictments against UK defendants so they can work towards a plea bargain, and says the costs of fighting extradition can be prohibitive as in the US “there is no legal aid system, such as we would understand”.Lynch is currently awaiting the judgment in his £3.8bn civil fraud case, relating to the acquisition of his company Autonomy by Hewlett-Packard for £8.4bn in 2011.He submitted himself for arrest earlier this month as part of the US’s attempt to extradite him to face criminal charges. If he was found guilty, he would face a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Lynch denies any wrongdoing and has been released on £10m bail.Campbell is not working for Lynch but has been a vocal critic of the US-UK extradition treaty, and has intervened several times in previous high-profile extradition cases.In 2006, he was asked to help Gary Mulgrew, one of the so-called NatWest Three. Mulgrew and two other British former NatWest bankers failed in their attempts to avoid extradition, and were later sentenced to 37 months in a US jail for a complex fraud related to the 2001 collapse of US energy giant Enron.The former lawyer believes the US request for Lynch’s extradition has come too soon, before the judgment in the Autonomy founder’s civil case is handed down. However, if the judge finds in Lynch’s favour, “it could well be a powerful argument against extradition”, said Campbell.Lynch is challenging his extradition using a “forum bar”, which allows British courts to block an extradition if they believe it is in the interests of justice for the defendant to stand trial in the UK. The legal process is expected to last until the end of the year.Campbell believes the decision made in 2012 by then home secretary Theresa May to block the extradition of computer hacker Gary McKinnon, diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, on human rights grounds, has led to the US making more extradition requests: “My clear impression is that the Americans are playing hardball on this.”Campbell believes this can also be seen in the US refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat charged with killing 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn in a road collision in Northamptonshire in 2019.Campbell has campaigned for more than a decade for a change in the law, which critics say is stacked against British citizens.However, as the UK eyes a post-Brexit free trade deal with the US, he is no longer optimistic.“I don’t think we are in a position to bring about change,” he said. “United Kingdom are supplicants in any argument or any negotiation about trade and annoying the Americans might be thought to have potentially adverse consequences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband.

Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address.

A group of men and women, young and old, are learning the art of writing an obituary. Their own obituary.None of them is at death’s door – in fact, most are in fine shape – but the workshop’s organiser, Sarah Farr, has asked them to think what their obituary might look like if, let’s say, they were run over by a bus tomorrow.Obituary workshops, as they are known, have taken hold across America, the latest incarnation of the “death positivity” movement, which aims to stamp out “death denial” by forcing people to think about dying while they are still alive.The idea of writing his own obituary terrified Bob Hoffman, who for years has struggled with his fear of death. Yet something about putting pen to paper, and the sense of control it gave him, began to turn that pain into pleasure. “Hoff has transitioned to the next adventure,” he starts his obituary. “After many years of ‘end-of-life’ preparation, Hoff is now exploring the best ways to continue his energy and spirit in a new realm.”Now on a roll, Hoffman leaves well-wishers a list of places to visit his ashes – Washington DC, New York and Vermont are among the more scenic options on a list of 13 possible day trips. But he reminds them: “Whenever you desire, simply think of him – because he will still be with you.”Back in the land of the living, 74-year-old Hoffman says he relished the idea of defining his own legacy before someone else beat him to it. It also helped him get over his dread of the unknown. “I thought of death as an empty hole of black nothingness – it put me into a very negative mind-set,” he says.Choosing what he wants to be remembered for, and attending death cafes – where likeminded customers chat about mortality over coffee and cake – have forced him to think about dying in a more positive way, he says. “It’s giving me a lot of late-life pleasure,” he says.Thinking about your death can really help you get clear about your life, agrees Farr, a trained death doula.“It’s a hard thing to do but the idea is to see where your pen and paper take you, and run with it,” she says.Farr sets the group another exercise: to write what she calls a “fantasy obit” – the death notice they would like to see written about themselves if they live a full life, imagining all the things they are yet to achieve.“What it comes down to is that society will be better if we have frank, open conversations around death,” says Caitlin Doughty, the founder of the death positivity movement, in a phone call from her Los Angeles funeral home. “Everybody’s thinking about death all the time – it’s the preoccupation of universal human experience”, she says. “The goal isn’t about not being scared of it – the goal is to grow awareness through education.”Those sentiments resonate with retired hospice nurse Barbara Wagner, one of those at the Washington workshop. “It’s helped me find a way to look at my bumpy life in a humorous way,” she says. “It feels freeing and cathartic and just joyful.”Wagner describes in her obituary how she married high school sweetheart Buzz and had two children by the age of 21. “When Buzz got a motorcycle and rode off with the Hells Angels at the age of 22, Barbara was called to re-consider her life – an act she did regularly from then until her death last week at age 100.”“There’s not much fantasy in there, it’s mostly true,” she says.The workshops are not just attracting older people. In fact, Farr says, people in their 20s and 30s are the fastest growing group.One of them, Rachel Wynn, a social media entrepreneur, believes that younger people are more open than their parents’ generation to talking about death.In part, she thinks, this is because there’s so much exposure to death on social media she remembers, for example, the shared online grief with friends when actor Heath Ledger died in 2008.Writing her own obituary has been an epiphany, she believes, because, despite being only 30, it made her feel that she hadn’t achieved enough in her life. “It was like, wow, I really need to get my shit together,” she says.Wynn has even gone to the next extreme and attended a workshop where she “went to her own funeral”. She recalls having to lie down on a blanket cut into the shape of a coffin, while a shroud was placed over her body and a beanbag over her eyes.“That was intense,” she says. “It was like we really had died and were being buried.”“It’s like a harsh wake-up call. Are you living the life you’re happy with?” she says. “Because you could die any minute.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7acddf608fcf1c2ae6c95c0d91407b3103c5afe3/0_125_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ccadbff4377a8290bc8429342adcd7d","title":"laura muir athletics jemma reekie","story":"Laura Muir has been the undisputed queen of British middle distance for years. But after falling short in a world record attempt over 1,000m at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow she admitted a cold, hard truth: she now shares her throne with her young training partner Jemma Reekie.On a day when Mondo Duplantis broke the world pole vault record for the second time in a week, the 21-year-old Reekie again showed off her devastating kick, emerging from the pack to zoom past the former world indoor silver medalist Dawit Seyaum in the final 20 metres to win the 1500m.And Muir, 26, was clearly impressed. “I think we are very close to being on par,” she said. “Certainly Jemma has got the speed and I have got the endurance. I would probably give her the 800m and me the 3,000m and 5,000m. But at the 1500m we are very, very close. It’s really exciting at training. We’re pushing each other.”Muir had been hoping to break Maria Mutola’s 1,000m world record of 2:30.94 but she was always off the pace needed and finished in 2:33.47 – a time that still admittedly beat Adelle Tracey by more than four seconds.Meanwhile, Reekie’s victory in the 1500m early on in the day capped a remarkable fortnight in which she has shot from relative obscurity to Olympic contender.Two weeks ago at this Arena, Reekie smashed the British indoor 800m record in 1min 57.91sec – shattering her personal best by nearly four seconds and setting the fastest time indoors by a woman since 2006. Last week, for good measure, she also broke the British indoor 1500m and mile record in a race in New York.She had been hoping to break the 1500m again but in a more tactical race she showed another side to her talents by sprinting to win in 4:04:07. “There were a few points I had to get my elbows out,” admitted Reekie. “But that’s middle-distance running. I’m still learning but I’ve got a lot more to give. I was hoping I was going to beat my own British record,” she added. “But that’s OK. I’ll take the win.”But Reekie also found herself having to defend her startling improvement and responded to questions for the first time about her controversial Nike spikes. “It doesn’t happen overnight and there’s a lot of hard work,” she told the BBC. “I am 21-years-old and I am a developing athlete and I am pushing myself to the absolute limits and I will just let my legs do the talking.”Meanwhile the most surprising performance of the day was from full-time primary school teacher Jessie Knight, who set a stadium record with victory in the women’s 400m. The 25-year-old from Epsom combines a full-time job with training six days a week but showed plenty of strength to win in 51.57s – the third fastest time of the year so far.“I got a stadium record and being on that start list, on paper I should have been last,” a bemused Knight said afterwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ef40d6aa37d2bb12834e81850b7a015674ac7fd/0_184_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=354dde1e5b847b7d0969cf3322d54c91","title":"farrells collide england clash ireland","story":"It has been four years since the Farrells first squared off against each other. Andy took over as Ireland’s defence coach in 2016 and ever since, whenever the Six Nations rolls around, he has had to drill his team in how to best stop England’s current captain, and playmaker, his son Owen. So far they are even-stevens, with two wins each, but this year it is a little different, that much sharper, because Andy has taken over as Ireland’s head coach. It is a game of father-son ping-pong, played out in front of a crowd of tens of thousands, a family ding-dong on live TV, a relationship, a rivalry, unlike any other in sport.And before Andy’s Ireland face Owen’s England at Twickenham next Sunday, they are not talking about it.Which figures. Because while the family dynamic seems endlessly fascinating to everyone else, the Farrells themselves are bored rigid by our questions. And besides, they have both been around the game long enough to know that there is not a lot to be gained from discussing it in public. “Honestly, I’ve not even thought about it,” said Andy after his Ireland team beat Wales in Dublin last weekend. Over in Edinburgh Owen, too, got asked. “Every time we’ve played Ireland since my dad’s been there I’ve been asked questions about that,” he said. “I can’t see this being too different.” And no, it doesn’t make any difference that his dad is head coach, whatever the rest of us think. “We’re just trying to do our job.”Well, you would need a coping mechanism, wouldn’t you? And family therapy can be awfully expensive. The Farrells came up with theirs a long time ago. They keep everything strictly compartmentalised. One could see it in 2008, when Owen made his debut for his father’s club, Saracens, in a pre-season friendly against Western Force. They were both on the bench. Andy got on first. Then he broke a bone and had to come off. He was replaced by his son. “He wasn’t bothered about my injury,” Andy said afterwards. “I couldn’t really think about anything else other than my job,” Owen explained. “I just had to get out here and do my job.”Spoken like a true pro. Which is just how Andy raised him. Owen was always around the training pitch, and the changing room, at Wigan and Saracens, watching, learning, while his father won all those matches and medals. Andy was so young when he became a father at 16 that people who know them both say they sometimes seemed as much like brothers as they did father and son.Back then they were not so bored with talking about all this, opening up about their relationship in an interview with World Rugby. “We’re very competitive, yeah,” Andy said. “He says he never lets me win but I always win anyway,” Owen chipped in. “Nah,” Andy contradicted him. “He never wins anything. Even playing tiddlywinks tomorrow I would never let him win. But I think it’s getting to that stage though now where I have to be on my toes.” Owen grinned at him: “It was at that stage five years ago”. Andy shot back: “No it was not!”They say the 44-year-old Andy is the better golfer, Owen the better table tennis player and that neither is willing to admit being worse at either. As for who is the better rugby player, there is nothing between them. If Andy has an idea of weakness in Owen’s game, do not think for a minute that he would hesitate to exploit it because, if Owen sees a weakness in how Andy would set up his team, he would do exactly the same. That is the job.There really is nothing else quite like it. There are plenty of fathers and sons who played the same sport, a few who worked together on the same teams, sometimes as players, sometimes as coaches, but there are not so many who have come up against each other.In football Noah Gunnar Solskjær made his professional debut in a friendly against his father’s team last summer, when Kristiansund played Manchester United in a friendly, and in the NFL, the Denver Broncos’ head coach Mike Shanahan used to square off against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where his son, Kyle, was as an assistant coach for the offence.But the closest parallel is in the NBA, where Doc Rivers, head coach of the LA Clippers, has to coach his team to play against his son Austin, shooting guard for the Houston Rockets. Just like the Farrells, they used to be on the same team, too, until Austin got traded. And just like the Farrells they don’t see why it’s a big deal. “What’s the difference?” Austin Rivers said. “It’s not special, man.”The Rivers have some fun with it. When the Rockets beat the Clippers 102-93 in Los Angeles last November, Doc blew up at the referees, and Austin started putting his arms together into a “T” and calling for them to hit his dad with a technical foul. They ended up sending Doc off to the stands, Austin burst out laughing, then put his hand to his ear and promised to call him later. “I knew it was coming,” Austin said. “I’ve seen that look before many times. Once he starts blinking his eyes fast, that’s when I know he’s about to level up.”It sounds as though they are one of the few families around who really understand what the Farrells are going through."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8b2a83bfc94039c9d9442dbc9eecf17f4443485/0_97_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8946670c2e4ab6859742497622a05a8","title":"tom pidcock cyclo cross","story":"Cyclo-cross videos do not really go viral – at least not outside of Dutch-speaking Belgium – but there’s one that been doing modest traffic recently. It features the 20-year-old British rider Tom Pidcock at this month’s world championships in Switzerland. When the action starts, he’s surrounded by four Belgian riders in national-team uniform, making it a pleasing echo of the famous Diego Maradona photograph from the 1982 World Cup. But suddenly Pidcock accelerates, weaving in and out of the Aertses and Van Aertses, skimming over the grass and claggy mud like a four-wheel drive set against underpowered automatics. The clip is 11 seconds long, but when it cuts, Pidcock is no longer even in shot. It was filmed on 2 February, and underneath the cycling writer Simon Warren noted: “Britain leaving the EU”.The video reminded me of a Fabian Cancellara attack at Paris-Roubaix in 2010. It’s hard to talk about that sandwich-dropping footage now, because it has been overtaken by claims – in a video watched five million times – that the Swiss rider could only have achieved it with mechanical doping: that he had a motor inside his bike. Suffice to say that cycling has so brutalised its fans, for so long, that no form of cheating would be entirely surprising. But also, there are clearly brilliant, mercurial (and clean) iniduals in the sport who are capable of feats on their bike that make you jump from your sofa. Which, I guess, is why so many of us keep watching the sport.Pidcock, who is from Leeds and whose parents are enthusiastic cyclists, is clearly a young man of outrageous talents. He didn’t go on to win the world championship. First place went to the 25-year-old Dutch polymath Mathieu van der Poel, who has enthralled and confused the cycling world by competing with equal swagger simultaneously in cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing and professional road cycling. Pidcock did, however, finish second. He could have been competing in the under-23s race in Switzerland, which he won last year, but that’s not his style. Instead, he became the first British man to win a medal at the cyclo-cross world championships, an event that’s been held since 1950. “Well I’m no longer u23 world champ,” Pidcock wrote on Twitter. “But I’m now second best in the world. Today feels pretty special.”In an age when, on track and road, British riders have become accustomed to lining up as favourites, cyclo-cross has not really figured. In fact, it might need some introduction. The sport has been called “Tough Mudder for cyclists” and typically has competitors race laps of short courses across grass, sand, mud and gravel. Riders will, at points, have to hoick their bikes – which look similar to road bicycles, but sturdier – over staircases and barriers. It’s all-action (races usually last about an hour) and there is rarely a dull moment for spectators not comments you’d always make about road cycling.Cyclo-cross dates back to the early 20th century and originates from racing cyclists in France wanting to stay fit in the winter (the season runs from September to February). The sport received early validation from Octave Lapize, who gave credit to his cyclo-cross conditioning after he triumphed in the god-awful 1910 Tour de France: “You are murderers,” he screamed at organisers during a seven-summit, 202-mile stage on his single-gear bicycle. “Oui, des assassins.”Since Lapize, though, excelling at cyclo-cross and road cycling has been less than guaranteed, at least among the men. (The Dutch rider Marianne Vos is a multiple world champion in cyclo-cross, on the road and on the track and probably on jelly and basically anywhere you can ride a bicycle.) The diminutive Jean Robic, who won the 1947 Tour de France, also claimed the inaugural cyclo-cross world championships in 1950, but since then there has never been another man who has achieved that double.Today’s road champions, it seems, prefer winter training in sunny Majorca to trudging through the Flanders mud. Meanwhile, cycling has become slick, expensive and data-driven. Could a fearless young tyro like Pidcock be about to shake that up?Pidcock is certainly not short of confidence. He begins a recent promotional video listing his career goals: “I want to win the Tour de France, Roubaix, road worlds, cross worlds, mountain bike worlds, downhill world champs.” From behind the camera, a voice asks if that’s really possible. “No, I don’t think that’s possible,” Pidcock concedes.There’s a little bit of the early-career Mark Cavendish in Pidcock: not in the way he rides, but more in his attitude. The words “cocky” and “arrogant” tend to come up in profiles of Pidcock, but everyone who knows him well insists that’s a misread of what he’s like. That was true of Cavendish, too, certainly when he was starting out. Another similarity is their size. Cavendish was told that he had the wrong body shape to be a professional cyclist Pidcock, whose stats put him at 5ft 2in and 50kg, would probably be the smallest rider in the pro peloton.Pidcock says that he has already had offers from WorldTour teams – the level that Team Ineos races at – but he is not ready to commit yet. Whether he will match the feats of British Tour winners Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas is a long way down the road.But what makes Pidcock so exciting is that he represents a new generation, perhaps a new mindset. His role models are current Tour riders such as Peter Sagan and Julian Alaphilippe, both of whom raced cyclo-cross to a high level as juniors and whose styles are explosive, technical and unpredictable. He aspires to emulate Van der Poel, who can do anything on a bike. At a time when the default is for racers to be pre-occupied by power outputs, there is something thrilling about riders who are instinctive and impulsive and maybe a little unhinged.Riders, in short, who in their first major senior race, find themselves surrounded by a cluster of world-class Belgians and decide to go on the offensive. “Having fun on the bike is the most important thing,” said Pidcock this month. “Nobody is inspired by somebody who is boring, are they?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f467a103bea7a8a6b5be7720b98c31e9fbf430/230_0_5832_3499/master/5832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc73f8041d47af2587f0ddb40b88f5a3","title":"horse marathons roman running 11 great uk adventures","story":"The euphoria of outdoor challenges – mainstream and eccentric – has proved life-changing for our fresh-air enthusiastsIt was completely accidental. Growing up in north-east London, I’d never even heard of the Three Peaks Challenge – entailing people climbing the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales within a 24-hour window. But a friend was doing it for charity and asked if I wanted to join him. Without hesitating, I said yes. I’d recently had a gun pulled on me which misfired – twice. That event helped me make a life-changing decision: to stop trying to fit in and do something that made me happy and was an adventure.I needed to raise £200, but I knew no one in my area would sponsor me – they wouldn’t have heard of it or understood it (I didn’t either), so I waited until I got paid and covered it myself.I found myself on the way to Scotland in a minibus with six others, having done no training, no preparation – my friend had given me a leaflet and told me to check out a website, but I hadn’t had time.We started with Ben Nevis – in clear weather. Going up was hard, but coming down that was really tough. I felt muscles I didn’t even know I had. Scafell Pike, in Cumbria, we did in the dark under thick cloud and mist. By the time we reached Snowdon, it was clear that only two of us would make it – we made a decision that me and another teammate would try to get to the top before our 24 hours was up.At 23 hours and 50 minutes, we made it. It was beautifully clear, with incredible views all over Wales. That was a lightbulb moment and it opened up a whole new world for me – I realised I could do anything I put my mind to.Three years later, after taking part in several marathons, I ended up signing up to trek to the North Pole – becoming the first black Briton to do so. Fast forward another 10 years, and I’ve trekked across the Sinai peninsula, kayaked Jamaica and walked the length of Britain from Dunnet Head to Lizard Point (828 miles) with my teammate Phoebe Smith (see below) to raise money for our own #WeTwo Foundation. It goes to show that once you open your mind to adventure, the possibilities are endless.Dwayne Fields, adventurer, explorer, speakerThe romance of the Man versus Horse marathon grabbed me as soon as I heard about it. Britain’s most eccentric and ruinously tough race was created 40 years ago in the town of Llanwrtyd Wells (20 miles north of Brecon), following an argument in the Neuadd Arms Hotel about whether a human could beat a horse over a long distance if the terrain was tilted (quite literally) in favour of bipeds.I began mountain running immediately, plodding up and over Belfast’s Cave Hill and around the surrounding plateau every chance I had. Training programmes are hard to keep up, but is there anything more inspiring than running through the mountains to race against horses?For me, getting into the hills almost daily was a transformative experience. I loved the solitude, the tangible hilltop targets, the fume-free air and the elevation of mood and outlook that comes from, well, elevation.I was fortunate to be living just a 10-minute jog from Cave Hill country park at the time, which helped, but I was also regularly driving to the Mourne mountains for a wilder, longer session.So even before I arrived in mid-Wales, I felt my life was much the richer as a result of the event. That gratitude, however, faded about three-quarters of the way through.The Man versus Horse is a remarkable race in a stunning Cambrian mountain setting in which competitors run up hill and down dale, through forests and along rivers. The exhilaration of being pursued by horses along bridle paths (runners get a 15-minute head start for safety reasons) is worth the trip alone. But it is also thigh-shreddingly tough, covering 22 miles with more than 1,200 metres of climbing in the (occasional) heat of midsummer. It is not to be taken lightly, and the compulsory veterinary checks at the halfway point are only for the horses.By the end, I was utterly destroyed. But I did manage to beat 36 of the 41 horses that started, and I boast about that to this day. Even more enduring than my boasting, however, is my continued passion for fell running and time spent in the hills. It’s life-enhancing, I promise you, even on two legs.Graham Little, writer and broadcaster from Northern Ireland. The next Man versus Horse marathon is on 13 JuneWater is Snowdonia’s soundtrack. Pause anywhere in the national park and you can hear or see it. As an avid mountain runner intent on chasing the trail, I initially ignored its babbling call. Then I strained my achilles tendon and triggered my metaphorical achilles heel, too.Confined to the sofa, my mood suffered. Ever the nosy journalist, I rested by researching natural highs. The more intensely you exercise, I learned, the more feel-good rewards your brain releases. But quizzing outdoor enthusiasts revealed something interesting in the subjective shadows. Intensity didn’t necessarily mean working harder. British wild swimmers, for example, raved about the “afterglow”. Did the dramatic temperature drop dial up the perceived intensity? I hobbled to a llyn (pool), leapt in and scrambled out, gasping wrong. Then a delicious rosy glow crept over me. I jumped in again.Long runs retriggered my injury, so I began combining short jogs with lake swims for a blast of both worlds. I also read Roger Deakin’s Waterlog, revered as the British wild swimmer’s bible. Inspired by his insight that mountain water courses are some of Britain’s last unwritten places, I began hunting boggy valleys for their mirrors. For motivation, I set myself the goal of swimming in 100 lakes and rivers.At first the water felt shockingly cold but, as winter crept up the mountains, I realised I had acclimatised. My body now felt thirsty for the pure invigoration of cold water.I had regained a lost human sense. Learning to breathe out and accept the cold helped in everyday life, too. We often can’t change a situation, but can change our reactions to it. Increasingly, I left my cares at the water’s edge.Water led me away from paths, as well as from my day-to-day stresses, so I had to tune into the landscape’s contours, boulders and bogs. Running mindfully, I began to notice more: to see wildflowers and hear bird calls.Cupped in mountain bowls, tucked in patches of forgotten Celtic rainforest, Snowdonia’s bodies of water often remain hidden until the last moment, then spring into view as if you’ve been granted the keys to another dimension. A hidden world has opened up to me.Sarah Stirling, a writer who has now logged 90 of Snowdonia’s lakes and rivers on Instagram: @sarah_stirlingGetting in a boat is always an adventure. But trying to carry a kayak or canoe overland is back-breaking. I had looked longingly at the intertwined land and water of north-west Scotland for years before I found the boat to make amphibious adventures possible. A good inflatable packraft can weigh as little as 1.4kg, and roll up smaller than my favourite jumper. It’s possible to walk all day, a paddle strapped to the rucksack, and forget the boat on your back. These tiny inflatables make you selkie-like. You don’t sit on them, but slip into them like clothes: an adventure you can wear.The best use of a packraft is to brush a dramatic landscape against the grain. My first long journey was from Ullapool south to Shieldaig. Between these towns are many peaks separated by long, narrow lochs. The region was once traversed west-to-east by Hebridean cattle drovers and fish traders who provided the protein for Britain’s industrialisation. But to travel north-south is to disobey the laws of geohistory, and doing so by packraft feels like finding a secret passage between the towns.After a night at the glorious Ceilidh Place hotel and bunkhouse, you leave Ullapool by sea. Scramble the rough flanks of Beinn Ghobhlach, then cross the Scoraig peninsula and the “destitution road” on to ridges so prickly it’s a struggle to believe they’re real.Next comes the descent of stupendous 1,062-metre-tall An Teallach, after which you shelter in the shadow of the mountain at the remote bothy of Shenavall. Think of the family who once lived here, cut off from roads all winter. But expect the evening to involve conversation and songs (my last was passed with a couple from Estonia and the retired proprietor of a nearby hotel). Next morning, wade the Strath na Sealga river into ever grander mountain zones.The wonder of this route is that even spectacular Fisherfield (“the great wilderness”) and Loch Maree (“queen of lochs”) are only appetisers. Leave the last peak, the 1,055-metre Liathach, to paddle Lochs Torridon and Shieldaig. Wear the boat suit well and you could glimpse otters, eagles or even a pod of dolphins. End with excellent food at Gille Brighde (Diabaig) or a night at Tigh an Eilean in Shieldaig. You’ll have earned it.David Gange, author of The Frayed Atlantic Edge: A Historian’s Journey from Shetland to the Channel (HarperCollins, £18.99, or £15.95 at  Bookshop)As kids we’re warned of the dangers of wild places. Consider the classic fairytales in which all the bad things happen to those who go off alone into the woods – coming face-to-face with devious wolves and unfriendly bears, or being offered apples laced with poison by strangers. We are conditioned to fear all that lurks “out there”. So it felt like a momentous decision 13 years ago when I chose to take my tent and sleeping bag and head into Snowdonia, alone, to wild camp (illegally, it must be said) by a small lake.My friends thought I was insane – why on earth give up the comforts of the indoors to rough it in the hills and … why alone? But I longed to really experience a place away from the distractions of small talk and to prove – above all – that I really could have an adventure close to home relying on no one but myself.I headed off to the Nantlle Ridge, the range opposite Snowdon, feeling nervous and doubtful of my ability. Suddenly the reassurance that comes from going with a friend – to double-check your navigation, be your safety net if things go wrong and provide a calming voice when you think you hear footsteps outside your tent – was gone. That’s why, after I had located a beautiful camping spot surrounded by jagged peaks and settled down for night alone, only to hear what sounded like an approaching person, I froze. Despite my pre-trip protests, all of the worst possible things people had warned me about – from axe murderers to escaped bears – were now clearly gathering outside my tent.I lay there for several minutes, summoning the courage to look outside. When I finally did, holding my breath, I saw a harmless rabbit, twitching its nose. I exhaled hard, feeling relieved and slightly silly. After that I slept well, and woke the next morning feeling like a new person. I had survived the night and strode out across the hills feeling like I could take on the world. When I got back to my car and caught sight of my sunburned, midge-bitten face in the mirror, I realised there had been a cataclysmic shift in me. The outdoors was now not a place to fear, but the key to all my future adventures – big and small. A door to a world of endless possibilities had opened.Phoebe Smith, broadcaster and author of Extreme Sleeps: Adventures of a Wild Camper (Summersdale, £8.39 at  Bookshop)I was standing on a grass-covered hilltop in Northumberland national park. A dry-stone wall stretched out beside me, rising and falling over green fields until it disappeared into the hazy horizon. It looked like the spine of a sleeping dragon, and was stunning. This is Cawfields, mid-point of the Hadrian’s Wall Path – an 84-mile trail that s northern England from Bowness-on-Solway in the west to the aptly named Wallsend in the east.Having spent the past few years exploring far-flung lands by bike and on foot, I’d made a resolution to do some adventuring closer to home. Armed with the promise of fresh air and fine chat (provided by yours truly), I convinced a friend to run the wall with me, spreading the miles as evenly as we could over four days. And, as a logical next step, we decided to run it dressed as Roman soldiers.Preparation for our journey was less than ideal. Thanks to the chaos of life, we both arrived at the start hideously unfit and recovering from an assortment of minor body niggles. But then again, you never truly feel ready to go on an adventure. You just go anyway.It was a long, hot London summer, many years ago. We had mountain bikes, but these were the days before suspension, and we were looking for a small, accessible adventure. Someone mentioned that a long section of the Ridgeway – the ancient track from the Thames valley into Wiltshire – was rideable, so we cycled to Paddington station with a map, water and sandwiches, heading for Goring in south Oxfordshire with the idea that we could cycle the 35 miles of the Ridgeway to Overton Hill, close to the Avebury stone circle, and get home for tea.It was my first foray into longer off-road rides and bikepacking. I’ve since fine-tuned things a bit, including an off-road trip through the Negev desert, but I’ve returned several times to that first ride on England’s oldest road, dotted with neolithic sites. Easily accessible by train, the ride proper starts near the golf course in Streatley, and is easily doable in a day with a stop at the Red Lion in Avebury before heading over to Swindon for the train back.The ride itself is mainly on good bridle paths shared with walkers and long-distance horse riders, best done on a dry spring day when the hedges are flowering and the bluebells are out. Later in the summer is a good time for wild flowers in the chalk grasslands that mark the western half of the route. The path can be quite rutted, which may require either care or dismounting for some sections. It’s best done on a mountain or gravel bike with chunky tyres to avoid punctures from the flints that dot the path.This route is one of the “old ways” – as Robert Macfarlane might put it – a journey through a landscape made witchy by its evidence of ancient habitation, not least Avebury circle, White Horse Hill and the nearby long barrow at Wayland’s Smithy.There is some water along the way – taps, and troughs for horses – but unless you want to ert from the route for lunch, it is probably better to bring your own along.Peter Beaumont, senior reporter for the There’s a set of sea cliffs near my childhood home in Aberdeenshire named the Bullers of Buchan. Scrambling there for the first time in my 20s made me realise I didn’t have to travel across oceans to feel amazed.I still love it. I can just go to a dicey promontory at dawn, crawl through tufts of grass, along a cliff that appears, by its end, little wider than a horse’s back. Straddling a long rock in the sky, clutching campions, I then wait for clouds of rainbow beaks to emerge all about me.Puffins are shy around people. Perhaps in our shadows they see our ancestors who dashed along high strips of rock like this, seeking out birds’ eggs for sustenance. But I’ve found that if I keep my legs still, I can flap the rest of my body about – unscrewing Thermos lids, munching on biscuits – and the puffins won’t mind. I wait and listen to the waves, the guillemots, the kittiwakes who cry like babies as they drift over the water like sea spray.The first puffin pops out by one of the burrows at my feet. Then there are dozens. They stand and watch the water. They float in the sky like helicopters. Seeing them hover in after a successful fishing trip, beaks gleaming with silver fish, I want to cheer.I’ve been scrambling here for more than a decade now. And when I think of home, I think of Bullers. How it’s changed me. How it was up there that I realised I love birds. And rocks. It was there that I realised home is not boring. There are no boring places at all.Ailsa Ross, author of The Woman Who Rode a Shark (AA Publishing, £14.99, or £12.59 at  Bookshop)I was fed up with my life back in 2011. A city-based, office-centric existence had left me feeling depressed – and in desperate need of deliverance from the mental mire I’d sunk into. So I set myself a physical challenge in the hope that exercise, fresh air and mountain scenery would bring me solace. My self-imposed mission was to climb the Wainwrights, a list of 214 Lake District peaks featured in the seven pictorial guides by Alfred Wainwright. For a novice adventurer, it seemed challenging yet achievable.Wainwright wrote that in Lakeland he discovered “a spiritual and physical satisfaction in climbing mountains – and a tranquil mind upon reaching their summits, as though I had escaped from the disappointments and unkindnesses of life and emerged above them into a new world, a better world”. I was after similar healing and, high in the fells, I found it.It took me more than three years to complete all 214 summits, travelling from my Birmingham home to the Lake District at weekends and during holidays. I loved every minute. Out walking I was happy and free. I found the process of putting one foot in front of the other therapeutic. It cleared my head and put life’s little problems into perspective.From iconic giants like Scafell Pike, Blencathra and Helvellyn, to dinky humps like Cat Bells, Latrigg and Castle Crag, walking the Wainwrights gave me an intimate interaction with the Lake District national park. I ambled sun-drenched valleys, followed dancing becks, glided over sweeping ridges and posed triumphantly on craggy summits. It was a memory-forging, happiness-inducing journey – and one that sparked a lifelong dedication to experiencing more of that “better world”. James Forrest, author of Mountain Man: 446 Mountains, Six months, One Record-Breaking Adventure (Bloomsbury, £16.99, or £14.27 at  Bookshop)My first outdoor rock climb was on Stanage Edge, the long, curled lip of gritstone that overlooks the Hope valley, high above the fringes of Sheffield. It was a route called Flying Buttress, less than 20 metres long, but every move felt precarious, thrilling. I remember the smooth slab at the beginning, how it seemed as if I was trusting my feet on nothing.Climbing teaches you to have faith in your own body and in the surface of the earth. It grounds you, even as you move into the air. Growing up on the edge of the Peak District, I’d always been in awe of climbers, but couldn’t see myself as one. I used to devour books from my bedroom, tales of Alpine daring and Himalayan adventure. Most of them were written by men. All the time, Stanage Edge sat quiet and inviting, a short drive from my house.I made baby steps: teaching myself to climb at the indoor walls in the old foundries of Sheffield, learning to drive, persuading my mum to let me borrow her car. One day, two friends offered to give me my first taste of gritstone. The afternoon we chose was hot, stifling, with a cobalt blue sky that made anything feel possible.Growing up in Limavady, close to the coast of Northern Ireland, gave me easy access to the Atlantic Ocean that generations of my family had explored before me. I learned to surf at an early age, and I have warm memories of time spent on the beach with the sound of crashing waves and the laughter of my family all around me. I caught my first wave at the age of 12 and I vividly remember the exhilarating sensation of walking on water, surrounded by the natural beauty of never-ending strands and the cliffs of Downhill towering over everything. For the first time, I really felt alive.My surfing journey was an extremely happy one, an escape from the world of human pressures, expectations and demands which gave me the ultimate feeling of peace. It only became troublesome when my teachers kept insisting that surfing was merely a hobby and not a career option. But I was determined not to sacrifice my passion for the sea, and I put all my energy into building a business around my lifestyle. I opened my own surf school at the age of 21 with the aim of offering anyone the opportunity to experience the sense of tranquillity and momentary happiness that I had become addicted to.Now I have a team of surf instructors who teach people with visual and hearing impairments, autism, Down’s syndrome as well as a number of wheelchair users. I feel very strongly that nobody should be denied the incredible experience that surfing offers.Dan Laverty runs the Long Line Surf School in LimavadyLooking for a holiday with a difference?

He warned: “If the Franco-German tandem do not come up with a perspective for the middle classes, that will be a historic failure.”Referring to the weakness of the west, Macron admitted he was impatient, if not frustrated, to hear a German response to his call for a strategic dialogue on a more integrated Europe. Asking for a clear answer, he said the countries “have a history of waiting for answers” from each other.“What’s key in the coming years is to move much faster on issues of sovereignty on the European level,” he said.He expanded on his controversial call for Europe to open a strategic dialogue with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, saying the only way to end frozen conflicts, including the one in Ukraine, was for Europe to work with Russia. He insisted: “My position is not pro-Russian or anti-Russian, it is pro-European.”In a reference to the US and the UK, he said: “I hear the defiance of all our partners I’m not mad, but I know that being defiant and weak … is not a policy, it’s a completely inefficient system.“There is a second choice, which is to be demanding and restart a strategic dialogue, because today we talk less and less, conflicts multiply and we aren’t able to resolve them.”Macron said that although the current policy of sanctions and counter-sanctions was not working, he did not advocate they be lifted in the context of Ukraine.He also said he doubted Russia had ended its direct and indirect interference in democratic elections, saying the best response was to defend Europe’s networks and adding: “I do not believe in miracles, but in policies.”Macron confirmed he was willing to lift French objections – he denied it was a veto – to opening EU membership talks with North Macedonia, so long as the EU agreed to the accession process becoming less theological, long-winded and bureaucratic. The bloc’s current review of its accession procedures should do away with the idea that progress to accession was not reversible, he said.Macron was speaking after two leading German politicians affirmed Germany needed to do more to respond to Macron’s offer of dialogue.The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “Germany is ready to get more involved, including militarily.” He called for the “construction of a European security and defence union as a strong, European pillar of Nato”.Europe needed to respond, he said, due to the sudden emergence of a geo-strategic gap to which the continent had closed it eyes.He explained: “The real gamechanger is that the era of omnipresent American global policemen is over. Everyone can see that. It is not due to US lack of military power, but to the commitment of those responsible in the White House.”Decisions on the Middle East were being taken by countries that did not share European values, he said. In Iraq, Libya, Ukraine and the Sahel, Europe “should not cede these crises to those who bring weapons and mercenaries, not peace”, he added.The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on Friday warned that Donald Trump’s “America First” strategy had shaken up the international order and fuelled insecurity in an unstable world.“We are witnessing today an increasingly destructive momentum in global politics,” Steinmeier said, adding: “Every year we are getting further and further away from our goal of creating a more peaceful world through international cooperation.“Under its current administration, the USA rejects the very concept of an international community. Every country, it believes, should look after itself and put its own interests before all others.”Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial but serves as a moral compass for Germany, said Europe needed to take more control of its own security, including through higher military spending.“Only a Europe that is able and willing to credibly protect itself, will keep the US in Nato,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb68c8a896e769e0fd15b5c79913c49d11c34cff/0_89_3427_2055/master/3427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f37b748eb485f85640aa7e77cb915477","title":"coronavirus 70 more cases on japan cruise ship as china infections pass 68000","story":"US, Canada and Hong Kong offer citizens on Diamond Princess flights home as death toll inside China reaches 1,665A further 70 people on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 355, as three countries say they will fly their citizens on the ship home. It comes as China’s National Health Commission announced the death toll inside the country had risen to 1,665, with 68,500 infections.The US embassy in Japan announced on Saturday that more than 400 US nationals would be flown home from the quarantined Diamond Princess, currently docked in the port of Yokohama, south of Tokyo.The US embassy said in a letter to passengers that, based on the high number of confirmed coronavirus cases, passengers and crew members were considered to be “at high risk of exposure”. US charter flights are expected to arrive on Sunday.Hong Kong, which has 330 citizens on board, said it will offer nationals an evacuation flight. The Canadian government also confirmed late on Saturday that it had chartered a plane to bring it citizens who are passengers on the ship home.Canadian passengers who exhibit symptoms of the coronavirus infection will not be permitted to board the flight and will instead be transferred to the Japanese health care system to receive appropriate care, the government said.After arriving in Canada, the passengers will undergo a 14-day period of quarantine, the statement added.The Diamond Princess has been stuck in Japan after a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus.The Australian embassy in Tokyo emailed citizens aboard the cruise ship to say the federal government was also examining options to assist Australians.The embassy told citizens it understood it was a “very stressful” situation for them and that Australian medical officers were working closely with Japanese authorities to support them.The British government has faced mounting pressure to evacuate its citizens, with one passenger, David Abel, who had been livestreaming from the ship, saying on Saturday that he had “given up on anybody in the UK”.Seventy new cases were confirmed on the cruise liner on Sunday according to Japan’s minister of health, labor and welfare, Katsunobu Katoconfirmed, taking the number of cases on the ship over 350.“So far, we have conducted tests for 1,219 iniduals. Of those, 355 people tested positive. Of those, 73 iniduals are not showing symptoms,” Kato said.Passengers have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February, after measures were introduced to try to stop the spread of the disease onboard. The quarantine is due to end on Wednesday, though it is not clear if the emergence of new cases will prompt such restrictions to be extended.There is also growing concern over possible infections among people who disembarked from the MS Westerdam in Cambodia on Friday, after it was confirmed that one passenger, who later flew to Malaysia, tested positive for the virus.The 83-year-old woman flew from Cambodia to Malaysia with 144 others from the ship on Friday. The woman’s husband tested negative for the disease, Malaysia’s health ministry said.The ship’s owner, Holland America, said: “While the first results have been reported, they are preliminary at this point and we are awaiting secondary testing for confirmation.”Cambodian authorities called on Malaysia to review its test results.The ship had been turned away by five countries, despite having no reported sickness on board at the time.Around 68,500 people in mainland China are now confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, and 1,665 people have died from Covid-19, China’s National Health Commission said on Sunday. The figures included a further 142, in the 24-hours to midnight on Saturday, and a further 2,000 new confirmed cases.The daily total of new cases represented a drop for the third day in a row, but researchers have advised caution. The dip in reported numbers follows a spike last week when Hubei province changed the way it was counting cases of the virus. Facing criticism over Beijing’s handling of the outbreak, president Xi Jinping said in a speech reported by state media on Saturday evening that he had given instructions on fighting the disease as early as 7 January. The admission has fuelled questions over why the potential dangers of the virus were not conveyed fully to the public at an earlier date.Most reports of the disease remain concentrated in Hubei, where the outbreak began, but cases have been confirmed across Asia, Australia, the US, Europe and, mostly recently, Africa. Four deaths have occurred outside mainland China – in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.France’s health minister, Anges Buzyn, said: “We have to get our health system ready to face a possible pandemic propagation of the virus, and therefore the spreading of the virus across France.” Her comments followed the death of a 80-year-old Chinese man at a Paris hospital.Robin Thompson, an expert in mathematical epidemiology at Britain’s University of Oxford, said that with nearly 50 cases in Europe, a death was not surprising.“The most important thing to point out, however, is that there still hasn’t been sustained person-to-person transmission in Europe,” he said.

There were no casualties and only minor damage, a US military spokesman said.Agence France-Presse’s correspondents heard multiple strong explosions followed by aircraft circling near the green zone, the high-security enclave where the US mission is located.It was the 19th attack since October to target either the embassy or the roughly 5,200 US troops stationed alongside local forces across Iraq.

Washington responded with retaliatory strikes against a hardline Hashed faction in western Iraq, and days later an American drone strike in Baghdad killed the top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani and his right-hand man, Hashed, deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.Hashed factions have vowed revenge for the pair’s death, insisting US troops should immediately leave Iraq.Sunday’s attack came just hours after one of the Hashed’s Iran-backed factions, Harakat al-Nujaba, announced a “countdown” to ousting American forces from the country.

We’re very supportive of all the women who have testified. It really takes a lot of courage, and it’s painful to see. The lawyers’ disgusting tactics to discredit and humiliate or try to humiliate the women and make it so that we are not believed, it’s awful. It exposes the difficulties women face when they come forward and tell the truth about their abusers.Everyone forgets it’s Harvey Weinstein on trial, not these women. But it’s as if they are the ones who committed these egregious crimes. All they have done is come forward and name their abuser. That’s the worst part, just watching how unfair this is.What do you see as the significance of this trial in the broader fight against Weinstein?A lot of women around the world are looking to this trial, as they did to Christine Blasey Ford. No matter what the outcome is, Harvey Weinstein committed these crimes, and it’s known around the world what he did. These are horrific and egregious crimes.Regardless of the verdict, what do you hope comes next?No matter what happens, this is not marking the end of our fight. We broke our silence, and we are never, ever going to be silent again. We will continue to fight for truth and justice, and we are always going to be here supporting all women. He can go to jail, and it still won’t go away. Some guys are looking for when this is going to end. But this is never ending until sexual assault and violence against women ends.Will you be at the trial in Los Angeles, and what do you think that case will mean for Weinstein?I will be there as much as I can, especially for the women who have to testify. We’re all always there in spirit. I do feel a very strong bond with the women. We’re looking forward to the criminal case we have in LA. There will be different people testifying, different charges. The trials of Harvey Weinstein are in no way, shape or form ending. More than 100 women have come forward, and there are a lot more.I believe there are some Oscar winners who are not able to come forward – women who don’t feel safe or don’t feel comfortable to go through this. And it isn’t easy. There are still people in the industry who feel sorry for Harvey.What do you make of Harvey Weinstein’s lawyer and the narratives she has been presenting about victims and survivors?I don’t know any women who have respect for her whatsoever. What she has done and tried to do is horrible. But at the end of the day, she as a human being will never, ever win this battle. The whole point of doing it is a scare tactic to shut women up, to stop further women from coming forward. They are trying to show women who will testify what it will be like. But we will always have the women’s backs, they know what to expect. It’s not going to work.It’s always been part of the narrative. It’s not new. But we’re seeing it in our face, how they are actually attacking these women. It’s really brave to show his pattern, how he does it, how a victim falls into the trap of assault, and what happens after. People don’t realize the real process of PTSD … When someone has been raped and assaulted, yes, they do stay in touch with their rapists. It plays out in many ways.You’ve been through so much since you first spoke out. What does this moment mean to you?For me, I really want to celebrate and honor the good men that are out there. This is not a witch-hunt. There are incredible men who are feminists who stand beside us. There are great men who we invite to be our allies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68fb76a7c1d0eaea2c534786c1958edd529be142/2487_19_1315_789/master/1315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d15a1520fa87b47161d8d7c6375e3d9c","title":"stressed heads to start brussels budget talks post brexit","story":"Presidents, prime ministers and chancellors across Europe will pack their bags later this week in preparation for a long weekend in Brussels. They won’t, however, be taking in the baroque majesty of the Grand Place or savouring the local culinary treats. Instead, they will be preparing for that most infamous of events, a “four shirter”, to use the clothes-packing gauge adopted by male diplomats to measure the length and horror of EU leaders’ summits in the Belgian capital. The thorny subject this time around? Money. And the problem? Britain.The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union has left a huge €75bn (£62bn) hole in the bloc’s budget for the next seven years, 2021 to 2027. “And now we are fighting like ferrets in a sack,” said one EU diplomat with a sigh.Covering items ranging from agricultural subsidies to science programmes and the EU’s efforts to combat the climate emergency, the new multi-annual financial framework (MFF) needs to be agreed by the leaders and an increasingly unpredictable European parliament before the end of the year. Without agreement, everything risks grinding to a halt in just nine months’ time, including the flow of cohesion funds, the cash dedicated to supporting the poorest member states.Budget discussions in Brussels are always rancorous affairs. But this one is of a different order: everyone will have to pay more. No one wants to. EU capitals are bristling for a fight when they come to Brussels on Thursday for day one. Ominously for the diplomatic corps, an end date for the summit has not been fixed, but four days of talking are on the cards.Then there are the “Friends of Cohesion”. “The Friends of Corruption, you mean?” spat one EU diplomat from a Frugal state.The 15 under the FoC flag are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Croatia, Malta, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Portugal and Greece.The Frugals say that the commission’s €90bn in cuts to agriculture and cohesion funding are not enough. The FoC say they are being unfairly targeted and that the richer countries should cough up some more, setting up a battle between east and west.The debate is all the more toxic as the commission has proposed that cohesion funds should also, in the future, be conditional on member states respecting the rule of law. It is a red rag to the bulls in the nationalist governments of Hungary and Poland, who are already in a battle with Brussels over their judicial reforms, among other issues.Then there is France and Germany. Berlin’s main concern is that they don’t come out of it looking worse than the French. In Paris, the government just worries about how much cash is going to go to its farmers, said one senior EU official. The fragmentation of the national debates leaves it impossible to say what will happen, said a second official, with even Irish politics in turmoil following the election that has made Sinn Féin the second largest parliamentary party.Going in to the summit, the European council’s president, Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, has been engaged in furious shuttle diplomacy around the capitals.“In this negotiation, we are not expecting member states to be happy, but the degree of dissatisfaction will be key,” said a senior EU official. “No chance,” responded a Frugal diplomat. “There is not a lot to say, except we won’t pay. And as the Rolling Stones song goes, ‘Time is on my side’.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4175266.1581776315!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mcdonald accuses martin of arrogance after coalition with sinn f%C3%A9in ruled out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has accused Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin of ‘arrogance’ after he again ruled out entering a coalition government with her party.  Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has accused Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin of “arrogance” after he again ruled out entering a coalition government with her party. In her first speech in Northern Ireland since last weekend’s general election, Ms McDonald told Sinn Féin’s Six County AGM that “the people voted for change”.The election saw Sinn Féin win the largest share of the vote (24.5 per cent) and its candidates secured 37 Dáil seats, one fewer than Fianna Fáil’s total. “Sinn Féin won the election,” Ms McDonald told supporters on Saturday at the Balmoral Hotel in Belfast. Ahead of the speech it was made clear by Sinn Féin’s press department there would be no opportunity for the media to ask questions at the event. Mr Martin and Ms McDonald spoke by telephone on Friday, and he congratulated the Sinn Féin leader on her electoral success before outlining the reasons why his party will not go into coalition with her party.He said Fianna Fáil had a mandate and it was its prerogative and duty to try to form a government. He argued no grouping in the Dáil could force another grouping to form a government when there were such incompatible views on economic policy and other issues.In her speech on Saturday, Ms McDonald said Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were “determined to keep us out of government” and that Mr Martin planned to “deny the people what they voted for”.“That is an arrogant and untenable position, given the strength of Sinn Féin’s mandate,” she said. Matt Carthy, the former MEP who topped the poll in Cavan-Monaghan in last week’s election, opened proceedings by attributing the party’s recent success to Ms McDonald.He said Sinn Féin “is in government in the North” and is ready to do likewise in the State. Standing in front of a banner stating ‘Time for Unity’, Ms McDonald said: “Never again will a general election be pitched as a simple choice between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.“Just as the unionist majority here in the North has gone, the two-party system has been consigned to history”.All-Ireland partyMs McDonald said her candidates had been elected in record numbers on a “people’s manifesto” and noted all 32 counties on the island of Ireland now had a Sinn Féin representative. She claimed Sinn Féin is “the only all-Ireland party resolutely committed to Irish unity”.She attacked the republican credentials of Fianna Fáil, which does not stand for election in Northern Ireland but does have a loose relationship with the SDLP, which only stands for election in the North. “Fine Gael postures as the ‘United Ireland party’ but has no strategy, no programme and no real desire to bring unity about,” she said. “And as for Fianna Fáil, the so-called republican party, Irish unity doesn’t rate a mention in its manifesto’s five core aims.”She accused both of having “no plan, just waffle”.“They cannot block the growing demand around unity,” she added. Ms McDonald also criticised “so-called dissidents” for making threats against Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Sinn Féin’s policing spokesman, Gerry Kelly MLA , for attending a PSNI recruitment event in Belfast. She said those engaged in such threats had “no politics, no strategy and nothing to offer”.“They are at war with their community and are now threatening political representatives who serve the people,” she said.StormontThe section of the speech on the restoration of Stormont gained applause from the audience.Ms McDonald highlighted the need for action on matters in Northern Ireland such as poverty, health, housing and victims’ issues, and stressed “unionists have nothing to fear from Irish unity”.“Of course many of them may see that differently,” she added. “But the answer to that is to talk.”Ms McDonald urged Sinn Féin activists to “keep your shoulder to the wheel” and serve local communities. She ended the speech by saying: “Onwards. Upwards. We can do this. We will do this. We are almost there. And now we will leave and work hard in our communities as proud republicans, as unapologetic united Irelanders.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

As a UK government, we will not be having a border down the Irish Sea.”Mr Lewis was appointed secretary of state on Thursday after the previous incumbent, Julian Smith, was sacked by the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson.He told reporters he was “very fortunate to be coming in as secretary of state off the back of somebody who did a great job and actually delivered, as I say, that agreement”.Mr Smith, he said, had been “a superb secretary of state. I’ve got tough boots to fill and the exciting job of delivering on that agreement.”Mr Lewis visited Queen’s University’s Centre for Security Information Technologies (CSIT) in the Northern Ireland Science Park in Belfast on Friday afternoon, in what was his first trip to the North in his new role.During his first day in office he also spoke by telephone to Tánaiste Simon Coveney, as well as the North’s first and deputy first ministers, DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill, as well as to the Chief Constable Simon Byrne.‘Vexatious prosecutions’Mr Coveney said on social media he and Mr Lewis had had “a very positive first call” and he was “looking forward” to working with him “for as long I hold my role in government”.Ms O’Neill said following her conversation with Mr Lewis they agreed to meet “as a matter of urgency” to discuss “important matters including his government’s approach to the legacy of the conflict, particularly in relation to the bad faith shown over the issue of pensions for those injured as a result of the conflict”.Mr Johnson has pledged to end what he describes as “vexatious prosecutions” against former servicemen.Ms O’Neill also said she intended to challenge Mr Lewis on the financial commitments made by the British government in the New Decade, New Approach deal and on Brexit.Meanwhile, Ms Foster told the BBC that Mr Lewis “has to be an advocate for the union and I very much hope that he is”.Regulatory checksMr Lewis is a former chairman of the Conservative Party and has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.Both he and Mr Johnson have previously said there will be no customs or regulatory checks on the Irish Sea as a result of Brexit.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said during a recent speech in Belfast that there would be regulatory checks at Northern Ireland’s ports and airports for goods arriving from Great Britain.Asked to clarify this, Mr Lewis replied: “We’ve always said the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland is going to be one area and all will be able to benefit from our future global trade deals.“I appreciate what Michel Barnier says, he’s a very good man trying to do a good job for the EU, but this is also the man who said we couldn’t open the withdrawal agreement. And our prime minister got that agreement opened, got a new agreement, got it through parliament and we’ve left the European Union and we’re going to build a future beneficial economy for the whole of the United Kingdom as one,” he said.

It may make us cold, distant and emotionally stunted, but it turns out that, when apocalypse looms, it may help us survive.That, anyway, is the advice of one of our leading virologists, who says our lack of touchy-feeliness will make it easier for us to cut out the hugs, kisses and handshakes that can spread coronavirus.Or, as Prof John Oxford of Queen Mary University of London told the BBC last week: “The coronavirus rather hates it in England compared to China because we are so stand-offish.”Yet is he right to be so confident? I wouldn’t dispute Prof Oxford on the science, but I wonder if he inhabits the same London as I do, where in recent years Continental-style social kissing has spread through the population like... well, like a virus. And unlike corona, there is a glaring absence of official guidance on how to deal with it.Take the French-style double kiss, for example, once confined safely to the boulevards of Paris, but now practised by growing numbers of Londoners. It may make you look sophisticated and, for those who wish it, convey a certain Remainer chic. But for middle-aged provincial types like me – to whom a double kiss is better known as a snooker term – it’s a social minefield.After all, how am I supposed to know whether the woman I’m greeting is a “doubler” or an old-school singles type? Time and again, I’ve opted for the double kiss, only for the recipient to turn their cheek away, leaving me lunging unsuccessfully like some sex-pest uncle. Alternatively, when I’ve played it safe by opting for the single kiss, I’ve offended some doubler the other way round.True, there’s the odd north London luvvie who seems to instinctively know the form. For me, though, it’s a recipe for embarrassment and, occasionally, headbutts. It’s what the French presumably invented the phrase “faux pas” for. And in the MeToo world, where physical contact is already a rather fraught issue, faux pas are something I can do without.With other blokes, a straightforward, manly handshake used to suffice. Not any more, thanks to the introduction of the “manhug”. Now, old acquaintances insist on embracing like they’re Tony Soprano greeting an associate who’s just done 20 years in the slammer. And I mess it up by just sticking my hand out, like some emotional retard who isn’t that pleased to see them. Sorry, guys, I’m not trying to offend. I just didn’t know the rules.So, personally, I’ll welcome any coronavirus-imposed “no contact” rule. Trust me, it won’t be the end of the world. I covered the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2014, where this was strictly observed, and folks seemed no less friendly for it. Come to think of it, I probably came across as far less socially inept than I do in an average weekend socialising in London.Indeed, when I heard Prof Oxford last week urging people to avoid unnecessary physical contact, well, I could have hugged him. But he wouldn’t like that. And nor, frankly, would I.Coronavirus latest news: \u0026#39Why won\u0026#39t you help us?\u0026#39 Britons plead with GovernmentStorm Dennis latest news: \u0026#39Life-threatening\u0026#39 situation as Met Office issues red weather warningNarendra Modi\u0026#39s Hindu nationalism gives rise to vigilante attacks on ChristiansLove Island presenter Caroline Flack took her life three weeks before assault trialComment: Fiscal rules and tough chancellors are rarely popular, but they keep tax rises at baySadiq Khan accused of \u0026#39selling off the family silver\u0026#39 to fund TfLOwners of crime-hit listed homes lambast policeComment: Our overtly political judges are long overdue a moment of reckoning Flights taken by climate-conscious Natural History Museum revealedNasa reaches for the stars with nuclear-propelled spacecraftCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world China seizes the narrative with moving stories of coronavirus survivalCoronavirus: First European death as Chinese tourist dies in FranceBBC will be forced to scrap licence fee and downsize, say Boris Johnson\u0026#39s aidesSecret of what makes us appear 36 years youngerStorm Dennis: Second body pulled from the sea near Kent as bad weather set to continue on SundayCharles Darwin asked for price of Origin of Species to be slashed after receiving letters from working-class who could not afford bookWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus get us infected diamond princess plead britons","story":"British passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, where hundreds have tested positive for coronavirus, have pleaded with the UK Government to to evacuate them after the US, Canada and Hong Kong announced they would move their citizens off the ship.David Abel, who is among the 78 Britons stuck on the ship since February 3, said that he feels completely overlooked, neglected and forgotten and asked the Government: Don’t you want your people home? I’ve never felt less loved by my own country than right now.”In a Facebook post on Sunday he said: Can I tell you, UK, how this makes me really feel? If feels like we have been forgotten, that you don’t really care about us and that you don’t really want us to come home.”Japan confirmed yesterday that the number of people aboard infected with the coronavirus is now 355, up by 70 in the past 24 hours.On Friday, the US embassy in Tokyo sent a message telling their citizens on board that a chartered plane would arrive this evening in Japan, and recommended they disembarked out of an abundance of caution and return home.They are expected to undergo a further quarantine of 14 days upon arrival at a US military base in California. Hong Kong and Canada announced on Saturday that they would also repatriate its citizens.The move has left the Britons on board furious at the prospect of being left on the Diamond Princess to endure their continued quarantine. Speaking via a live link from the ship, Mr Abel, 74, said: All us Brits are going to have to do our own thing. It\u0027s wonderful how the Americans are going to come and take them home ... but nothing is happening for UK passengers.We feel that we\u0027ve been completely overlooked, neglected, forgotten. Our greatest fear is that we\u0027ll be split up.His wife Sally said: Everything\u0027s very quiet with the UK. Nobody\u0027s actually talking to us.The couple from Oxfordshire said they had no official communication from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), beyond two instances from Phil Madden, the UK ambassador to Japan. But he\u0027s not telling us what he\u0027ll do for us, said Mr Abel.Alan Steele, another British passenger on the ship, posted on Facebook that the confinement was a risk to the passengers\u0027 mental health.“I think it is about time boris got the brits back to england as the japanese are being totally incompetent and do not realise you cannot keep ppl in solitary confinement for 28 days without damaging their mental health, Mr Steele posted. What does WHO have to say about this and I am sure cruel punishment like this has to be illegal.”It is understood the Government is examining possible evacuation and repatriation options, including joining flights arranged by other countries, and is contacting British passengers and crew on the ship.An FCO spokesman said: We are urgently speaking to authorities in Japan and the UK. We are working around the clock to ensure the welfare of the British nationals on board.According to Japanese health officials, those onboard who tested positive for the virus were transferred to hospitals.At least three Britons tested positive and were receiving treatment. Coronavirus, which originated in central China, has infected more than 68,500 people globally, the vast bulk of them in China, killing 1,600. The largest number of cases outside China have been on the Diamond Princess. The ship, which has 3,500 passengers and crew, was quarantined upon arrival in Yokohama, 20 miles south of Tokyo, on Feb 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong, before it headed for Japan, was diagnosed with the virus.Meanwhile, 1,500 people on board the MS Westerdam were allowed to disembark in Cambodia after five countries denied it a berth despite health screenings showing no symptoms of the virus. Passengers were welcomed ashore by Hun Sen, the prime minister, who handed them flowers.A World Health Organisation-led joint investigation in China due to start this weekend will focus on the severity of Coronavirus and how it has spread.It emerged that an 80-year-old Chinese man who died from the virus in France - the first death in Europe - had flagged himself up to doctors soon after arriving in France on Jan 16, but they initially failed to recognise his symptoms as the Covid-19 coronavirus.The man had been receiving treatment in the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, in northern Paris. His daughter was also taken to hospital but the French authorities said she was likely to make a good recovery.His death was announced by Agnès Buzyn, the French health minister. She added that there was no cause for concern about the condition of the other six coronavirus patients in French hospitals, including five Britons.All were expected to make a full recovery, according to medical sources.Another four coronavirus patients were discharged from French hospitals with a clean bill of health, Ms Buzyn said.The minister was due to hold a meeting with health professionals on Tuesday to discuss how to stem the spread of the virus. We must prepare our health system to cope with a possible pandemic and the circulation of the virus in our country, she said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secret makes us appear 36 years younger","story":"Some older people are ageing so badly that their body is 48 years older than their actual age, scientists have found.In contrast, other so-called ‘super-agers’ are growing old surprisingly slowly, and may be biologically still in their 20s.Researchers at the University of Southern California looked at the rate of change occurring to the DNA of more than 4,000 over-57s and found striking differences between biological age and chronological age.At the far end of the scale one 66-year-old was found to have a biological age of 114, while another 59-year-old was physically just 23.The team looked at epigenetic changes, which are modifications to DNA that turn genes ‘on’ or ‘off.’With epigenetic changes, the underlying DNA sequence remains unchanged, but cells start to ‘read’ genes differently, almost like switching programmes on washing machine, or dimming a light. The changes alter how the body functions and can trigger disease.Damaging environmental factors such as smoking, stress, pollution or obesity cause the alterations, and the culmination of epigenetic changes can be used like a clock to determine how fast a person is ageing.Dr Eileen Crimmins, Professor of Gerontology, at the University of Southern California, said: “Some people who are 57 or older look like they’re in their twenties, while some people look like they’re over 100, and there’s a big range in between.“We think that adverse social experiences can change your epigenetic profile in ways that may subsequently influence your health adversely.“There were people who looked 36 years younger, while some look 48 years older.“We’re trying to understand ageing health changes and the biological pathways so that we can better understand what we’re really interested in, which is social differentials and ageing.“People believe that the underlying process of ageing is one that underlies all the different health outcomes link to age, such as cognitive decline, disease, disability, frailty and mortality.”Researchers took blood samples from participants and tested them against three ‘epigenetic clocks’ which have been devised by scientists in recent years, to measure DNA changes at different points of the genetic code.Their goal was to find out which social factors were speeding up or slowing the ageing process and so they compared the clock results to participants’ education, life traumas, mental health, race and sex to see if they could tease out which events were contributing to ageing.“We have lots of evidence that these social factors are linked across the board to the major health outcomes associated with age, and we’re attempting to try to understand the biology of how social factors affect ageing outcomes,” added Prof Crimmins.They found that being female slowed down the ageing clock by up to two years, while obesity speeded it up by up to 18 months. Suffering psychological distress also increased biological age by around four months, and poor childhood health was also found to accelerate ageing.However the results threw up some unexplainable findings. The clocks appeared to show that low socioeconomic status in childhood and having a drinking problem delayed ageing.“Across the board the clocks related being female to decelerated ageing which makes sense, given what we know about mortality,” added Prof Crimmins.“Childhood health problems and negative psychological problems both make you look epigenetically somewhat older.“Drinking problems are actually in the wrong direction but we find that obesity increases epigenetic age by about one and a half years. So some of it makes sense, and some of it sort of doesn’t.”The research was presented at the AAAS meeting in Seattle and full findings are due to be published in March.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/14/12/BP-oil-rig.jpg","title":"climate change greenwashing bp net zero 2050 advertising","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.BP’s aim of achieving net zero emissions has rightly been criticised for lacking substance, but its commitment to stop misleading adverts about its impact on the climate is a welcome start – it must be held to account on this, writes Ben ChapmanBuried a couple of thousand words beneath BP’s eye-catching announcement that it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 was an important promise that garnered much less attention.The oil company said it would stop funding “corporate reputation advertising” which, in the context of the oil and gas industry, is more commonly known as greenwash.This means BP will end its multimillion-pound “Possibilities Everywhere” campaign, which touted the company’s questionable green credentials. That’s a fairly rapid u-turn, given that the global campaign was only launched last year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesPerhaps BP has realised the futility of spending large sums highlighting the tiny part of its business that generates renewable energy when the company remains synonymous with fossil fuels.\u0026nbspAdverts on billboards, newspapers and television in the UK, US and Europe as well as on social media and online\u0026nbsppictured\u0026nbspgreen fields and windmills alongside phrases like, “working to make energy cleaner”. The ads missed out the fact that\u0026nbsp96 per cent of BP’s capital expenditure is on oil and gas.Thanks in part to the efforts of groups like environmental lawyers ClientEarth which launched a complaint against over the campaign, the company has been held to account.Two decades – and billions of barrels of oil – since BP had the chutzpah to relaunch itself as “beyond petroleum”, people have seen through the facade.“In future, any corporate advertising will be to push for progressive climate policy communicate our net zero ambition invite ideas or build collaboration,” BP said.This statement, unlike the target to go carbon neutral by 2050, can be scrutinised immediately and it will be. I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too. Earlier this month Ryanair was banned from claiming that it was Europe’s “lowest CO2 emissions airline”. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the statement couldn’t be backed up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BP sets target to achieve net zero by 2050 to tackle climate emergencyThe climate crisis is real, but Boris Johnson still ‘doesn’t get it’Boris Johnson forces out UK president of climate change summitAnyone can make a complaint to the ASA about an issue like an misleading environmental claim, it just requires filling out a few boxes on an online form.If this action does not stop airlines and oil companies producing dodgy ads on climate change, sterner laws must be enforced. ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The\u0026nbspFTSE\u0026nbsp100 has a lot of those\u0026nbspInvestment funds that aim to follow or “track” the performance of a designated stock market index, as opposed to trying to beat it, are inexpensive, easy to understand and hugely popular, especially amongst novice investors.\u0026nbspWith good reason. Most of the time they outperform so called actively managed funds run by stock pickers which too rarely beat the markets they\u0027re benchmarked against after their higher costs are factored in.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut trackers pose a problem for people who are concerned enough about the climate crisis to want to green up their investments.\u0026nbspA tracker investor\u0026nbspis inevitably exposed to most, or all, of the constituents of the index their chosen fund tracks. So they have to take the rough with the smooth. Sometimes the rough is very rough indeed from the perspective of planet earth.Britain’s premier stock market index is, for example, chock full of natural resource companies. They are some of FTSE 100\u0027s biggest and most important constituents.\u0026nbspEthical investment isn’t always ethical – here’s what to considerCan cutting investment force firms to go green?World’s largest fund manager to sell coal investments You have oil giants (BP, Shell), you have mining companies (Anglo American, BHP Group, Rio Tinto).\u0026nbspA person who saves via a FTSE 100 or FTSE All Share tracker is hitching their wagon to the performance of all of these companies. So if, say, BP does well, they do well.\u0026nbspTalk about carrying the mark of Cain.\u0026nbspDoes this mean their only option is to scour the ranks of actively managed funds with ESG (environmental, social and governance) screening? Do they have to leave the cheapest, and best, route into the market for most novice and smaller investors on the shelf?\u0026nbspOne way of solving this apparent dilemma is through choosing a tracker manager prepared to vote in favour of things like climate resolutions when they’re put forward.\u0026nbspRegular readers of this column will recall that I looked at the voting behaviour of big asset managers in the last edition.

This challenge is already testing my limits but I have also found myself on an educational path.Six weeks in,\u0026nbspI have to admit that I do not have a clean shopping slate. I bought socks and thermals — but in my defence, the former were for my husband and the latter for my sister. I am not sure if they were trolling me but both (not being a party to my pledge) in particular asked me to buy these items for them.Okay, I also bought myself a vintage shirt, non-plastic food covers to replace cling film with and cotton face pads to cleanse the face without the need for additional products.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m changing my spending habits to help save the planetApart from the vintage shirt these latter purchases are also part of my new outlook on the things I consume: considering materials used in production the use they have and what happens once they become waste.From trying my best to avoid buying lunch wrapped in plastic to opting for plastic free cosmetics, I am trying to progressively reduce my waste.My phone is 20 months old and previously that would mean I would be ready to buy the new shiny phone with the improved camera. Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

This is also why I am keeping a close eye on the experience of all my fellow pledgers. How can I avoid using plastic further? Can I plan my next holiday by train travel? What local produce can I opt for instead of fruit flown in from thousands of miles away? Can I start growing my own parsley and spring onion (my parents have an annual supply of potatoes from their allotment, maybe I have learnt a thing or two from them)?Modern day consumerism (i.e. capitalism) fuels our desire to have more and more. We are somehow convinced we need all this stuff. The planet is at the desperate point where we need to convince ourselves that we actually do not.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They could be anything from sniffing hints of chemicals on alien worlds to indications that there could be structures or lasers on other planets.Dr Tony Beasley, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) telescope based in Virginia, US, said: Determining whether we are alone in the universe as technologically capable life is among the most compelling questions in science.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Scientists hope that citizen scientists will be able to find interesting things in the data – whether that is unknown natural phenomena, or something even more unexpected, such as alien life.“Since Breakthrough Listen’s initial data release last year, we have doubled what is available to the public,” said Breakthrough Listen’s lead system administrator, Matt Lebofsky. “It is our hope that these data sets will reveal something new and interesting, be it other intelligent life in the universe or an as-yet-undiscovered natural astronomical phenomenon.”Yuri Milner, an entrepreneur and founder of the Breakthrough initiative, said: For the whole of human history, we had a limited amount of data to search for life beyond Earth.So, all we could do was speculate.Now, as we are getting a lot of data, we can do real science and, with making this data available to general public, so can anyone who wants to know the answer to this deep question.The initiatives and strategies in expanding the search for extraterrestrial life were presented at the the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Seattle.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They will be given the option of looking at their normal feed or clicking through to the latest posts, which will show in chronological order.Instagram changed the order of the feed in early 2016, almost exactly four years ago, but many of the app\u0027s users still regularly ask for it to come back.Instagram update tells users who they don’t likeIn the time since, the company has had to fight against claims that it leads to almost all posts being missed, and has made some concessions to users by changing the way the algorithm chooses which posts are chosen to be shown.Despite all of that, the company has repeatedly insisted that the chronological feed will not be returning. The new update appears to be some concession for the demands for posts to appear in time order, without entirely reversing the switch to using an algorithm.Instagram did not immediately respond to a request for comment and further information on the potential feature.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s also entirely ultrared, or highly reflective, which is commonplace in the faraway Twilight Zone of our solar system known as the the Kuiper Belt.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The reddish color is indicative of organic molecules.While frozen methane is present, no water has yet been found on the body, which is an estimated 22 miles (36 kilometers) long tip to tip. At a news conference Thursday in Seattle, New Horizons\u0027 chief scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said its size was roughly that of the city.As for the snowman shape, it\u0027s not nearly as flat on the backside as previously thought. Neither the small nor big sphere is fully round, but far from the flatter pancake shape scientists reported a year ago. The research team likened the somewhat flattened spherical forms to the shape of M\u0026ampMs.No rings or satellites have been found. The light cratering suggests Arrokoth dates back to the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. It likely was created by a slow, gentle merger between two separate objects that possibly were an orbiting pair. The resulting fused body is considered a contact binary.This kind of slow-motion hookup likely arose from collapsing clouds in the solar nebula, as opposed to intense collisions theorized to form these planetesimals, or little orbiting bodies.New Horizons flew past Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, more than three years after the spacecraft visited Pluto. Originally nicknamed Ultima Thule, the object received its official name in November Arrokoth means sky in the language of the Native American Powhatan people.Launched in 2006, the spacecraft is now 316 million miles (509 million kilometers) beyond Arrokoth. The research team is looking for other potential targets to investigate. Powerful ground telescopes still under construction will help survey this part of the sky.Emerging technology will enable scientists to develop a mission that could put a spacecraft in orbit around Pluto, 3 billion miles (5 billion kilometers) away, according to Stern. After a few years, that same spacecraft could be sent even deeper into the Kuiper Belt to check out other dwarf planets and objects, he said.The New Horizons scientists reported their latest findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as in three separate papers in the journal Science.David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the studies, said a flyby mission like New Horizons, where encounters last just a few days, is hardly ideal.For future missions, we need to be able to send spacecraft to the Kuiper Belt and keep them there in orbit around objects, Jewitt wrote in a companion piece in Science. That would allow these intriguing bodies to be studied in stunning geological and geophysical detail, he noted.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS.

Passengers were advised to check their airline’s website for latest updates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBritish Airways and easyJet flights cancelledMilitary personnel to be deployed in West Yorkshire to help manage flood riskStorm Dennis could cause more damage than Storm CiaraBody found in search for man overboard in Kent coastSecond body recovered from sea in Kent unrelated to Storm DennisHello and welcome to the Independent\u0027s live blog on Storm Dennis.Flights will be grounded on Saturday for safety reasons as winds are forecast to reach 70mph along coastlines, while some parts of the country could get up to 4.7 inches of rain.\u0026nbspEasyJet has cancelled over 230 flights in and out of the UK on Saturday.\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for easyJet said: Due to forecasted adverse weather conditions caused by Storm Dennis, easyJet, like other airlines, is currently seeing disruption to its flight programme for Saturday February 15th.\u0026nbspWe are doing everything possible to minimise the impact of the disruption for our customers and to arrange alternative travel. Customers on cancelled flights have been given the option of transferring their flight free of charge or receiving a refund. We will also provide hotel rooms and meals for customers who require them.\u0026nbspBritish Airways has also confirmed cancellations, and a spokesman for the airline said: The majority of our flights are planned to operate as planned, but, like all airines flying to and from the UK today, we are experiencing some disruption due to the stormy weather conditions.\u0026nbspWe are merging a small number of Heathrow short-haul flights to the same destination and using larger aircraft where possible to minimise disruption.Met Office forecasters are most worried about damage caused by heavy rain as Storm Dennis sweeps in.Northwest England is likely to be among the worst affected areas, as grounds saturated with rainwater from Storm Ciara will flood again at a faster rate.A Met Office forecaster told the Independent: Rivers will respond much faster this week than they did last week. Rainfall will have a quicker effect unfortunately.\u0026nbspA traffic camera in Wales has taken a battering due to high winds from Storm Dennis, video footage shows.Traffic Wales, the Welsh Government\u0027s traffic information service, said: We are currently on standby for severe disruption including road closures, delays, ersions, fallen trees, debris and flooding.The Met Office has issued a new\u0026nbsphigh impact weather warning for rain in Wales.It said: Spells of heavy and prolonged rain are expected to affect parts of England and Wales over the weekend with higher likelihood of impacts now expected in some areas.Around 20-40mm of rain will fall widely with 50-80mm likely across parts of northern and southern England., This rain is expected to fall across areas already wet from recent rainfall.In a separate warning covering Swansea and Cardiff, the Met Office said: Prolonged, heavy rain is expected leading to 60-80mm rain widely whilst in a few places 100-120mm is possible.An urgent search has been launched for a man in the sea near Margate Harbour, with a Royal Navy warship dispatched to help in the search.HM Coastguard said lifeboats and the coastguard helicopter are involved in the search after reports of a man overboard.A distress call believed to have originated from B Gas Margrethe, a 99-metre Maltese tanker anchored off the coast of Margate,\u0026nbspwas received by the coastguard at 5.41am Saturday and an extensive search of the area commenced.A coastguard spokesman said: RNLI lifeboats from Ramsgate and Margate have been sent, along with the search and rescue helicopter from Lydd.A police RHIB is also on scene. HM Coastguard broadcast a relay to vessels in the area, and a Royal Navy vessel is assisting.Sixty-gun frigate HMS Winchester is believed to have responded to a relay call and is in the area, according to ship tracking data.Additional reporting by agenciesHuge waves have battered the harbour wall at Porthcawl, Wales, as people gathered to watch the spectacle.Dramatic photos show the waves crashing high above the wall, after the Met Office issued a new high impact warning in Wales.28 ft waves are reportedly expected on the south-west and north-west coasts, bigger than waves whipped up by Storm Ciara last weekend.\u0026nbspPlease wait a moment for the live blog to load.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But consider how it has trashed its once-proud reputation:The use of £.billion a year of public money to crush commercial rivals and relentlessly expand. The tedious, institutional liberal-left bias in news, drama and “comedy”. The overpaid executives churning out “woke” bilge, knowing the billions will always keep rolling in.The betrayal of over-s. The waste.Fundamentally it’s a dinosaur in the Netflix era and irrelevant to many, especially young people raised on YouTube.The Government must be bold. We need a much slimmer BBC to survive and focus on quality TV and radio.But the licence has had its day."},{"url":null,"title":"rishi sunak bright man for the job","story":"But with most people muttering “Who ” after Boris Johnson’s Cabinet reshuffle last night, political insiders knew former hedge fund manager Rishi Sunak was always destined for the top.An ambitious man in a hurry, -year-old Sunak is known for his brains, having graduated with a first from Oxford University and won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship to study an MBA at Stanford University in the US.One of the youngest people to ever fill the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sunak was the first head boy of Indian origin at the elite Winchester College and is thought to be the richest sitting MP, worth a reported £million.Dubbed the “Maharaja of the Dales”, he likes to throw lavish summer parties at his £.million Georgian manor house in the village of Kirby Sigston, North Yorks.But the man in charge of the country’s coffers was not born into quite such massive wealth.Dad Yashvir was a GP and mum Usha ran a pharmacy in Southampton, where Sunak would occasionally work.They put in extra hours to pay the huge fees for him to attend £,-a-year Winchester College, and it is an upbringing that helps define his economic philosophy.Sunak has said: “I grew up watching my parents work hard and serve our local community with dedication.“My dad is an NHS family GP and my mum ran her own small business, the local chemist shop.“Small companies are the leblood of our economy.

There was no doubt from the start that he was destined for high office.”After being elected, Sunak moved to a -acre property with its own lake and boathouse in an idyllic small village near Northallerton.It was there he has held lavish summer parties, with champagne and canapes served by unormed staff.Though he earned several million from his investment fund, much of his huge wealth comes through we Akshata’s family.She is the daughter of self-made Indian tech billionaire N.R.

Billions, for sure.What’s interesting is that the ship did not go down with all hands lost.There were  survivors — and they were able to tell rescuers where the Nuestra Senora had sunk. That information has not been lost.So why are we just sitting back letting Spain and Mexico get on with it Britain needs money for its exciting new railway line and all the hospitals Boris Johnson has promised.Andthere’s a small mountain of it sitting at the bottom of the sea off Mexico’s east coast, why don’t we just sneak over there and help ourselves Certainly, our new six-year-old Chancellor should be considering this . . .  once he’s finished his morning bowl of Frosties and tidied his room.Think about it. We have naval ships in the region waging a hopeless war against South American drug cartels.

That’s designed to map the seabed and would be a very useful tool.Frankly, having it in the Caribbean looking for treasure is a much better use of it than having it wandering around Antarctica studying penguins and looking for more dreary evidence of climate change. We know already.I bet the crew would be happier too.Of course, when we do find the loot, Spain will claim it’s theirs, in the same way they say they own Gibraltar.No worries. We’ll just behave like we do when the Greeks say they want the Elgin Marbles back.And Mexico  It’s true the jewels and the gold were sourced from their neck of the woods.But as every schoolboy knows, it’s “finders, keepers”.Britain has a reputation for fair play and decency, but in a cut-and-thrust world we need to be a bit more devious.Maybe then we could find the loot and tell the world we hadn’t. “Nope.

I realise this is a bit tragic.My favourite bridge in the whole wide world spans the Humber.It’s so graceful and delicate – and when I stand at one end and watch it disappear into the mist on a summer’s morning, I often suffer from a small but embarrassing trouser moment.The only annoying thing about the Humber Bridge is that they went to all the trouble and expense of building it simply to connect the small village of Hessle to the even smaller village of Barton. Two places no one has ever heard of.The fabulous Oresund Bridge was needed because it links Sweden and Denmark.It’s the same story in San Francisco, which has many great bridges that connect the city to the rest of Calornia.That’s the point of a bridge. It links two places that need to be linked.Which brings me on to Boris Johnson’s plan to build a -mile bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.Hmmm. I’m aware the Chinese have built a sea bridge this long, but this is a nation that built a whole new coronavirus hospital in SIX DAYS.We are just not that fast. We can’t even build a new railway line without a -year argument.And the fact is that when we finish our new bridge, midway through the rd Century, we will have linked a place called Larne to a place called Portpatrick.Now, I don’t want to have a downer on the plan.Butwe are going to build a -mile bridge over the sea, wouldn’t it be more usefulit went from Dover to Calais Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian.

Engage your brains, not your bank balance.Have a little DISCRETION. Please do not pimp your royal connections to any passing dodgy billionaire or investment banker who claims to care deeply about your charity work.Frankly, it doesn’t look good so far.The nation cringed when Prince Harry buttonholed Disney boss Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King, aggressively pitching Meghan’s availability for “voiceover” work.A member of the Royal Family begging a Hollywood big-shot for work was not a pretty sight.When they handed in their letter of resignation, Harry and Meghan made lofty announcements about “collaborating” with the Queen, as though Her Majesty, , is some grime DJ who could be brought in to remix their latest single.The brutal truth is that we will not see much of Harry and Meghan in these parts.This week they sacked  loyal UK staff and shut their Buckingham Palace office.But by turning their backs on the royal le, Harry and Meghan have placed themselves in an almost impossible situation.They claim to want to be financially independent of Prince Charles and the British taxpayer.Then they will have to grab the big pay days where they can.They will have to earn phenomenal sums of money to fund the lavish lestyle to which they are accustomed.But there is absolutely nothing in either of their CVs to suggest they can make that kind of dough without flogging their royal connections to the highest bidder.If Harry and Meghan are going to support themselves, they are going to have to get their hands dirty in the working world.Harry’s discussions with Goldman Sachs may be focused on his charity work right now, but investment bankers are not renowned for their boundless human compassion.Big bankers — and mega-rich companies like Netflix and Apple — will look at Harry and Meghan and wonder what they can get out of them.Harry and Meghan are free to demean themselves, as Harry did so spectacularly when he shook his diamond-encrusted begging bowl at the boss of Disney.But please don’t demean this country.Please don’t debase the Royal Family, as Prince Andrew has done.Please, Harry and Meghan — do not embarrass the Queen.Because let’s face it, chaps — without your royal connections, the pair of you really don’t add up to very much at all.After all those wild decades, Keith – who is said to have smoked an estimated , fags in his time – clearly believes in moderation in all things.Especially moderation in moderation.IN a pithy turn of phrase worthy of Oscar Wilde, one commentator mused that Labour’s dishevelled Tracy Brabin looked like she had been “banged over a wheelie bin” in her off-the-shoulder frock in the House of Commons.Showing Tracy how it is done, Kate Beckinsale looked stunning in a very similar off-the-shoulder number at a pre-Oscars party.Kate also looks as though she has never even seen a wheelie bin.But it’s not true.

Its given everyone a bit of a buzz.I havent even spoken to my dad about it yet. I saw it on Facebook and immediately texted it to him. Its his birthday.The new graffiti is remarkably similar to Banksys iconic Balloon Girl mural.The piece shows a young girl with her hand extended toward a red heart-shaped balloon being carried away by the wind.It was first spotted in  in ious spots in London and has become one of Banksys most famous works.Banksy is an elusive graffiti artist whose real identity has never been revealed.His street art has been spotted around the south of England, including London, Brighton and Bristol as well as prominent international locations.He is one of the worlds richest and best known artists worth an estimated £million.But last year, his ex-agent Steven Lazarides released a series of exclusive pictures of the young artist at work.The snaps show the secretive street scribbler working on some of his most famous etchings, but his face still remains a mystery.He has at ious times been rumoured to be Bristol street artist Robin Gunningham and Massive Attack musician Robert Del Naja."},{"url":null,"title":"caroline flack honesty sunshine our life inspired","story":"She was also one of the most honest.Unlike so many of our cosseted household names she was approachable, witty and refreshingly open about her own le and struggles.She spoke with candour about her career and her personal le.She was unafraid to open up about her fears and in that way she inspired fans to be open and honest about the problems we all face in le at dferent times.She was a brilliant host of Love Island — funny and insightful without ever being patronising towards the contestants.Her untimely death is a tragedy, the third associated with the show and its future must now be in doubt.The Crown Prosecution Service needs to take a long look in the mirror and ask why it pursued its course of action given what they knew about her vulnerability.We may never know exactly what drove Caroline over the edge.But we will always remember how, like the weather at the TV villa, she brought so much sunshine into our lives.The Duchess of Cambridge’s candour about the joys and pressures of motherhood is to be applauded.Kate’s moving honesty in a new podcast about her feelings of loneliness and “mum guilt” will chime with women across the country.And the fact our future Queen has expressed her feelings so publicly shows how she is subtly modernising the monarchy as well as gaining in self- confidence.The contrast with Meghan and Harry’s complaints about being in the media spotlight will not be lost on the public.While the Sussexes have quit their Royal duties, Kate has kept working hard for her husband and the “firm”.She had to put up with years of jibes about her family and fashion sense, but the nation has now taken her to its heart.We are lucky – and proud – to have this Duchess of Dignity.BRITAIN’S standards in areas like the environment, the minimum wage and workers’ rights are higher than many EU countries.But Brussels is bizarrely demanding that we LOWER our internationally admired regulationswe want to sign up to its tarf-free trade deal.Boris must stick to his mantra of levelling up, not levelling down, and resist the Eurocrats’ race to the bottom.Anything  would betray voters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was frightened that he would get in and kill me.“I’d lie down and turn the lights out — I prayed he would leave me alonehe thought I wasn’t there.”Joanne and McPhillips were together for  years before she kicked him out of their home in the town.She said he had become “distant” and “secretive” and would regularly fly off the handle for any reason.McPhillips moved in with a friend but soon began harassing her with vile texts and voicemails — sending hundreds of threats daily.In one sickening message, the cruel bully pretended to be her stillborn daughter.Joanne said of the texts: “They would start first thing in the morning and go on until last thing at night. He would say he was my wee girl and that I let her die — that I deserved the fact she is gone.“He threatened to cut my throat and blow up my car. He’d throw things at the windows and look through the letterbox. I was terried he would take my kids.”She added: “My own home was like a prison. The lights and TV were never on.

thousands turn to advance payments - but they have to be paid back out of your own benefits. These figures show advance repayments cost £m in one month alone - with struggling northern English towns the worst hitShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  FEB News \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailNearly £million of  Universal Credit benefit payments were clawed back from the poorest households in one month last year, according to the Tory government’s own figures. New claimants for Universal Credit have to wait a minimum of five weeks for their first payment to be processed, forcing many to take out loans form from the Government. The borrowing, known as Advance Payments, to cover their basic living costs before their first entitlement arrives and is then deducted from regular payments. The delay has faced harsh criticism with MPs warning that the need to borrow forces claimants into a cycle of debt with some ending up at food banks as a result.The Department for Work and Pensionsadmitted that in August , the latest period available, it deducted £ million from claimants across the UK to pay back their loans. The ten worst hit areas are in northern towns in what has been referred to as the Red Wall - traditional Labour seats in the North and Midlands many of which fell to the Tories for the first time in the December election.Knowsley was the worst hit with £, repaid for UC Advance Repayment deductions during August closely followed by Hartlepool on £, and Bootle with £,.In Glasgow South West, the constituency of Chris Stephens MP who asked for the figures, £, was repaid for UC Advance Repayment deductions in one month. Stephens described the figures showing the money being clawed back from some of the most deprived areas of the country as “astonishing” It is clear from this answer that the DWP Advance Payment system simply doesn’t work and demonstrates that the UK Social Security system is broken.” Stephens said: “I would urge all Parliamentary colleagues to look at these figures and to press the UK Government to build a social security system fit for purpose, starting with ending the five week wait.”  “What is required is to end the five week wait, and introduce a first payment within the first two weeks of a claim without the need to pay this back – the current system is a vicious circle of debt.”  A DWP spokesperson said: “In August  alone £.bn in Universal Credit was paid out across the UK, and advance repayments amounted to less than  percent of that figure.” In full: The  UK areas worst-hit by Universal Credit advances KEY: Constituency and how much was repaid in Universal Credit advances in August  alone. Other deductions were taken for other reasons - such as overpayments, arrears, fines or fraud - but advance payment deductions made up £.million of the £.million in total deductions across the country. .

She knows getting this wrong at the ­beginning makes for unhappy endings in teenage years and adulthood. She knows that one of the main causes of death in young mums is suicide, which is why she is building a support network to help them. Kate also knows that no matter where you come from, children and parents need support. But background determines whether that support will be forthcoming. Which is why the Tory attack on Sure Start centres is all the more shocking. Today we reveal how austerity cuts mean , have shut since  – that’s more than one in three. Yet Sure Starts do everything that Kate is talking about and more. They not only provide clinics, health advice and support for parents but can identy abuse and neglect early. Now , fewer children have such protection, and that is a national scandal. Better to prevent a child being abused in the first place than wring our hands in horror after the event. Better to spot a young mother’s depression and treat it than to weep at her graveside. Better that Sure Starts catch ­problems early than for them to fester and cost the NHS an extra £million a year. Sure Starts have proved their worth since being introduced in . Now it’s time for Boris Johnson to recognise their value too. Healthy attitude If there is one thing the three Labour leadership contenders can agree on, it is that the NHS needs to be protected from Tory threats to its existence.  Sir Keir Starmer tells the Sunday Mirror today of his own painful experiences sitting by the bedside of his mother and more recently his mother-in-law.Although he sadly lost them both, he has nothing but praise for the NHS care thatthey received.And it has made him all the more determined to ensure the health service gets the resources it needs. It was the post-war Labour government which introduced the NHS. It was successive Labour governments which looked after it.

six-hour operation to remove a tumour which had grown around Leahs spineShareCommentsByJess FlahertyGrace Witherden:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsDad Stephen with daughter Leah \" to FREE daily email

Seven-year-old Leah had le-changing surgery to remove the tumour which had grown around her spine and key blood vessels in August last year.Parents Stephen and Claire Bennett, from St Helens, Liverpool,  were told by other hospitals the operation would be too risky to perform but eventually their daughter was saved by staff at Alder Hey and Royal Liverpool hospitals, reports the Liverpool Echo.Before the six-hour operation a D model was made of the tumour which Stephen held. He said: Staring at it in front of my eyes was just horrying - it looked huge and holding it made the hairs on my neck stand up. He added: I held in my hands the very thing that was killing my little girl and that is quite a chilling experience. I had a strange mix of both extremely positive and extremely negative emotions going through me. Claire was unable to hold the model as she found it too dficult. Leah was diagnosed with the tumour last year after suffering from back ache on and off. When the couple were first shown the MRI scan, Stephen said it was completely horrying.  Stephen, , said: You start to think, how the hell is she going to beat this  How could this have possibly grown inside her without us knowing  It was completely horrying. I felt so empty and helpless and like I had let her down and failed as a parent. The parents were told that surgeons from Great Ormond Street, Bristol and Manchester had all given the opinion that surgery was not even possible for Leah, but Claire begged a consultant to speak to the surgical team to seethe was anything they could do to remove the tumour. After the team began to operate, Leah was only given a  per cent chance of surgeons being able to remove the tumour without it causing major harm like paralysis due to the damage it could cause to her spinal cord, or death.The surgery was carried out by Joanne Minford, Matthew Jones, Fiona Murphy and Professor John Brennan - a vascular specialist from Royal Liverpool Hospital. After the couple were told the operation was successful they broke down into floods of tears. After the success of the six-hour operation, Leah was discharged and home in time for her seventh birthday. She has also been fundraising for the hospital with her sister Phoebe.

William Smith was working as guard in the city centre when he recognised killer Michael Foran and alerted police. Foran strangled his girlfriend June Jones and then repeatedly stabbed her in a brutal attack at her West Bromwich flat in December . After going on the run, Foran was eventually tracked down and sentenced to le in prison in October .Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Will said: I told [West Midlands Police] what Iaposd seen. They asked me to send the pictures, I sent them to them.They said theyaposd get to Liverpool for the Saturday morning. They came, introduced themselves and within half an hour this male was detained. June Katie Jones, , was found with  kne wounds around her neck and the left side of her chest and is believed to have lain dead in the bath of the flat she shared with Foran for three weeks before she was found. Her body was only discovered when police forced their way in to the property on New Yearaposs Eve, .  William identied him following a public appeal and alerted West Midlands Police to his whereabouts. Dad-of-six Will shared a chain of emails between himself and West Midlands Police in which an officer thanked him for helping them capture the wanted man.  In one message a detective working for the force told the -year-old security guard: Thanks Will, all down to you! Will said he wanted to make sure Foran was caught: Iaposm a father. I have a daughter, I have granddaughters. He claims he attempted to report the sighting of Foran to Merseyside Police before contacting the West Midlands force. However, a spokeswoman for the force said Merseyside Police were unable to locate any log of this call to operators.  Will received an award from Interr, the security company he is employed by at River Island, for his efforts in helping capture a wanted murderer. Foran, , from West Bromwich, was captured on CCTV leaving his flat with friend Keith OaposDwyer before  escaping to Liverpool in his accompliceaposs car. On January , Foran was spotted on a camera at an Esso petrol station in  Anfield and police said they believed he had  fled to the city in the hope of travelling to Ireland and evading justice. Just four days later, detectives confirmed that Foran was found  begging on the streets of Liverpool city centre, almost four weeks after police believed June was murdered on December .  He was arrested and transported back to the West Midlands where he was charged with Juneaposs murder. A Birmingham Crown Court In October , Foran was sentenced to le in prison to serve a minimum of  years before being eligible to apply for parole. Keith O’Dwyer, , from West Bromwich, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. He was sentenced to  months in prison. The family of June, also known as Katie, released the following statement moments after he was sentenced.

Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  n  n   nSimon  nSimon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold.  nThe lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP.  nThe speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”.  nI heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour.  nSimon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it.  nBeside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.”  nSimon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help.  nThe nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic.  nI saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.”  n“Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.”  nI broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.”  nThere are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces.  n“Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ”  n“I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ”  n“One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ”  nI saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved.  n“Go on,” he said cautiously.  n“OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ”  nA rueful roll of the eyes.  n“No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.”  n“Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.”  n“I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie.  n“Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.”  nSophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.”  n“I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time.  n“You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness.  n“It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.”  nSimon and Sophie were quietly crying.  n“How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly.  n“I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.”  nSimon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled.  n“OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.”  nWhen people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form.  n  nTop news stories from n   n nAdele  nAdele has spent the last three months of her le in an urban specialist cancer centre.  nIn all that time, she has not felt fresh air.

When patients are admitted, many are fearful of death. But Rachel and her colleagues are determined to help them live le to the full before they die. In a second moving extract from her book Dear Le: A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss, she remembers some of the patients and their stories which will stay with her forever... Dorothy Dorothy was admitted to the hospice on a Monday. “There is no point in spending time with me,” she declared on arrival. “I will be dead on Thursday.” “What makes you think that ” I asked, intrigued. She gave me the kind of lingering stare a teacher reserves for the classroom dunce, then explained: “Mr Edwards. The senior consultant on the surgical ward told me my bowels had stopped working and I would be dead in six days. That was on Friday. I have three days left.” I knew the rudiments of Dorothy’s story. Admitted to AE with acute bowel ­obstruction. Given her age –  – an almost certainly terminal diagnosis. But at no stage was there mention of Thursday. “I will concede I do not feel full of death,” Dorothy stated. “I feel full of le. Butyou don’t mind, I would rather be left alone. I have little time left and I would like to read my newspaper.” Rarely in my career had I been dismissed more magnicently. I hardly dared respond. “Based on my medical assessment, I am not at all certain you’ll be dead on Thursday,” I told Dorothy. “If you had more time, is there any way you would like to spend it ”  “Were I not to be dead on Thursday, then I would certainly be playing bridge with my local group, as I have done every Thursday for the last two decades. But I can assure you I will be dying instead.” “How about this,” I proposed. “We plan for bridge, unless death intervenes ” “Young lady, I will humour youit makes you feel useful.” A good day, for me, in the hospice, is one in which I feel we have helped someone die with comfort and dignity intact. But infinitely preferable are the days when we have helped a dying patient live – be that basking in a bath filled with insanely priced bubblebath, stroking the family Labrador, saying a rushed but no less momentous “I do” from a wheelchair decked in flowers in the hospice chapel, or watching gold finches gleam in the trees outside. In a ward where every patient has a terminal diagnosis, le, in all its loveliness, goes on. On Thursday morning, the nurses busied themselves with washing, sprucing, plumping and preening. When Dorothy finally emerged, dressed for her bridge trip, she could have been Boudica. Desperately thin, her chariot a wheelchair, a pre-emptive dose of morphine in her veins, yet nonetheless sitting ramrod straight with crocodile handbag perched on her lap and an impeccably coordinated green tweed skirt, cashmere cardigan and court shoes. Flushed with all the fuss and attention, Dorothy was, for that Thursday only, the queen of our ward – and she knew it. For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly.The next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simplywasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented.I raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ” A mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.” A few days later, Dorothy died. Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  Simon Simon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold. The lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP. The speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”. I heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour. Simon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it. Beside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.” Simon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help. The nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic. I saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.” “Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.” I broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.” There are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces. “Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ” “I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ” “One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ” I saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved. “Go on,” he said cautiously. “OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ” A rueful roll of the eyes. “No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.” “Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.” “I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie. “Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.” Sophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.” “I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time. “You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness. “It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.” Simon and Sophie were quietly crying. “How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly. “I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.” Simon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled. “OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.” When people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form.

Her paedo partner Paul Saunders hates the way she idolises Dales bad boy Cain Dingle, played by -year-old Jeff. She has the actor’s face as a screensaver on her phone, with the Emmerdale theme tune as her ringtone. Matthews, , kidnapped her own daughter Shannon in a bid to grab a £, reward. She was jailed in  and freed after three years. Saunders, , a handyman, was jailed for five years in  for sexually abusing a child. Now he is said to be upset that Matthews called Cain her “dream man”. A source said: “Karen is a massive Emmerdale fan. If it’s on, no one is allowed to speak. “Her and Paul are ­constantly ­bickering about her obsession with Cain. He ­hates it because he’s a long away from looking like Cain Dingle.” Matthews, , from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, has ­horried pals by moving Saunders into her one-bedroom flat in the south of England, where the taxpayer picks up her £-a-month rent. Her pal added: “People are turning their backs on her because of Saunders. He abused a child and that’s not something people can overlook.”  Matthews has told friends that she loves Saunders, that he is a “changed man” and they plan to marry this year. Our source said: “She says she won’t get anyone  and that Saunders looks after her. But how can she have him near her  It’s disgusting. No one will want to witness them two getting hitched.” Matthews speaks to old pals in Dewsbury regularly on the phone and on social media but she is legally banned from the town, where she let police and locals search for nine-year-old Shannon for  days.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA man who obsessively loves to clean and who left school at  now earns up to £, a week valeting cars. Liam Maguire, , counts famous footballers and high-flying Dubai business men amongst his clients after launching his own business three years ago. Now, he earns big money cleaning, polishing and waxing cars, charge anywhere from £ to £, per job. But as Liam, from Rainhill, Merseyside, explains, itaposs more than just washing a few windows.Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, he said: It falls down to who has the greatest level of OCD but doing it safely to ensure no excess contact or damage is caused to the car, while at the same time using high grade products to ensure the best finish.Everyday car washes can cause scratches and damage. I’m the guy you call to fix what they’ve caused and also promise you serious satisfaction. But it hasnapost always been fast supercars and rich businessmen for Liam, who has had to work his way up the ladder. He said: I started Urban Valets off the back of my old job. I worked for a company in St Helens since leaving school. I started at  as the aposrag handapos and I eventually became the valeting bay manager at , in charge of people twice my age with double the years in experience. I was unfortunately made redundant.My boss kindly helped me with a van and then became Urban Valets.I still to this day have a great relationship with my old boss and I also maintain his cars.” But the gamble paid off and Liam is now doubling his turnover year-on-year whilst working with some of the most luxurious cars in the business. Liam said: My services range from £ up to thousands. My highest paid job was £, and it took me a week solid. That was on a McLaren S in Manchester for a client who deals in Bitcoin and banking.As for my high profile clients, I never aimed for such football players as my business aim is to impress people who know about cars. I mean that in a respect in which to prove I’m the best at my job. Liamaposs first high profile client was the Red Bull drt masters racers, which then caught the attention of serious-level insurance brokers, multi-business owners who own supercars such as McLarens, Lamborghinis and Ferraris. He said: My greatest achievement is working on the rarest and most expensive supercar that’s in the UK currently, a McLaren Senna. The price tag with upgrades costs around £.million. I’m the only detailer to ever touch one of these rare vehicles. The owner is from Dubai and personally requested me and another valeter to meet at the Birmingham NEC autosport car show and work on this vehicle. I also recently completed a week-long detail down in Essex on a rare show spec  BMW E i which has to be perfect as it is attending a show in Austria in May. I was down in Essex all expenses paid for a week for this, which means a lot to little old me from Merseyside.” Liam admits working with these high-level clients is aposnerve-rackingapos but says that he aposthrivesapos upon the moment and sees it as his apostime to shineapos. Liam said: I know I’m good, I believe in myself and every multi-millionaire I’ve ever met has been that impressed theyaposve sat and gave me advice and wisdom. Something money can’t buy I suppose, so that’s what I enjoy most about my job.With his reputation growing, almost as a by-product Liamaposs Instagram also rocketed.Nearly  people follow Urban Valet on Instagram, which Liam says is due to his bright personality. He said: My following grew massively on Instagram due to my attitude, I shined light on a boring industry and made it fun.  I simplied everything so people could be involved...I shared tips and hints on my Instagram posts and also allowed people to see me and my personality. So much so, that Liam even has people recognising him in the streets. He continued: I get people stopping me when shopping and eating out. Hey it’s urban valets”.

Parents Bryn and Leigh Davies and their four children were living in a bungalow at a school where he once worked as a resident caretaker. But they claim they were thrown out by Hertfordshire County Council and given just an hour to pack a few essentials to take to a hotel where they were crammed into two rooms. Through tears, Mrs Davies, , said they are distressed and worried about their future, adding: We have nothing. We were a happy family and we’ve been robbed. We just want to go home and be a family unit again. Are you a struggling parent  Email your story to webnews@mirror. We are being treated like criminals. I’m scared I am going to lose my children. I can’t sit back and do nothing. I have four children. I have to fight for them. The Davies and their two sons - Rhys, , and George,  - are now staying in two small rooms in a converted office block  minutes from home. Their daughters - Grace, , and Emily,  - are staying where. Stay-at-home mum Mrs Davies toldthat the family moved into the three-bedroom bungalow at the now-defunct Sheredes Senior School in Hoddesdon, Herts, in January  when her husband was hired.  She said they paid £. a month in subsidised rent, were responsible for bills and maintenance, and carried out modications to accommodate Mr Daviesapos disability from severe back pain. But in July  Mr Davies, , was sacked by the school - unfairly, he claims - and the family were ordered to move out, with the council saying his right to remain in the property automatically ceased in accordance with his Service Occupancy Agreement. The family refused to leave and this led to a y legal battle that made its way to the High Court in October  and Supreme Court in . At the High Court, the Davies argued that they should be allowed to stay in the home and the council had failed to consider the welfare of their children, who were raised in the bungalow.  But the court sided with the council, saying the familyaposs right to occupy the home ended with his job and they had been trespassing ever since he was dismissed. It allowed the council to move ahead with the eviction, but remained in the bungalow, located next to the school gates, and continued to pay rent. The Davies claim they werenapost notied when the council applied for permission to enforce the writ of possession and the case went to court without their knowledge last year, meaning they werenapost giving an opportunity to mount a challenge. Mrs Davies claims the family had no idea they were being evicted until enforcement officers knocked on her door on February .  The council said since the summer of  it had asked the family a number of times to leave voluntarily, but Mr Davies refused. It said it held off from evicting the family for two years while Mr Davies appealed, and the appeals ended last summer. The eviction was authorised by the court, but the Davies claim it was unlawful because they werenapost give notice. They have launched a new challenge, arguing they were deprived of their legal right to seek a stay, and a hearing is due to take place on March . Mrs Davies, whose family have launched an online petition to publicise their case, said tearfully: There was a knock at the door and there were seven enforcement officers there to evict us.  They saidwe did not go we would be arrested and face  weeks in prison. At the end of the day, there were  enforcement officers. We were told just to take emergencies like medication and paperwork and clothes. It was absolute hell, we were in pieces. It was intimidating. At that point, we had to just go.  She added: We were illegally evicted. We were never served a notice. The whole family has been split up. We’ve been told that the bungalow is to be sold. It’s all for profit, it is greed. The council said it has not yet made a formal decision on the future of the property. Mr Davies now works as a pest control supervisor in London. His we said he has suffered from depression and anxiety, and attempted to take his own le following a mental breakdown that occurred while he was working at the school.  He claims it was brought on by bullying and harassment in the workplace. Mrs Davies said he was sacked when he was on sick leave. Sheredes School closed in  - a year after Mr Davies was dismissed - and a new academy has since opened in its place. The council doesnapost run the school, but it still owns the bungalow at the site. After being forced out of the home, the family were put in two rooms in a hotel in Great Dumlow, Essex, and then moved into a former office block in Harlow. Mrs Davies said: The most distressing thing is Iaposm not with all of my children. Thereaposs no room for all of us.  We have two studio rooms with two single beds in each but they are not next door to each other. In my room there thereaposs a wardrobe with no hanging rail, a microwave, a washing machine and dryer, a fridge, a two-wing hob and a tiny bathroom. We have nothing to do. We have no TV. My children have no toys. All of our possessions are still in the bungalow and the locks have been changed. It was my husband’s th birthday last week, his presents are still in the home. Friends are taking care of their dog, two cats and budgee. Mrs Davies said the situation has brought anxiety and stress upon the family, adding: My sons are embarrassed. My -year-old said people are laughing because they know he was sleeping on the floor on a mattress at the hotel.

she needed to repay £, in child benefit to the government because of commission her partner had earnedShareCommentsByZoe Chamberlain:,  FEB News\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum was stunned when she learned she and her partner had to pay back £, of child benefit because of a little-known rule. Lorraine Dyer, from Halesowen, West Mids, has child benefit paid directly into her bank account. But she and partner Gareth were shocked when they were told by HMRC they owed thousands back to the government due to commission he had received from his job as a recruitment consultant. A rule is in place whereby iniduals who earn more than £, have to pay back a certain amount of their child benefit in income tax. And earnings that tip them over the threshold can come from money earned as commission, overtime, bonuses or even a company car allowance.  Gareth works as a recruitment consultant and didn’t realise that his commission had tipped him over the edge, Lorraine, who runs Mini First Aid classes, told Birmingham Live.“It’s the fact it came out of the blue that was so annoying,we had known we would have cancelled immediately! she said. We always follow all the rules and don’t try to cheat at anything. It seems HMRC are getting a nice tidy sum from something that they could have easily adjusted. Many of our friends experienced this too, so it seems weaposre not a minority! We received no notication, we were just told we had a £, debt. Then when we questioned it, they added on an additional fine for delayed payment. She added: The tax office said he was supposed to have sent self assessment tax s but he didn’t think he had to do this because he’s not self employed. He’s never had to do that before. “It gets set up automatically and then you just forget about it. It worked out to be around three years worth that we owed. It had been coming in for such a long time, around £ a month that we didn’t really notice it going in.  They said we could pay it back in installments over a year but that’s quite a short timeframe. It’s money we could have spent on a holiday. The rule, which was brought in back in  but is not very well known, currently means families have to pay back one per cent for every £ they earn over the threshold. And Lorraine is not the first parent to be caught unawares by this rule.Richard and Rebekha Nicholls, from Grimsby, were told to pay back a hefty £, after encountering the same problem.In that case, Richardaposs company car was what tipped them over the limit.

Just four weeks ago the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were ­sticking to the official line about ­“iding their time between the UK and Canada”. They told us they were forging a future as ­“progressive” royals – serving the Queen on the one hand while p­ursuing their ­humanitarian ­mission. And, as they settled into a wealthy pal’s ­£million Vancouver ­mansion, their  dedicated Buckingham Palace staff were ­desperately trying to make sure the Sussexes have their cake and eat it. But Harry and Meghan had ­already lost their appetite for Victoria sponge at teatime.] They could smell all those free maple cookies and American pie. And just look at how they’ve ­started feeding off fatcat bankers at a summit in Miami hosted by JP Morgan. So now we know what “le out of the spotlight” means for the struggling Sussexes. Turning up at ­billionaires’ ­bashes to bang on about mental health, Princess Diana’s death and saving the planet – for a hefty fee. Meanwhile back in Blighty,  members of staff are negotiating ­redundancy ­pay-offs.  Because Harry and Meghan have stopped pretending they want to be part-time royals and are ­closing down their Buckingham Palace office. But before they go, some of those axed aides will still have to organise the farewell ­engagements lined up for the Sussexes. They include the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey on March , which the Queen ­asked them to attend. The monarch, who was so hurt by Megxit, wants to see Harry standing beside his ­brother William at the very heart of her family, before he finally quits the Firm.

Two bodies were pulled from rough seas on Saturday before the worst of the storm hit.One man was found following a huge search operation off Margate after an early-morning distress call, while another was found at Herne Bay. Leboats and the coastguard helicopter had been scouring the sea near Margate Harbour after reports of a man overboard, HM Coastguard said. In the other incident, Kent Police were called at .pm on Saturday to a report a person had been pulled from the sea in Herne Bay. The US National Weather Serviceaposs Ocean Prediction Centre reported winds up to mph and waves that could reach more than fthigh across the North Atlantic. Forecasters were expecting winds to reach mph along coastlines, while some parts of the country could witness up to .inof rain. Experts have warned that conditions amount to a perfect storm, with hundreds of homes at risk of flooding.The Met Office has issued eight weather warnings covering most of the UK this weekend.This includes amber warnings from midday on Saturday over southern Scotland, northern England, Wales and part of the South West saying that flooding could cause a danger to le.Thousands of travellers have had their flights grounded for safety reasons, with British Airways and easyJet confirming cancellations. More than  easyJet flights in and out of the UK on Saturday have been cancelled, while sports fans discovered several fixtures were also called off due to the weather. Residents in West Yorkshire, which was badly hit by flooding during last weekendaposs Storm Ciara, are being helped by British Army personnel sent out by the Ministry of Defence . A spokesman for British Airways said they are merging a small number of Heathrow short-haul flights to the same destination and using larger aircraft where possible to minimise disruption, while a spokeswoman for easyJet confirmed  cancellations. Ryanair said all its flights are operating as normal.A spokeswoman for Heathrow Airport said: To minimise the number of flights cancelled at short notice we have taken the joint decision, alongside our airline and air traffic partners, to pre-emptively consolidate todayaposs schedule. A spokesman for Luton Airport said the airport is fully operational, but added that a number of cancellations are expected later on Saturday. The MoD said  personnel from th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, will be aiding the Environment Agencyin constructing barriers and repairing flood defences in Ilkley and Calderdale, while  Reservists from th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, have also been tasked with providing support where required. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it. The rapid response of the Army today will help with provision of flood relief to local communities in West Yorkshire. The EA said flooding is likely to be worse than under last weekendaposs Storm Ciara due to rain falling on already saturated ground. In England alone,  properties were left flooded when Storm Ciara struck, the EA said. North Wales Police said very high winds had led to debris and branches falling off trees and Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said it had rescued a motorist from a car stuck in flood water in the Liskeard area. Power cuts are also expected and there is a good chance that train and buses will see cancellations or delays and roads closed. The Met Office said the main areas of concern on Saturday are north and south-west England and Wales, with the South East bearing the brunt more on Sunday. At just after pm on Saturday, there were  flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected - and more than  flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - in places across the country. Flood defences are due to be in operation this weekend, with additional temporary flood barriers being installed in Shropshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Surrey. More than  staff are on active incident duty and  mobile pumps have been deployed, the EA said.

But after climbing to the top with the ring in his pocket, his nerves got the better of him.  nNext he took Sophie to a posh London restaurant to do the deed and backed out again – because he thought the scene was too busy.  nEventually he asked Sophie one morning in bed and they began ­planning a beach wedding in Cuba for  guests for October  last year.  nBut six weeks before the big day, Matt’s mum Elaine, , had a bad fall while doing DIY in her kitchen and developed an infection. She could hardly walk and medics told her she might not be able to fly.  n  n   nThomas Cook travel money card customers told to withdraw money now or lose it   nEx-Thomas Cook flight attendant aposmurdered by stalker who broke into flatapos   nDays later Sophie’s sister Kirsty, , was diagnosed with mouth cancer. Her emergency operation was booked for the week of the wedding.  nSophie and Matt, from Minehead, Somerset, decided to go ahead ­without her despite Kirsty being the chief bridesmaid.  nSophie said: “We were all ­devastated. Kirsty’s health was more important than the wedding but ­everything was already booked so we felt we had to go ahead.  n“Kirsty’s children Bertie, who is four, and seven-year-old Beatrice were meant to be my page boy and flower girl, along with their cousins, but they wouldn’t make it either.  n“I didn’t want my mum Paula to have to choose between Kirsty and me so I told her to stay in England to look after my sister, which meant my dad most likely wouldn’t come out to see me get married either.”  nJust when they thought things couldn’t get any worse, there was a blow four weeks before the ­ceremony when Thomas Cook went bust.  nThe couple had booked a £, wedding package with the firm at the Iberostar hotel in Playa Pilar in Cuba.  n  n   nThomas Cook passenger who drunkenly urinated and vomited in plane seat jailed   nSophie said: “Thomas Cook staff were convinced there was going to be a buyout. They sent us an email the night before the collapse saying ­everything would be OK.  n“But then we never heard from anyone again. The staff that we had been dealing with had lost their jobs.  n“I was already doubting whether we should board the plane because I was worried about my sister, and Matt’s mum was hobbling about with her foot.  n“In some ways it was a bit of a relief when Thomas Cook folded and we were told the whole thing was ­cancelled but, after everything that happened, we felt numb.”  nThe couple ended up booking a last-minute consolation holiday to Mexico and spent the day they were meant to marry on the beach. Last month they ­finally got back the £, they had paid for their ceremony, hotel and tickets.  nTheir guests, who had booked through Thomas Cook as well, also got their money back because the trip was covered by the Atol financial protection scheme.  n  nUKaposs best destinations for stag dos and hen dos including accommodation costs   n   n   nSophie’s sister Kirsty’s operation was a success and she is now almost fully recovered.  nBut the £, the couple spent on gts for their guests was wasted ­because they were etched with last October’s wedding date.  nSophie, a personal assistant, said: “We knew Cuba was a long way for our  guests to travel so bought ­everyone jewellery and watches to say thank you. Unfortunately it’s all now sitting upstairs useless.  n“All the napkins and table ­decorations and stationery had the date on too. So that’s also money wasted. It’s been a nightmare.”  nThe couple, who first got together in  while both working in HR at Debenhams, say planning a new date has left them feeling flat.  nSophie said: “It’s hard to get motivated to rearrange everything again.  n  n   n“We’ve started to throw some ideas around but nobody seems excited about it because they’ve been through all the disappointment with us. We are just disheartened.  n“My dress is a beautul summer one with little straps so I’d be keen to get married in sunshine.  n“But I don’t think we will go abroad after our last experience.

Sophie, , is a contender for Britain’s unluckiest bride after a ­series of traumas which ended with her big day cancelled. But she might have had an inkling things would not go smoothly after fiancé Matt Stevens chickened out from his proposal – twice. Matt, , first planned to pop the question at the top of a volcano in Bali at sunrise. But after climbing to the top with the ring in his pocket, his nerves got the better of him. Next he took Sophie to a posh London restaurant to do the deed and backed out again – because he thought the scene was too busy. Eventually he asked Sophie one morning in bed and they began ­planning a beach wedding in Cuba for  guests for October  last year. But six weeks before the big day, Matt’s mum Elaine, , had a bad fall while doing DIY in her kitchen and developed an infection. She could hardly walk and medics told her she might not be able to fly. Days later Sophie’s sister Kirsty, , was diagnosed with mouth cancer. Her emergency operation was booked for the week of the wedding. Sophie and Matt, from Minehead, Somerset, decided to go ahead ­without her despite Kirsty being the chief bridesmaid. Sophie said: “We were all ­devastated. Kirsty’s health was more important than the wedding but ­everything was already booked so we felt we had to go ahead. “Kirsty’s children Bertie, who is four, and seven-year-old Beatrice were meant to be my page boy and flower girl, along with their cousins, but they wouldn’t make it either. “I didn’t want my mum Paula to have to choose between Kirsty and me so I told her to stay in England to look after my sister, which meant my dad most likely wouldn’t come out to see me get married either.” Just when they thought things couldn’t get any worse, there was a blow four weeks before the ­ceremony when Thomas Cook went bust. The couple had booked a £, wedding package with the firm at the Iberostar hotel in Playa Pilar in Cuba.  Sophie said: “Thomas Cook staff were convinced there was going to be a buyout. They sent us an email the night before the collapse saying ­everything would be OK. “But then we never heard from anyone again. The staff that we had been dealing with had lost their jobs. “I was already doubting whether we should board the plane because I was worried about my sister, and Matt’s mum was hobbling about with her foot. “In some ways it was a bit of a relief when Thomas Cook folded and we were told the whole thing was ­cancelled but, after everything that happened, we felt numb.” The couple ended up booking a last-minute consolation holiday to Mexico and spent the day they were meant to marry on the beach. Last month they ­finally got back the £, they had paid for their ceremony, hotel and tickets. Their guests, who had booked through Thomas Cook as well, also got their money back because the trip was covered by the Atol financial protection scheme.  Sophie’s sister Kirsty’s operation was a success and she is now almost fully recovered. But the £, the couple spent on gts for their guests was wasted ­because they were etched with last October’s wedding date. Sophie, a personal assistant, said: “We knew Cuba was a long way for our  guests to travel so bought ­everyone jewellery and watches to say thank you. Unfortunately it’s all now sitting upstairs useless. “All the napkins and table ­decorations and stationery had the date on too. So that’s also money wasted. It’s been a nightmare.” The couple, who first got together in  while both working in HR at Debenhams, say planning a new date has left them feeling flat. Sophie said: “It’s hard to get motivated to rearrange everything again.  “We’ve started to throw some ideas around but nobody seems excited about it because they’ve been through all the disappointment with us. We are just disheartened. “My dress is a beautul summer one with little straps so I’d be keen to get married in sunshine. “But I don’t think we will go abroad after our last experience.

The Environment Agency has issued  flood warnings and  more alerts as spells of heavy and prolonged rain are expected to hit northern and parts of southern England. The agency recorded highest levels on the River Ouse in flood-hit York and expected the river to peak on Monday evening. The unsettled weather conditions are set to bring up to mm of rainfall on Sunday, with hundreds of homes at risk of flooding. The Met Office has now issued a rare red rain warning for south Wales, with extensive flooding likely and communities facing being cut off. People residing near the Scottish Borders have been warned to expect aposextensive flooding to properties and businesses, with many roads impassableapos. The Met Office has issued eight weather warnings - three yellow wind warnings and five amber rain warnings - covering most of the UK today. It comes after Storm Dennisapos winds peaked at mph on Saturday and six inches of rainfall fell. British Army troops have been deployed to support flood relief supports in West Yorkshire, as well as Scotland. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it. The rapid response of the Army today will help with provision of flood relief to local communities in West Yorkshire. Storm Dennis claimed two lives yesterday - a -year-old teenager was died after entering the water at Herne Bay in Kent, while a man died near Margate - also in Kent - after going overboard from a Maltese-registered tanker that had anchored off the coast.  Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Steve Willington, said: “ Storm Dennis will bring another very unsettled spell of weather this weekend with a risk of flooding, particularly in parts of England and Wales and also southern Scotland, where snowmelt will add to the flood risk. With Storm Dennis bringing further heavy and persistent rain over the weekend, there is a risk of signicant impacts from flooding, including damage to property and a danger to le from fast flowing floodwater.

A full transcript of the Politburo Standing Committeemeeting on February  revealed that Xi was aware of the outbreak in January , just a week after the first coronavirus case was confirmed. He said: Since the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, I had listed a few requests in regards of disease control during the PSC meeting on January . On January , I have specically ordered the disease control department to stay alert and monitor the outbreak. I have also asked the party committee members, local governments and officials to place a high priority on the publicaposs health and safety. However, Chinaaposs state broadcast Xinhua fail to mention Xiaposs plan for the coronavirus outbreak, according to Hong Kong media. Millions of members of public expressed their anger over how local governments suppressed information of the deadly outbreak until Wuhan was placed on lockdown. A Chinese doctor who tried to issue the first warning about the illness was arrested and given warnings of aposspreading rumoursapos. Whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang later died of coronavirus in Wuhan, the epicentre of epidemic. The Chinese government has since fired provincial officials in Hubei and Wuhan as they were facing criticism over its handling of the outbreak.

He is still a child.  nThere is even no testosterone. And just to add, he still has childish sex organs. Puberty has not started. So we have a lot of questions.  nAccording to the girl, who is planning on keeping the child, she and her boyfriend take care of each other and set their social media as aposmarriedapos.  nThe schoolgirl said: Ivan has gastritis and I do not allow him to drink carbonated beverages. Sometimes I worry about my weight but he says that I am in perfect shape and do not need to go on a diet. He is very kind.  n  nDaria revealed that she and Ivan had sex at his home when his mother was away.  nShe said: After we did it for the first time, we hid from each other under the blanket out of shame.  nSoon after Daria started to feel sick and had nausea most days.  nThe girl’s mother Elena took her to hospital for examinations but doctors failed to find the cause of her aposillnessapos.  nFinally, Elena bought a pregnancy test kit for her daughter.  nElena, who was also participating in the show, said: The test showed that Daria was pregnant. After that, she confessed to having sex with Ivan.  nI was in shock. I could not say a word.  nWhen we started talking she said she would not kill the baby and I support her decision. I do not want her to go under the kne.  nIvan and his mother Galina, , are planning to help Daria to raise the child.  nGalina said: I did not know what to say after learning that my -year-old son fathered a child.  nI think Ivan himself does not quite understand what happened.  nHe said they came to our apartment and Daria offered him to have sex.  n  nThey did not use any contraceptives and obviously did not realise the possible consequences.  nSome of the familiesapos neighbours express doubts over whether the boy is indeed the father.  nA man living next door said: I think somebody  got the girl pregnant and now they want to put all the responsibility on the boy.  nAnd a woman said: I do not believe the boy is the father of the child. I doubt he is developed enough for that.  nFather-to-be Ivan said: Daria has never been with another man. I know that for sure. I am the father of her baby.  nThe children say they became a target for bullying in their hometown of Zheleznogorsk in central Russia’s Krasnoyarsk Krai region.  nDaria said: aposSome children from my school called me a w***e and said that I am sleeping around. I wanted to die after hearing that.  nTop news stories from nIvanaposs mother Galina said: People are mean and their opinions are often cruel.

According to the children they met each other a year ago and fell in love at first sight.

Paul Hartley played him further back in front of me and whoever I was partnering but I always felt he was more of a threat further up the pitch.“He creates real problems for defenders because they don’t know whether to follow him when he naturally drops back.“What Gowser does is take real care of the ball when he’s got it and he turns and can see a pass.“The ball he played through for Kane Hemmings’ second goal had to be right and he set the goal up.“I was delighted with Gowser up front and with Kane next to him.”With striking options limited following Danny Johnson’s departure in January and Andrew Nelson’s surgery, James says that plan would have been put to use the previous week against Morton.However, a knock picked up in training ruled McGowan out of the draw at Cappielow.And it was sporting director Gordon Strachan who reminded the Dark Blues manager of the possibility.McGowan started his career at Celtic while Strachan was manager at Parkhead and was given his debut in an advanced position.James added: “It’s something we would have done earlierwe could have.“We probably would have done it at Morton.“He started his career out there.

It was going in but Kane is a good striker and good strikers make sure –he wants the goal, he can have it!“The main thing was to get the win and a clean sheet as well – I would trade the goal for a clean sheet, to be honest.”Saturday’s shutout was Dundee’s first since they last met the Jags on December  and their first at Dens since October .“We got a lot of clean sheets at the start of the season and I think we came away from basing our game on that,” added Forster.“It’s nice to be back in the team, not quite scoring, but helping us get three points.“It was a blustery day and conditions on the pitch weren’t brilliant.“I think we made the best of it and got the best possible outcome.“The boys played well, we were really dficult to beat and we made a big thing of getting to second balls and closing people down.“We worked harder than we have been – that can be a hard thing to say to players but I think it has showed in the last couple of games where we have really got after teams and put them under pressure. Other teams do that to us and it’s dficult to deal with.”The victory puts Dundee back in the play-off spots as they retook fourth place.“The league is very tight. There have been a lot of tough games recently and I’m sure everyone was looking at the league table and saying ‘ we win this, we go there,we lose, we’re here’, that’s human nature.“We were fully aware of how big and important Saturday’s game was.“Come pm, we’ve won - and getting the three points is good news. It was a good day all round.”The Dark Blues head into a two-week break in good mood after ending their run without victory ahead of a trip to Queen of the South on February .“It’s human nature,you lose then there’s two weeks to think about that until the next one.“It was nice to get the three points after the previous few weeks and gives us something to work on for the next game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee emerge from the ashes and why lawrence shankland is just getting started","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan discuss how Dundee got their season back on track, Lawrence Shankland’s pledge that more is to come and the Walk and Talk men’s mental health event.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-wallace-bruce-glasgow-bishop-shaped-scotlands-history","story":"ONE of the most puzzling aspects of Scotlandrsquos wars of independence is the way that prominent figures often changed allegiances, especially in the period when Robert the Bruce was fighting for ndash and indeed murdering his enemies for ndash the throne of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"oz-glasgow-memories-judy","story":"THE story of Judy Garlandrsquos le continues to fascinate film-makers ndash the latest movie about the Hollywood star who shot to fame after playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, is currently lighting up cinemas and winning awards around the world."},{"url":null,"title":"70k-raised-place-mandela-statue-glasgow","story":"FUNDRAISING for a statue of Nelson Mandela in Glasgow has been stepped up on the th anniversary of his release from prison."},{"url":null,"title":"masterchef-star-gary-maclean-chats-new-bbc-show-corner-shop-cook-off","story":"MASTERCHEF winner Gary Maclean will star in a new show that aims to prove you can cook a three-course meal for just pound with items bought from your local corner shop."},{"url":null,"title":"mini-golf-course-set-st-enoch-centre-plans-approved","story":"A MINI-GOLF course is set to open in the St Enoch Centre, a move which will see world famous toy store Hamleys downsize."},{"url":null,"title":"public-can-help-shape-glasgows-response-ecological-emergency","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS response to the climate and ecological emergency can be shaped by the public after the council launched a new consultation."},{"url":null,"title":"dr-punam-krishan-farting-normal-talk","story":"Because everybody farts, itrsquos normal you see,"},{"url":null,"title":"city-science-plutos-journey-fascinating-one-planet-continues-surprise-us","story":"NEXT week marks  years since Plutorsquos discovery.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people.

Magdala Maria adds: ldquoWe have a steady number of young men joining which is always encouraging to see, so the future seems secure.Any rise in visitors and interest in Papa Stronsay is likely to be welcomed by the  islanders of Stronsay, just six minutes away by boat, where efforts have been under way for the past two years to lure more tourists.The seven-mile-long island, known as \"Orkneyrsquos Island of Bays\", currently attracts around  tourists a year to its rugged coastline, dramatic seascapes, sheltered beaches and history ndash flint arrowheads believed to be , years old have been found on the island.However, reaching Stronsay can be challenging: the five-times-a-week flight from Kirkwall to Stronsay takes just eight minutes, but spaces are limited the ferry may be cheaper but itrsquos an hour and a half just to get there.Reaching the monastery at Papa Stronsay means calling ahead and arranging for a boat.ldquoStronsay has put in quite an effort to lt its profile both as a holiday destination and somewhere to live and work. As well as housing and better ferry services, we need employment, says Stronsay-born and bred North Isles councillor Graham Sinclair.ldquoWhat holds tourism back is the lack of Scottish Government funding for a better ferry service. Itrsquos woefully poor compared to the Western Isles.Fresh hope has come from a controversial source: in October, go-ahead was given by Orkney Islands Council for two new fish farms ndash the first in the Stronsay area.Located in two of the islandrsquos three large sandy bays, they will occupy picturesque spots where grey seals, harbour seals, otters and other wildle currently thrive undisturbed.The Mill Bay and Bay of Holland fish farms will each comprise  circular cages, each  metres in circumference and both serviced by their own -tonne feed barge.Cooke Aquaculturersquos new farms will create up to nine jobs ndash however, some have questioned the impact on seals, fish stocks, crab and lobster, as well as expressing fears about the potential visual scar on the unspoiled landscape.However, Cllr Sinclair says the farms are largely welcomed: ldquoTherersquos a buzz on the island just now. The fish farms are in development stage, and thatrsquos brought a buzz over the prospect of new jobs in a small community.Fish have always played a role in the islandsrsquo industry: Papa Stronsay was once a centre for the herring industry, and at its height in the s, up to  people lived and worked there.At peak times, so many herring boats packed into the Sound of Papa that it was possible to walk across the boats from Stronsay to Papa Stronsay without touching the water.The fishing industry collapsed after the Second World War and native islanders left. Today, around % of Stronsayrsquos population is said to be made up of non-native Orcadians.According to Fr. Magdala Maria, a rise in visitors to the two islands would not adversely affect their peaceful solitude.ldquoWe are not concerned about an increase of tourism, in fact we welcome it, he says.ldquoOne can say that we have contributed to the influx of visitors to the island of Stronsay over the years. Many of our family members and friends have visited from all over the world, being an international community of monks.ldquoWe always encourage visitors to our island.ldquoAt the same time we want to keep our treasure, Papa Stronsay, a place of joyful silence and solitude, where people can come here to enjoy peace, tranquility and experience the presence of God."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-film-festival-one-mans-journey-depth-despair-top-world","story":"Standing on the top of the world with Everest under his feet and a dark, disturbing secret embedded in his heart, David Tait felt a kind of euphoria wash over him.Getting there had taken years of chaos and destructive behaviour. Friends, family and lovers had been trampled over, his hedonistic City traderrsquos lestyle and disregard for others had left a trail of misery in its wake.Conquering the worldrsquos highest peak brought a natural high that Tait, first raped aged  by a relative then appallingly abused throughout his childhood, had never experienced before.ldquoSomething extraordinary happened, he recalls. ldquoIt was euphoric, I never felt better. I realised I had found something.On the ,ft summit, years of suppressing the horrors of his childhood lted.Tait, a successful City trader and top banker with Credit Suisse who had already quietly resolved to turn those awful childhood experiences into a force for good, vowed to take the next step and share his distressing yet powerful story.Now a harrowing but uplting film that depicts how he overcame a childhood blighted by sexual predators and which scarred his journey into adulthood will receive its world premiere at Glasgow Film Festival.Sulphur And White, which stars Anna Friel as Taitrsquos broken mother and Fe-born actor Dougray Scott as his cruel father, throws light on the deeply distressing impact of child sex abuse and the ripple effect that shatters the lives of not only its young victims but those around them too.Using flashback sequences, it links years of abuse and suppressed hurt with Taitrsquos subsequent destructive and self-indulgent behaviour which triggered the breakdown of his first marriage and two suicide attempts.Although it is deeply disturbing, Tait says he is hopeful the film will encourage debate over the far-reaching impacts of child abuse, and help lt the stigma that may discourage victims from seeking support and avoid a descent into a troubled adulthood.ldquoIrsquod like the film to be a defining moment in recognising that the victim also creates many, he says, adding: ldquoThere are animals out there and all we can do is try to protect children.His ordeal began when he was just  years old while working for a relative in a tearoom in Deptford Park, south London. Caught pinching a chocolate bar, Taitrsquos punishment was to be brutally raped and warned not to tell.The assaults continued for an entire summer and included episodes involving groups of men, with the youngsterrsquos head covered with a sack to protect the identities of his attackers. Later, Tait was subjected to abuse from his own father.The film explores how that abuse affected his adult relationships and how, having been driven to the brink, he pulled back from taking his own le and resolved to stop allowing events of the past to dictate his behaviour.He went on to climb Everest five times and raise pound. million for childrenrsquos charity NSPCC, which supports young victims of abuse.Of the film, he says: ldquoI realised there was a chance to do three things. The first was to educate those who donrsquot understand what sexual abuse of children is. I know some remarkably clever people who, when they saw the film, turned to me and said they didnrsquot understand that went on. I thought everyone did.ldquoSecondly, therersquos a lot of collateral damage created by the victim ndash me. Over the years I have created so much mayhem. I want to destigmatise it, talk about [abuse] and bring it out into the open.ldquoThirdly, there was no NSPCC for me. And I hope the film will show that children donrsquot have to go through  or  years of misery before getting help.Tait, , first decided to speak openly of his childhood experiences as he prepared for his second Everest climb, signing off an email calling for support towards his fundraising for the NSPCC with the line: ldquoBecause I was one of those kids.His last Everest expedition in  almost ended in tragedy when he was caught in an avalanche.Sulphur And White is among nine world premieres at the -day film festival. Others include Flint, from Scotland-based director Anthony Baxter, which unravels scandalous betrayal and hypocrisy around Michiganrsquos water supply, and Pictures From Afghanistan which follows The Herald and The Herald on Sunday photojournalist David Pratt as he s to the country.More than  films will make their UK debut, among them Edinburgh-based Mark Cousinsrsquo -hour documentary Women Make Film, a tribute to women filmmakers which will be screened in five instalments, and Dirt Music starring Kelly Macdonald as an Australian outback we trapped in a miserable marriage.The festival closes on International Womenrsquos Day with every film screened that day either directed or written by a woman, or featuring a female lead.Mark Stanley, who played Grenn in the HBO series Game Of Thrones, and who portrays Tait in the film, and co-star Emily Beecham, who plays his we, Vanessa, and who last year won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her part in Little Joe, are lined up to attend the world premiere of Sulphur And White.The film tackles the complicated relationship between Tait and his mother, and explores how the support of his we and birth of his children brought new focus into his le.ldquoI feel dferent almost every time I see it, he says of the film. ldquoThere are one or two points regarding my mother that are devastating ndash two scenes leave me helpless every time I watch them.ldquoIt was probably harder for me to read the script than to watch the film. I realised this sequence of events in my le that seemed very disjointed had been crafted into something that was an interesting story.Sulphur And White will receive its world premiere at the Glasgow Film Festival on Friday, February , at the Glasgow Film Theatre, and be released in cinemas on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"senior-tories-want-second-referendum-claims-former-party-spin-doctor","story":"The idea of holding another vote has always been a firmly rejected by party leaders, with the official stance of \"No to Indyref\" appearing throughout the general election campaign of last year.The partys new leader, Jackson Carlaw, has also said he is against holding a second referendum.However Andy Maciver, the partys former head of communications and now director of think tank Message Matters, said he has been in several conferences and talks with leading party members who say they are in favour of holding another vote on the constitution.The former adviser said: \"The reality of next year is that it is all about how the Scottish Conservatives deal with indyref.\"There is one camp who thinks they have to say yes to indyref, and the other are saying It was once in a generation, the SNP are mucking up the country and people will realise that.:Jackson Carlaw elected new leader of Scottish Conservatives\"I have been involved in conferences on both sides here, but there are very senior people on both sides of this and that is a problem for the Tories.\"That is the biggest thing Jackson Carlaw has to deal with.\"Many of the Scottish Tories have got a hope that the SNP have got policy problems, in education and so on.

University researchers will explore the history of islands such as Coll and Tiree, Barra, Benbecula, Skye and Raasay as well as mainland sites such as Glen Coe, Lochaber and Wester Ross.They are looking for tales handed down the generations, such as those from the Clearances, when many of these areas were denuded of the communities which had been their leblood.Mass migration of Scots from the islands and crofts of Argyll and beyond to the New World will also be recorded, as will the myths and legends handed down from the ancient days when the west was the domain of the Vikings.Famous sons and daughters of these lands and the achievements they made during their lives both at home and abroad will also be featured.The project is run by the West Highland College UHIrsquos Centre for Recreation and Tourism Research , which was recently awarded a grant worth pound, from the Scottish Natural HeritageNatural and Cultural Heritage Fund.The centre has also secured match funding from the college itself and Caledonian MacBrayne , giving a budget of more than pound,.Sara Bellshaw, senior innovation manager at CRTR, said that it would help prevent folk memories and tales ignored by wider history from being lost forever.She said: ldquoIt is fantastic to have received this funding from the Natural and Cultural Heritage Fund and the additional match funding from WHC UHI and CalMac.

Combining these stories with practical visitor information aims to enhance the visitor experience along the west coast.ldquoCollaborating with communities, West Coast Waters, local destination organisations and industry experts is integral to this project, and we also plan to involve students wherever possible, including the Marine and Coastal Tourism students who are part of the School of Adventure Studies here at West Highland College UHI.The project is part of a new pound million Scottish programme of projects to invest in the Highlands and Islands to provide more high-quality opportunities for visitors to enjoy natural and cultural heritage assets.The Coast That Shaped The World is a community-led scheme, and people who live on the islands, and in towns and villages on the west coast, will be directly involved.A website and app with augmented and virtual reality will be developed to accompany the exhibitions, while maritime heritage stories will be brought to le through GPS triggers at the site of the events they talk about, to give people a tangible reference to the land and sea where everything unfolded.Led by the Centre for Recreation and Tourism Research, The Coast that Shaped the World is a large-scale collaboration between West Highland College UHI and the West Coast Waters tourism initiative.West Coast Waters is a collaboration of  west coast destinations and tourism organisations collectively representing over , tourism interests across the west coast of Scotland.

However, Steve’s natural talent and drive quickly meant that they were expanding and moved into Inverurie.Not long after the move Steve and Jim amicably parted ways leaving Steve as the sole proprietor of IK. Branching out and running the business on his own, Steve was never one to shy away from risks.As well as his ability to grab an opportunity with both hands, a critical aspect of Steve, and therefore, IK Motor’s success, is his commitment to going the extra mile for the customer.Steve commented: “Ultimately, it’s all about giving the customer a good deal, and letting them know that they can always count on us to come through for them. Our interest in the customer doesn’t end when they purchase a vehicle, we make sure they get good service afterwards.” This commitment to customers extends to the wider community at large, with Steve always making the effort to give back and ensure that Inverurie shares in IK’s success. He said: “In Inverurie there is a particularly strong sense of community. Even though it’s expanded considerably, that sense of cohesion is still there, and we love to be a part of that.“Every year we try and do what we can to give something back. On our th anniversary we raised over £, for CLAN. Last August, we organised a ball at Meldrum house and raised over £, for Macmillan Cancer Support.”“We support local football teams and local sports in general, but I can’t take sole credit for what we do, without the support of my family, friends, the business, and the people in and around the town it wouldn’t be possible.” data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Storm Ciara damage.\"  Storm Ciara:  of the most shocking photos of the damage flooding left in its wake viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Looking to the future, Steve shows no signs of slowing down having recently entered the property development sector and is near completion of a new build facility for international supplier screw fix, with a number of other projects in the pipeline."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie auctioneer join iaas","story":"An auctioneer from Inverurie has been welcomed to the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in Scotland .Ellis Mutch is one of six Scottish students in year three of the Livestock Market Operations and Management course at Harper Adams University in Shropshire and was presented with his associate membership certicate by IAAS President Scott Donaldson.The certicate in higher education he is working towards is seen as the professional standard for entry into the livestock auctioneering sector.

Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March .

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt. HIE must be properly supported to continue their role in providing an alternative.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country. Ferries in Orkney and Shetland are a leline service, not a luxury to be bargained year after year.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One by one, they planted the rough wooden memorials in the grass –  in all – each one marking a le lost to drugs. As they did so, they reflected on the good times, and lamented the waste.The last to plant his cross was Steven Currie. Steven’s older brother Peter McGrattan – known to most as Big Ped – was obsessed by music. “He was into punk when he was a boy, then U, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses, Oasis,” says Steven, who has the word “Brother” tattooed on his arm. “He was the man for the music, and you would follow suit because you looked up to him.” Steven would sit on the floor while Peter played DJ. “I’d tap tap my feet and think: ‘That’s quite good, that.’ His taste was superb. He could have been one of those guys that spotted bands.”But Big Ped carried a bit of weight and it affected his self-esteem. He trod that well-worn path from alcohol through soft drugs, heroin and crack cocaine, on to the grave. He died of a Valium overdose, after eight years clean, in August , dying in their mother’s house. “The paramedic came in and said: ‘He’s gone,’” Steven says. “I sat with him on the floor and cuddled him until they came and took him away.” Gone, but still loved still remembered.We are in the grip of a drugs deaths emergency here in Scotland, as everybody knows. Our drugs death rate is the worst in Europe. The toll for  was , – the highest it has ever been. It will come as little surprisethis year’s is higher still. The crosses are a reminder that each of the , was an inidual robbed of their future.En masse, they capture the scale of the problem. Spread out in rows like war graves, they say: “Here is a generation being wiped out, while those at the top play politics.” Is this too harsh  Maybe. Yet even as Steven placed his cross, the UK and Scottish governments were squabbling over rival drugs summits to be held in Glasgow a day apart. “My drugs summit is better than your drugs summit,” they blustered like children.Of course, politicians on both sides can justy their position. The UK government will say it announced its conference first. “But without consulting us, and without including those with lived experience,” the Scottish Government will counter. If either party does not understand how pathetic it sounds – how pathetic it is – for two governments who share responsibility for drugs policy to be unwilling to cut the crap and share a table, I suggest they get out of politics for a while and look at this from beyond the bubble. I suggest they spend some time in those communities where people are losing their lives for want of inter-agency collaboration and a coherent policy.This is not to suggest the Scottish Government is doing nothing. Last year – under pressure, and having previously cut frontline services – it set up the Drugs Deaths Task Force. In the recent budget it announced an extra £.m to be spent on “delivering innovative projects, testing new approaches and developing a national pathway for opiate substitute therapy”.The Scottish Government conference will also provide training in the use of Naloxone, which reverses the effect of drugs overdoses, and a demonstration model of a drugs consumption room. It insists what takes place there will “inform” its contribution to the UK summit the next day. And yet the mutual blame game neither side appears able to stop does not augur well.So often we hear about successful policy where, particularly in Portugal where drugs have been decriminalised, users have been de-stigmatised and those who consume can choose between harm reduction and rehab.But the key to Portugal’s success was not merely the approach itself, but the political consensus that formed around it and an unshakeable commitment to that approach through successive governments.Here in the UK, we are still treating drugs policy like a political football a forum for the airing of grievances a battleground for ideological dferences. This was happening long before the general election, but it is worse now the Tories have a thumping majority.The destructive relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Government – and more specically between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson – is spilling into other areas too, most notably the COP climate conference which will take place in Glasgow in November.This conference is supposed to build the coalition necessary to break the deadlock on international climate action – and therefore requires UK-wide co-operation and a gt for diplomacy.Already, however, it has been reduced to oneupmanship. Despite being advised otherwise, Johnson has refused to give Sturgeon any formal role in proceedings. And there have been disputes over the venue itself. With the conference set to be held in the Scottish Events Campus on the north of the river, the Scottish Government booked out the Science Centre on the south. But now the UK government says it needs both sites and has accused the Scottish Government of trying to undermine its plans. To make matters worse, the Prime Minister is said to have referred to Sturgeon as “that wee Jimmy Krankie woman” to which Sturgeon responded “ Boris Johnson wants to make personal insults against me, I’m a big enough girl to make personal insults back”. All highly constructive.I think most of us accept Johnson would try the patience of a saint. As last week’s reshuffle demonstrated, he – or rather Dominic Cummings – is hell-bent on exercising control. Claire Perry claims he sacked her as the president of the COP and replaced her with former international development secretary Alok Sharma because Whitehall couldn’t cope with an independent conference. Sharma is said to have a questionable record on environment issues.Given all this, it must be tempting to answer criticism by pointing out that “Johnson started this” and that he is a twat of the highest order. But that gets us nowhere. Meanwhile, the planet burns.Aware, presumably, that tit-for-tat fighting is destructive and childish, Sturgeon has called for a reset in relations. But for that to happen, the UK government will not only have to be willing to co-operate on key issues, the Scottish Government will have to stop constantly passing the buck southwards.The constitutional debate is not going to disappear. Both governments will be arguing over the legitimacy of a second independence referendum for some time. But they need to be able to set that argument aside when it comes to shared crises such as drugs deaths and climate change.Only by attempting to find common ground can progress be made. If that requires pride to be swallowed, and teeth to be gritted, then so be it. There are too many crosses already in Springburn too many species already extinct. Enough with the playground politics.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm nuisance neighbour sajid javid feels smack of firm leadership","story":"The Prime Minister#s predecessors would have understood his demand for unquestioning loyalty from the Treasury, writes Euan McColmIt was greeted as evidence of a crisis at the very heart of government.When Sajid Javid resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer on Thursday, after rejecting Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s demand that he sack all of his advisers, opponents scented blood.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell observed that Johnson had “clearly won the battle to take absolute control of the Treasury and install his stooge as chancellor”. We must surely, he added, be witnessing a historical record – a government in crisis after just two months in power.Meanwhile, Labour-supporting commentators lined up to explain the replacement of Javid with, as one columnist described him, the “alarmingly obedient” Rishi Sunak.I’m bound to say that for a man mired in crisis, Johnson appears remarkably relaxed. When he and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, told Javid they wanted his team cleared out and replaced by a new staff of advisers working across both  and  Downing Street, they must have know there was a chance – a good one, at that – that the chancellor wouldn’t wear it. His decision to walk cannot have come as a shock.McDonnell’s description of a government in crisis is, I’m afraid, inaccurate. Rather, what we’re seeing is a Prime Minister fully in control. There is no crisis.In Javid’s eager beaver replacement, Johnson has precisely what he wanted: a compliant chancellor who will do what he desires.Quite why Sunak’s loyalty should be seen as “alarming”, I’m not sure. There is nothing in the rule book of politics that says the sign of a good chancellor is a willingness to defy the prime minister. Was Tony Blair’s Labour government improved by the fact chancellor Gordon Brown spent his every waking moment seething with resentment over his rival’s supremacy  No, it wasn’t, was it  In fact, briefing and counter-briefing by Number  and Treasury sources meant the fractured relationship between prime minister and chancellor frequently got in the way of smooth government. When both men would rather have seen their policy agenda make headlines, their bitter relationship became the focus of media attention.When, finally, Brown realised his ambition of becoming prime minister, he could not change his ways. A man born to plot, Brown soon began undermining his chancellor, Alistair Darling, destroying a professional and personal relationship that had endured for years.David Cameron and George Osborne entered government in  having learned from their predecessors. Relations between Downing Street and the Treasury were good for the first time in a long time.Cameron and Osborne were a team and they always understood the pecking order. Each got what he needed from the relationship.But Johnson has no such partner. The Prime Minister has no political soulmate.This being so, what, exactly is the problem with Johnson wishing to take a firm grip of the Treasury  It is, I think, the sort of thing that might look to voters like strong leadership. Few, I’d wager, now lament the passing of the Javid era.Among Johnson’s immediate priorities is solidying the Conservative vote in areas of England which once ed Labour MPs. The Prime Minister will want to deliver for areas in the Midlands and the North of England which went Tory for the first time in generations. If he does not make good on his promises of regeneration and investment then the PM risks watching those voters drt back to Labour.What Johnson needs, right now, is a chancellor who is completely on board with this agenda. But there is something  beyond the Prime Minister’s desire for a compliant chancellor at play, here. Johnson has just sent a message to every member of his parliamentary party that the rules of the game have changed. His demand is complete loyalty, nothing less.From what McDonnell describes as a crisis will, I think, spring a period of uncommon stability in government. Last year, Johnson won the parliamentary majority he craved. Now, he has stamped his authority on his party in no uncertain terms.This same message came across loudly and clearly in Johnson’s dismissal from his cabinet of former leadership contenders Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey. Leadsom is a popular figure among members of the Tory Party’s Eurosceptic right wing. Johnson’s calculation is that he need not concern himself with the feelings of those members. Javid comes out of the last few days rather well, I think. No chancellor can complain about a demand for loyalty but the order to dismiss his team of advisers was a step too far, one provocation too many.That Javid said no to this suggests he has something about him, after all.In a statement following his resignation, the former chancellor reiterated his support for Johnson. I wonder how long this will last.It is undoubtedly the case that when political parties lose discipline, they lose elections. Look at the SNP. For decades, they did nothing but tear each other apart over the best way in which independence might be achieved. Bitter recrimination was part and parcel of SNP membership. And then Alex Salmond ed as party leader for a second stint and he laid down the bloody law to his colleagues. There was to be no briefing about colleagues, no criticism of government policy, and no public disagreement over any of the party’s positions.What followed was as period of unity in the SNP ranks that continues – the occasional domestic disturbance, aside – to this day.I’m not sure Johnson is behaving especially dferently to the way Salmond did. Doubtless, opposition parties will taunt Chancellor Rishi Sunak when he next rises to speak in the House of Commons. They will leave him in no doubt that they consider him a poodle.But each and every one of Boris Johnson’s opponents will privately admire the way he strengthened his grip on the Tory Party last week.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

The picturesque village sits on the Rhins of Galloway, the name given to the distinctive hammerhead peninsula on the southwest edge of the country.On paper, the distance from here to Larne seems trling. Just over  miles separate Portpatrick from Northern Ireland. Bridges have successfully spanned greater distances in many other parts of the world.But those crossings didn’t have to deal with the terrying depths and changeable weather that seafarers in this remote corner of Scotland know only too well.“I’ve worked offshore for  years, and I would rather face the North Sea on a bad night than the North Channel,” says Calum Currie, who helped lead the local buy-out of Portpatrick’s harbour in .It’s a Thursday afternoon and, by Wigtownshire’s bracing standards, a fairly calm February day. The sun is dazzlingly bright and the wind, while noticeable, isn’t strong enough to blow you off the pier.“See that red sandstone block ” Currie points at a colossal stone which sits incongruously on the breakwater. “That weighs around six tonnes. The waves can pick those up and hurl them over the harbour wall. In winter, the swell in the harbour can reach eight feet.”The North Channel offers regular reminders of its awesome power. During exceptionally bad weather in December , passengers aboard a PO ferry bound for Cairnryan feared they were going under when the boat suddenly lurched downwards – toppling articulated lorries like dominos in the process. It is across such waters that Boris Johnson hopes a bridge can finally be built. Civil servants have been asked to come up with a workable plan for a seemingly impossible challenge.Residents in the Rhins of Galloway are being asked by the UK government to think big. Instead, they’re more likely to shrug. The Prime Minister’s grand plan is merely the latest contribution to a debate that has spanned four centuries.“It seems a wee bit fancul,” is the assessment of June Hoad, chair of Portpatrick community council, who has lived in the area all her le.“It would be nicewe were to be consulted in all of this. So far we have heard nothing.”The question of how best to cross from Scotland to Ireland is one that has never been definitively answered.Some of the greatest engineering minds of the modern era were determined that Portpatrick was the solution.John Smeaton, the man hailed as the father of civil engineering, set about in the late th century to make the village a suitable port for regular mail packet sailings to and from the Emerald Isle. He proposed two breakwaters to enclose and protect the village bay. But efforts to construct a northern breakwater failed as a result of the destructive powers of the sea and were abandoned in .John Rennie expanded on Smeaton’s ideas in . A new south breakwater and lighthouse were dutully completed by  – only for a storm to undermine the pier head just three years later. Work on the unfinished northern breakwater was soon abandoned.By  both the mail boats and ferry services had switched from Portpatrick to Stranraer, which sits in the sheltered waters of Loch Ryan.Fast forward to  and Stena Line quit Stranraer to open a new deep water port in Cairnryan, six miles up the coast – a decision the company insisted was necessary to cut costs and reduce crossing times.But few people seem satisfied with the current arrangements, which see both PO and Stena Line operate from two separate terminals.For  years passengers could alight from the train at Stranraer and kill time in its many pubs or hotels before boarding the ferry. Irish banknotes were accepted by many local businesses. Now the town’s east pier and its vast lorry park, formerly home to Stena Line, stand empty – a visual reminder of Stranraer’s diminished status.The current ferry terminals in Cairnryan are grim, utilitarian efforts with few amenities for passengers.There is no rail link to either dock. The thousands of HGVs that use the ferries must navigate the A, which runs south from Ayr, or the A, which runs east from Dumfries.These roads do not resemble vital economic links between two nations.It is dficult to describe the depth of unhappiness the A and A cause the residents of Wigtownshire. Only the A to Inverness – which is now being dualled at fantastic cost – can rival their claim to be the most despised trunk roads in the country.The condition of the roads don’t just affect iniduals – it hurts the economy as well.Stena Line, PO and the Belfast harbour authorities last year collectively called on Transport Scotland to upgrade the A and A to dual carriageway as a matter of priority. The trio said such an investment was required to prevent loss of business to better connected ports in England and Wales.Transport bosses responded that they had already invested heavily in both routes and ruled out making them dual carriageway along their entire .“I’d like to see Boris Johnson drive here without being chauffeured,” says Carly MacDougall, a member of Portpatrick community council, when the subject of his bridge proposal is raised.Residents in the village have lost loved ones who could not be transferred in time from Stranraer’s small hospital to better equipped facilities in Glasgow.Locals joke that more babies are born on the road to Dumfries than in the town’s maternity unit itself. Speak to anyone in Portpatrick or Stranraer about the possibility of a bridge to Ireland and the conversation soon s to one crucial question: how can they even think about such a project when the existing roads are so bad The region’s poor connectivity is an issue the Stranraer  Wigtownshire Free Press has asked again and again over the years.It is one of the few weekly newspapers in Scotland not to have fallen into the hands of the big media conglomerates, and unlike many other local titles, retains a visible presence in the centre of the town it serves.Jenner Jones recently moved from Glasgow to Portpatrick after taking up a job as a reporter on the paper. While greatly enjoying her new le, she admits the condition of roads in the area leave a lot to be desired.“There is a delicate balance,” she said. “It’s a great tourist attraction. People love it down here because it feels empty.“But you look our through archives and the same arguments were being made  years ago.“MSPs all say the same things regardless of political party. They promote the region – but it feels too easy to ignore it.”John Cooper, a veteran newspaperman, agrees. He was brought up in Stranraer and ed to take charge of his hometown newspaper last year.“It is a dferent world down here,” he says. “People talk about it being ‘the forgotten corner’ of Scotland. It’s almost like an island.“Stranraer has been promised so much over the years that talk of a bridge just washes over people.“Every party has struggled with the transport issues down here over the decades – and in the end nothing gets done.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"labour leadership contest exposes glaring rift on response to scottish independence debate","story":"Labour isions over the prospect of a second referendum on independence were laid bare as the candidates vying for the UK leadership and its deputy role clashed in Glasgow yesterday.Frontrunners Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey appeared split over the constitution. The former pledged not to impose policy from London on the Scottish party, while Long-Bailey made it clear she would grant a second referendum on independencethis was requested by the Scottish Parliament.Scottish party leader Richard Leonard had earlier warned that future policy on the constitution must be made north of the border.Long-Bailey insisted Labour would never rejoin a cross-party Better Together-style body in the event of a future referendum – prompting an angry rebuff from the party’s only Scottish MP for “trashing” the victorious  pro-Union campaign.Labour’s new leader and deputy leader will be unveiled on  April. Yesterday the three leadership candidates, including Lisa Nandy, faced off in a hustings event at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow.Independence featured heavily as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon demands the right to hold a second referendum on independence after the SNP’s landslide election victory north of the border in December.Starmer insisted he will work with the party in Scotland. “There won’t be any imposition from London, I’ll be working with Scottish Labour.”He said whether or not Holyrood should have the power to stage a fresh ballot on the issue was “an interesting question”, but added: “We shouldn’t get sucked straight into that.“The SNP are constantly using the constitutional issue to mask the real issues, andwe get into that we are falling into their trap.”Leonard had earlier warned, in what he described as his “abiding message” to the UK leadership hopefuls, that the position on a second referendum must be settled north of the border.“The policy of this Labour party on Scotland’s constitutional future must be written here in Scotland by a Scottish Labour Party and written by us alone.”But Long-Bailey again made it clear that she would not block a second independence referendumthis was requested by the Scottish Parliament, warning such a barrier would drive voters “into the arms of the SNP”.“As a democrat I have to say thatthe Scottish Parliament makes the request for a referendum I don’t believe that as a democratic party we could refuse that,” she said.The pro-independence SNP-Greens majority at Holyrood voted in favour of a second referendum last month.And in a move which appeared to cut across the autonomy of Scottish Labour, Long-Bailey added: “We can’t fall into the trap like we did last time where we joined forces with the Conservative party in the Better Together campaign. “Nicola Sturgeon wants to paint us as a party of the establishment and we’re not.”She was backed by deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon, who said it would be “counterproductive” for a UK government to intervene.“If the Scottish people desire another independence referendum then Westminster shouldn’t block it,” he said.He added that sharing a  with the Tories in Better Together saw Labour come across as part of the establishment which has left a “damaging electoral legacy”.None the less, both Burgon and Long-Bailey insisted they were opposed to independence and would campaign against it.Scottish Labour’s position on the constitution had previously been marked by its opposition to another referendum. But this was thrown into disarray last summer when Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced during a trip to the Edinburgh festival thatJeremy Corbyn was prime minister, his government would not block a second referendum on independencethis was requested by the Scottish Parliament.But Ian Murray, member for Edinburgh South, and the only Labour MP in Scotland to survive Labour’s dismal election performance last December, dismissed this approach on the constitutional debate and pointed out that the SNP won less than halfof the popular vote in the election.“Let’s stop dancing to the tune of our opponents,” said Murray.“There’s no mandate for a second referendum –  per cent is not a mandate.”“And secondly, let’s never have a senior member of the Labour party come to Scotland during a UK general election and throw the Scottish Labour Party under a bus.”He insisted that Labour must be clear in its opposition to both independence and a second referendum and warned against the “extreme nationalism” being proposed by the SNP as Scotland prepares for the Holyrood elections next year.He added: “We will never win in  unless we are strong on the constitution, and being strong on that constitution starts with not trashing our record in government over  years, and second, not trashing the way we saved the country in .”Murray campaigned on behalf of the Better Together campaign in the  election.The referendum issue has split Labour in Scotland, with senior figures like health spokeswoman Monica Lennon claiming Holyrood should be allowed to decide on the issue after the SNP’s election victory in Scotland.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch dramatic footage shows ferry caught in storm dennis","story":"A ferry swaying heavily at sea as storm Dennis batters parts of the country has been caught on camera.Stuart Bell was visiting the Isle of Arran when he filmed the ferry approaching the Calmac Ferry Terminal.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It’s time they packed up and disbanded.”Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly’s attendance at a PSNI recruitment event was hailed by Chief Constable Simon Byrne as “seismic and historic”.It was the first time such a senior Sinn Fein figure had attended such a meeting, although the party has expressed support for police in Northern Ireland on many occasions in the past.Last year there were attempted bomb attacks by dissident republicans targeting police in Belfast, Craigavon in Co Armagh and near the Irish border in Fermanagh.The New IRA and Continuity IRA are involved.Police have branded as “cruel and disgusting” anti-PSNI recruitment posters depicting an officer who was severely injured in a bomb attack.The posters used a picture of Peadar Heffron along with a warning that anyone thinking of joining the police could suffer similar injuries.Mr Heffron lost a leg when a dissident bomb detonated under his car near Randalstown in  as he travelled to work.

Many of the pupils at Ballougry PS have a family link to the school and children come from as far afield as Eglinton and Donemana to be educated there.We have children whose parents, grandparents and even great grandparents have been at the school.The parents have such fond memories of their time here that they want their children to enjoy the same type of education, no matter where they are living.Mr OKane believes that attending a small primary school equips children well for the transition to secondary school.In a small school setting you have to get on well with everyone and the children thrive on it.In bigger schools you can jump around friendship groupsthings arent working out, but here you just have to work it out.We were very happy with out recent transfer test results and our children will be moving on to every post primary school in the city.”Mr OKane concluded: The feedback that we always get is that the children really do represent us well.Among the schools best known past pupils is renowned actress, Amanda Burton, well known for her television roles, including Heather Black in the Channel  soap opera Brookside, Beth Glover in Peak Practice, Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series Silent Witness, Clare Blake in The Commander and Karen Fisher in Waterloo Road.Her father was a headmaster at the school. googletag.cmd.push Photos: Tom Heaney   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an ‘Embrace the Giant Spirit’ event organised by Tourism NI, actors Stephen Rea, Tara Lynne O’Neill and Laurence Kinlan, musician Neil Martin and the singer-songwriter Lisa Hannigan, gave a unique and moving performance to celebrate Seamus Heaney’s work at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin.The programme was curated by Seamus Heaney HomePlace, the literary centre in Bellaghy, Co Derry, which takes visitors on a journey through the le and literature of the poet, with an invited audience including members of the Heaney family, representatives from the local tourism industry as well as arts, culture and media.The performers came together as part of an initiative which aims to highlight the literary connections between Seamus Heaney HomePlace, which recently reached its , visitor milestone, and the hugely successful ‘Listen Now Again’ exhibition, which draws on the National Library’s extensive Heaney archive and has welcomed over , visitors since it opened in Dublin in July .Featuring powerful performances of Seamus Heaney’s work, including an adaptation in words and music of an excerpt of Aeneid: Book VI and a haunting performance of Anahorish by Lisa Hannigan, the event comes as HomePlace prepares to extend its visitor experience into the landscape which so inspired the poet and which features in his work.A total of  locations of signicance to Seamus Heaney are being developed, notable among them being Lough Beg a place of ‘special memories’ for the poet where a boardwalk will lead visitors to a newly constructed viewing point to see Church Island and its famous spire, with extracts of poetry audible, as well as visible along the route. A riverside walk by the Moyola River is also being created and a newly commissioned sculpture will form the focal point for visitors to hear and read poetry at the eel fishery in Toome. Visitors will also be able to download an app, which will allow access to augmented reality as they journey through each location.Fiona Cunningham, RoI Market Manager for Tourism NI said, “With the impressive Seamus Heaney HomePlace, situated in Bellaghy, only two and a half hours from Dublin, visitors can really immerse themselves in our greatest poet’s writing and discover many areas of his beloved hometown that inspired so much of his work.“Over , thousand have visited the Dublin exhibition since it opened in , and many may be unaware of the very unique and spiritually moving experience one can also get when visiting Heaney HomePlace. Visitors are coming from all over the world to soak up the beautul place, people and landscapes in Northern Ireland that inspired him so much and we want to encourage people from across Ireland to make the unforgettable trip to follow his journey, walk the paths he took and explore through his words at Seamus Heaney HomePlace. We are really inviting you to embrace our giant spirit in NI and to awaken your own.”HomePlace also recently opened its new Tourism NI approved Visitor Information Centre, offering a range of new services for visitors to learn about further immersive activities, places to visit and stay in the area. Chris Heaney, son of Seamus Heaney, said: “It’s a pleasure to be here this evening to celebrate Seamus Heaney HomePlace and to highlight its outstanding events programme of readings, concerts and performances”.Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Martin Kearney, commented, “We in Bellaghy and Dublin share our custodianship of a signicant legacy and this evening HomePlace has been very pleased to be curating here, sharing also a taste of the experience our visitors have in our performance space.“We hope that we will continue, inidually and collectively, to celebrate all our writers and the great literary talent which has emerged from this island. There is a momentum building across Ireland and an opportunity for us to create a cultural tourism network across the entire landscape, North to South, East to West, where we and our visitors can embrace a ‘giant literary spirit’”.Brian McCormick, manager of HomePlace said: “We want to extend our sincere thanks to Tourism NI for hosting such a special evening and for continuing to highlight the incredible opportunities there are, through HomePlace and Listen Now Again, for visitors to engage with and be inspired by Seamus Heaney and his work”. The latest Seamus Heaney-related investment is valued at over pound,, with % funding from DAERA and the remainder from Mid Ulster District Council which owns and operates Seamus Heaney HomePlace.To book your short break to Northern Ireland visit: www.discovernorthernireland googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That feeling of love and happiness between the three of us was just perfect. This led to a conversation between my son and I, and later his girlfriend and his dad, about what holding hands means, about the memories it provokes and how we hold hands.How we hold hands  I hear you ask, don’t we all hold hands the same  Well I thought we did but no we don’t. . There’s the palm together hand hold, the fingers entwined hand hold, the just fingertips entwined hand hold and there are more. Which one you are, my son told me, depends on who you are holding hands with! Well I disagreed I always hold hands in a palms together way - but apparently that’s just a mummy hold according to my son!. Yes, his dad disagreed, but my son’s girlfriend didn’t.So, what does holding hands mean, what does it make us think, what does it make us feel and remember  George was smiling as he remembered his grandad holding his wrist - yes, his wrist not his hand - to cross the road. George said he really didn’t like this as he was about eight years old at the time but he does remember letting his grandad do it because he thought it made his grandad happy. His dad laughed when George said this and told George his grandad did the same to him – hmmm, I wonder, will this become a family tradition  I remember holding hands with my mum lots of times, but most of all I remember her sliding her little finger up my wrist as she held my hand and that this would make us both laugh together. My son’s girlfriend said, although she remembered holding hands with her mum, she also remembered always holding hands with her best friend everywhere they went. Personally, I can remember telling my son that he had to hold my hand when we were out so I didn’t get lost - great excuse to keep him safe. I had this same “holding hands” conversation later that week with my friend who told me she loved holding hands with her little one as they sing row your boat and with her older child who loves to walk on the walls in front of people’s houses. I think a favourite of mine, apart from that with my son nieces and mum, of course , is when I am in school or nursery and I see all the children holding hands with mum or dadchattering away and smiling together. I’m smiling as I’m writing remembering all these things - I know you’ll have your own happy hand holding memories too. It’s a simple gesture but does show how much we care, how much we love, does send a message of caring through touch, does support a loving bond, can help us feel, and give, security and a feeling of belonging to each other. googletag.cmd.push But, as our babies, toddlers and children grow into pre-teens the hand holding begins to disappear - unless you are lucky enough to have an affectionate teenage daughter.So, enjoy it today, remember the feeling of those little hands in yours, take time to hold hands together whether walking along, sitting and watching tv or singing a simple rhyme. For these memories will take you through the stroppy teenage years - teenage years wherein their idea of holding hands with you in public is just the most embarrassing thing ever, and all the way to Grandparent days!!!Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre. We are looking at the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre location and build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 Down Cathedral.jpg","title":"Down Cathedral receives recognition for tourism  ","story":"DOWN Cathedral in Downpatrick has been officially recognised for giving visitors a warm welcome.The Welcome Ministry of Down Cathedral received special recognition from CIE Tours International at a recent awards ceremony in Dublin.The awards were based on feedback from over , CIE customers surveyed throughout the year.Dean Henry Hull and cathedral administrator Sharon McVeigh collected the award at a ceremony at Dublinrsquos Christ Church Cathedral last month.Down Cathedral was one of only seven locations in Ulster to receive a merit award, along with Hillsborough Castle and the Giantrsquos Causeway.Dean Hull explained that welcome is at the heart of our ministry in Down Cathedral.ldquoOver , people visit the cathedral each year.

He hopes, however, that he has allayed their immediate fears by stressing that he would not tolerate bad behaviour on his premises.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs. She said this not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town.Cllr Mason said that housing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site.She added: ldquoThe bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road. The new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that Ms Mallon will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.He said: ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch, but the wider South Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 New Queens.jpg","title":"New queens of Ulster  ","story":"ST Maryrsquos High School, Downpatrick, lted the prestigious Erne Cup for the first time at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena, Cookstown, last Wednesday afternoon with a blistering display of attacking football.Victory was no more than the local girls deserved when they gained revenge for last seasonrsquos heartbreaking cup final defeat to the same opposition.St Maryrsquos started the game strongly and turned their possession into scores with an early goal from Saulrsquos Cara Doran settling the nerves.The Enniskillen girls were simply not allowed to play their vaunted expansive game and Katie Convie raced in almost immediately to make it - to - when she capitalised on a poor kick-out.St Fanchearsquos had no intention of giving up their title without a fight and replied with three consecutive points. However, a buoyant St Maryrsquos outfit replied with points from Cora Convery, Alishia Lundy and Shannon Sloan to maintain their six-point lead.Six points quickly became  by the half-time break as St Maryrsquos continued to terrorise St Fanchearsquos and scores from Doran , Abi Murphyand the lethal Shannon Sloangave the locals a commanding - to - lead.St Franchearsquos came out fighting in the second half, scoring a goal and two points without reply to reduce the arrears to  point, but that was as good as it got as St Maryrsquos quickly regained the initiative and went for broke.They certainly put the foot on the gas and points from Erin Sands, Katie Convie and Cara Doran had St Maryrsquos well clear St Fanchearsquos kept on to the bitter end and forced a great save form St Marys goalkeeper Fia McFaul as they tried to get back into contention.However, McFaul and her defensive wall of Keely OrsquoNeill, player of the match Nora Maguire, team captain Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy and Lucy Morgan kept St Fanchearsquos at bay.At midfield, Eimear Teggart and Erin Sands dominated throughout the game and kept their dazzling forward busy with a constant supply of good ball.Abi Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convery, Shannon Sloan and Katie Convie were literally unplayable and gave the St Fanchearsquos defence a torrid time all afternoon.St Maryrsquos: Fia McFaul, Keely OrsquoNeill, Nora Maguire, Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy, Lucy Morgan, Eimear Teggart, Erin Sands, Abie Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convie, Shannon Sloan, Katie Convie.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

The clear message from voters of all parties was that our Province could not continue to drt after three years without local decisions on everyday issues like our roads, schools and hospitals.By Arlene Foster, First MinisterSaturday, th February , : am\"\"Arlene FosterAlthough the New Decade New Approach deal is not perfect it was fair and balanced. We should take the elements about respecting each other’s identity and use it as the vehicle for promoting a vibrant and prosperous Northern Ireland, as an active and integral and part of the UK, as we approach the centenary of the place we are proud to call home.Those pretending that the political vacuum of the last three years was in Unionism’s best interests offer only a short-sighted strategy. That is not the position of the DUP. The reality is that people living in every part of Northern Ireland whatever their political outlook, want delivery of effective frontline services, not the ision of a border poll or distraction of recycling the Brexit debate. Despite some of the spin, the  RTE exit poll showed almost one in five of SF voters didn’t even support a border poll. Instead % prioritised healthcare.We should not be complacent in defending and promoting the overwhelming benefits of being part of the UK. However we should not lose sight of the fact that the best defence against those who wish to take us out of the UK is to create a socially thriving and economically prosperous Northern Ireland. A Northern Ireland where everyone feels at home and where everywhere has a genuine and active stake in determining their future. Despite its accepted weaknesses and frustrations, devolution is still the key to this. Yesterday I attended a business breakfast in the Castlereagh Hills. There I presented my vision of making our Province a better place to live, work, grow up, raise a family and do business. That means building a dynamic and successful regional economy. Protecting first and foremost unfettered access for trade with Great Britain, in both directions, and ensuring local interests are met in the implementation of Brexit. It means pursuing better infrastructure connections both with Great Britain and between dferent hubs of jobs and growth within Northern Ireland. This will increase the number of households seeing practical benefits of living their lives within the fth largest global economy.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is not in the wider interests of unionism to allow the brain drain to continue. We are committed to working with domestic and international businesses to identy skills gaps and create better links between education routes at all levels and the needs of employers not just tomorrow but in five or ten years’ time. All the while ensuring affected sectors like agri-food and hospitality have access to the outside labour they need in the short-term. At the same time we have to showcase Northern Ireland, building on the strong tourism brand already established. Earlier this week the Tourism NI’s Visitor Attitude Survey reported that % of visitors to Causeway Coast and Glens thought it met or exceeded expectations. The future for Northern Ireland as a positive brand is bright. The possibilities are limitless and we will work proactively with the newly appointed Cabinet Minister for the Constitution and Devolution to make even further strides.Last year the DUP began work on developing a “Next Generation Unionism” approach. This work continues and we must seek to be pro-active in developing our case rather and building the broadest possible support. I am clear that restoring Stormont isn’t a barrier to a vibrant and forward-looking brand of Unionism. It presents a fresh impetus that we must be ambitious to exploit. The road will not always be easy. There will be challenges. However this is how we will protect the interests of unionism and secure Northern Ireland’s place for the next  years. We all have a role to play in this process and I look forward to getting started.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It’s a conversational well that is unlikely to run dry given the numerous prompts that adorn the walls, the rails and the display counters.Northern Ireland might not be as big a force in world football as the likes of Germany, France and Brazil, but per capita the Province punches well above its weight in terms of a fanaticism for football, be it the Irish League, the national team or an adopted team in England or Scotland.Mugs featuring the Irish Leagues finest: Glenn Ferguson, Gregg Davidson, Chris Walker, Billy Caskey, Jamie Mulgrew, Joe Gormley and George McMullan \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The shop which was opened in August by Ryan Gilmore, , and his business partner Pete McDonald, , taps into the rich demand for memorabilia amongst the nation’s football mad population.It leans towards the local game, celebrating the old kits and legendary stars of the Irish league, and immortalising national heroes such as Best, Whiteside, Jennings and more latterly Evans, McAuley and Healy. Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health.

On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: \"The Historical Environments Division is a section of the Department for Communities whose responsibility is to protect historical sites in Northern Ireland and therefore safeguard our heritage.In respect to Knock Iveagh on the outskirts of Rathfriland - a prehistoric burial site date back to  years BC and the site where the inauguration of medieval Irish Kings took place - the HED has failed and they have failed miserably. In fact had it not been for the ‘Friends of Knock Iveagh’, a public interest group, this Neolithic site would have destroyed by development that should never have been allowed.\"Having asked written questions of both the Ministers for the Communities and Infrastructure it is clear that their failing from  has led us to a situation where they have now passed the issue onto Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council planners.\"This has put the local government planners in a dficult position. If they were to apply enforcement orders on the developers on Knock Iveagh, the ones that were given permission to develop by the Department for Infrastructure and were not stopped by the Department for the Communities, then there may be a massive compensation or legal cost for such action and that will be passed to the rate payers of the local council area. \"How can it be fair that the rate payers of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon could pick up the cost of the failings by DfC and DfI.\"It is time that both DfI and DfC - who have the powers to put Knock Iveagh back to the way it was before they mistakenly gave authority for a wind turbine development - to step up and take the financial responsibility for their mistakes. The government sponsored vandalism of a site scheduled for protection under the Historical and Archaeological Objects Order is a disgrace but allowing local council to pick up the cost compounds the damage started in  and should not be acceptable.\"A Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: “Councils are responsible for the proper administration and lawful processing of their own planning and or enforcement cases. The Department recognises the concerns and strength of feeling but, under the Transition Provisions for the transfer of the majority of planning s to the new Councils in April , responsibility for planning application permission does now lie with the Council. “The planning and enforcement issues in what is a highly complex case are also a matter for the Council. “A spokesperson for ABC Council said: “The Council is currently considering a number of Planning matters in relation to the site at Knockiveagh including requests to revoke discontinue planning permission for the wind turbine.“All of these planning matters remain under consideration at the present time,” said the spokesperson.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2743935.jpg--.jpg?1581604995000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
