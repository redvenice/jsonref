Photos of the garment would appear to confirm Lund\u0027s story, as the bustier worn by Abdul looks identical to the one created by Lund           Lund (pictured with Cindy Crawford in April) says the garment is one of a kind and could not be replicated without the use of master beaders and weavers, and requires a process that takes at least five days to complete          Lund, a childhood best friend of Kim Kardashian (pictured together in their early teens), made the bustier eight years agoBut after getting no response from the singer, 56, Lund says she now has no choice but to sue the \u002780s icon for the return of her item.\u0027I don\u0027t know how she came to have it, I\u0027m not saying she stole it or her stylist stole it or anything,\u0027 Lund said in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV.\u0027I would just like to get it back – it\u0027s obviously my piece.\u0027Abdul\u0027s representative declined to comment on the bustier when approached by DailyMailTV, except to note that the publicity photo was taken two years ago.Lund\u0027s lawyer Stephanie Ovadia told DailyMailTV: \u0027I was retained to see the return of the property after she attempted to contact Paula to no avail.\u0027We are currently in the process of contacting Ms Abdul for the swift return of the property.\u0027Lund, a childhood best friend of Kim Kardashian, made the bustier eight years ago and says creating it took her five days.She told DailyMailTV the piece has sentimental value because her grandmother helped her to create it.\u0027My grandmother helped me make it,\u0027 Lund said. \u0027She sat with me for a few hours and I had a deadline to get it done and she actually weaved some pieces on for me to help me. It\u0027s a very important piece to me.\u0027          The design, which was created from a mixture of silver metallic thread and chiffon, was hand-sewn and was later worn by celebrities, among them Gwen Stefani, Britney Spears and singer Roselyn Sanchez (pictured)           But after getting no response from the singer, 56, Lund says she now has no choice but to sue the 80s icon for the return of her item          Lund (pictured with Kim Kardashian in their younger years) said: \u0027I don\u0027t know why it would be so hard for them to give it back to the rightful owner. It is important to me. I just want it back\u0027The design, which was created from a mixture of silver metallic thread and chiffon, was hand-sewn and was later worn by celebrities, among them Gwen Stefani and Britney Spears.Lund says the garment is one of a kind and could not be replicated without the use of master beaders and weavers, and requires a process that takes at least five days to complete.She says the garment disappeared from her showroom four years ago and assumed it had been taken by accident which is why she never reported the missing item to police.Lund said: \u0027I didn\u0027t report it to the police and the reason why we didn\u0027t is because I figured at the time, it would have been returned, it would have come back.\u0027To be honest, what are the police going to do with a bustier gone missing? They don\u0027t take something like that as seriously.\u0027I figured that through friends and through time, I would eventually get the bustier back. I always honestly thought I would get the bustier back.\u0027\u0027Every moment of life should be savored\u0027: Paula Abdul shares...Kaia Gerber steals the Versace show in flamboyant suit as...Share this article    Lund says she does not want to make an enemy of Abdul but is now hoping to have the piece returned without further problems But despite her hopes, the garment was not seen again until the release of Abdul\u0027s publicity photos, which Lund saw for the first time over the weekend.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it,\u0027 she told DailyMailTV. \u0027I felt two things – I felt elated and I felt excited I could possibly get my piece back again.\u0027But I also felt a little angry because it reminded me that somebody had obtained that piece dishonestly and that doesn\u0027t mean that Paula Abdul did, it doesn\u0027t mean that her stylist did, it means that somebody took that piece and it ended up in her hands and I just hope she does the right thing and gets it back to me.\u0027 Lund says she does not want to make an enemy of Abdul but is now hoping to have the piece returned without further problems.

Emoitional: The Talk is also looking a frequent guests hosts Carrie Ann Inaba and Carnie Wilson per sources close to the production (Inaba in tears in the day Chen announced her exit)          Off they go: Chen is staying on for the next season of Big brother despite leaving The TalkThe Talk has used this tactic in the past as well, most recently prior to the show\u0027s decision to hire Eve.A host of women came on as guests hosts, including singer Michelle Williams and Inaba, after the departure of Aisha Tyler just before the start of the eighth season.Eve was not named as Tyler\u0027s replacement, however, until November, right in the middle of the most important time of the year for any television show - sweeps.It would be no surprise if history repeats itself, and a tune-in to unveil the new host comes in late October or November.In the immediate aftermath of Chen\u0027s departure Inaba stepped in to take her place as did Wilson, with more guest hosts slated to drop by this week. Chen announced the news at the end of the show\u0027s episode on Tuesday in a taped message, fighting back tears as she shared her decision with viewers.She had not yet appeared on the show\u0027s ninth season, and announced that she would be going on indefinite leave last Monday after CBS forced her husband to resign as CEO and chairman.Ten days later she made the leave definite, stating: \u0027I have been at The Talk since the day it started nine years ago and the cast, crew and staff have become family over the years.\u0027Right now I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son. So I have decided to leave The Talk.\u0027CBS applauded the hosts in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday.\u0027For eight seasons, Julie Chen has co-hosted The Talk with incredible energy, grace and professionalism. Her talents played a big role in our successful launch of CBS’ first network daytime talk show, and in the series growth into an Emmy Award-winning broadcast,\u0027 read the statement.\u0027All of us here have tremendous appreciation for the dedication and passion she brought to the show every day and for her generous role as an ambassador for CBS Daytime. We are grateful for her many other contributions, respect her decision and wish Julie all the best in everything she does.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/24/16/509CAB7A00000578-0-image-a-74_1537803280880.jpg","title":"Best deals scrapped supermarkets pledge half Britains food waste","story":"    British supermarkets, food manufacturers, restaurant chains, pubs and hotels are pledging to halve food waste.

By 2.30pm she was experiencing pains every five or six minutes.She went to the toilet and passed a blood clot and by 5.04pm she was actively bleeding, nauseous, faint and weak.By 6pm the pains were nearly every minute and an emergency caesarean section was carried out.Miss Mears was under general anaesthetic and when she woke up she was told Millie-Rae had not survived.

The process happens at this time of year and can depend upon many factors including the animals age and the latitude at which they live.Deer antlers are used primarily  to battle other male deer for mating rights. Male deer grow their first set of antlers when they hit puberty, at approximately one year of age.When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027.          Gary Kramer, 70, captured a barren ground caribou shedding its velvet at Denali National Park, Alaska          When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027. Although there is a lot of blood, the process doesn\u0027t cause the deer any discomfortBy late summer, when testosterone levels are at their peak, the blood vessels shut down around the base of the antlers and they harden into bone.Although there the antlers shed bloody red velvet, the deer do not feel any discomfort from the outgrowth.Velvet peeling typically takes a day or two to complete and those lucky enough to witness this process will often see the deer rubbing their antlers against tree branches.  Hunt for killer tigress: India\u0027s most-celebrated hunter is...These funny photos are guaranteed to make you smile!

Her vagina may just have been written out of history. While there was no absolute proof – and one blazing bit of contradictory evidence – it was until now generally believed that this Irish model and artist posed for one of the most outrageous nudes of all time, Gustave Courbet’s 1866 painting L’Origine du monde. A new discovery by a French researcher suggests it is not her after all on that bed but a dancer called Constance Queniaux.I’d like to put in a word for Hiffernan. Putting a face to the woman in this painting may seem a contradiction in terms. We only see her torso, thighs, her breasts, and her lovingly painted, gloriously triumphant and powerful sex organ. Yet it’s particularly tempting to imagine Hiffernan’s features hidden under that white sheet. It not only gives this picture a fuller human identity but adds a carnal dimension to some other very beautiful 19th-century paintings.It would also make my life a lot easier, OK, if we can stick with Hiffernan because I identify her as Courbet’s world-creating sexual being in a book I’ve just finished. The editor is going to love me making a pedantic pudendal revision at this late stage.James Abbott McNeill Whistler’s Symphony in White, No 1: The White Girl is an ethereal vision of shimmering monochrome paleness that seems to transport us far from the sensual realm Courbet painted. Only the bright red lips and hair of its model anchor it in the fleshly world at all. This is a painting of Hiffernan clothed. She became Whistler’s lover in 1860 at a time when this flamboyant American was negotiating a unique avant garde career between Paris and London. The White Girl may look like an aesthete’s refinement of pre-Raphaelite dreams of poetic womanhood, but when Whistler submitted it to the Paris Salon in 1863 it was rejected along with Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe and shown instead at the Salon des Refusés – one of the great events in the birth of modern art.So even before Hiffernan posed as Courbet’s revolutionary nude – supposing she did – she was at the heart of Paris modernism, provoking the traditionalists with her abstract shimmering into a whiter shade of pale.Whistler’s most powerful portrayal of her gets us closer to the flesh of Courbet’s picture. In his painting Wapping, done between 1860 and 1864, he brings the insolent realism of Manet to London’s docklands. In front of a riverscape of Manet-like painted silkiness, we see a woman in conversation with two men. She leans back sensually against a railing over the olive river, her loose red hair not only revealing her identity as Hiffernan but also suggesting her freedom from Victorian morals. In fact Hiffernan is playing a prostitute. Wapping was so famous for its sex trade in the mid 19th century that JMW Turner’s executor John Ruskin imagined a pub the artist owned there must have been a brothel, where he went to draw his secret nudes.Hiffernan is a strong, characterful, daring presence in Whistler’s avant garde paintings and it makes a great completion of her adventures as a model if she also showed everything in the boldest painting of the age.You’ve probably noticed the very obvious problem, even before documentary evidence pointed to a new candidate – her red hair does not match the dark brown pubic mane of Courbet’s nude.Against that is the fact that she spent time with Courbet in 1866 and was probably his lover. She does apparently appear in his painting The Sleepers, of two naked women in bed together, which was done that year for Khalil-Bey, the Turkish diplomat and lover of erotic art who also commissioned The Origin of the World. So Hiffernan was working and in all likelihood sleeping with Courbet in the year he painted his most outrageous masterpiece. And Whistler was an artist famously attracted to colour for colour’s sake. Maybe he exaggerated the redness of his girlfriend’s hair.For me, the jury is out. Joanna Hiffernan still has a claim to have possessed the Mona Lisa of vaginas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cfe1a253f8ba344b095b0127ab9a2f5a15e3690/393_720_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f0e54912c46aef2a7671c06dacebbe8","title":"royal navy photographic competition winners in pictures","story":"The winners of the Royal Navy photographic competition, the Peregrine trophy awards, have been announced.

Her novel imagines those last moments It was the manner of her death that was so brutal. It was gruesome. When Louisa Collins became the first woman hanged at Darlinghurst jail and the last woman hanged in New South Wales, the executioner botched the job. The trap door didn’t open, and then, after being banged with a mallet, it did open, and she fell through with so much force that her head was nearly severed and her windpipe left exposed.It was an image, says author Janet Lee, “that stuck with me, the image of the woman on the scaffold. Here was this woman who had never been known to confess, who expected a reprieve – was that what she was thinking in those last few moments?”Collins had walked calmly to her death on 8 January 1889, stoic, pitiful, believing her life would be spared at the last minute. “They will never hang a woman,” she had declared in the last hours of her life.Her death was controversial. A saga covered in salacious detail by the newspapers of the day, fiercely debated in parliament, heavily petitioned by the men and women of the colony. The 41-year-old mother of 10 children had endured four trials for the deaths of both her husbands, allegedly by arsenic found in rat poison she was one of the only people in the world to be tried four times for murder.The evidence against her was circumstantial. She had nursed them both as they lay dying of similar violent stomach illnesses. One trial for the wilful murder of her first husband, Charles Andrews, and two for her second husband, Michael Collins, had returned hung juries – all of whom were men, 36 in total. The crown pressed on with a fourth trial, for Michael Collins, and finally got their guilty verdict. The chief witness was her 11-year-old daughter May, who testified that she had seen a box of the poison Rough on Rats in the kitchen.Louisa Collins represented a threat to the men of the colony, and her story was political. In opposition, Sir Henry Parkes had argued for mercy in a previous hanging case for rape. Now that he was premier he was decidedly in favour of the hanging of Louisa, who thundered that the alleged murder of her second husband was “one of the most cruel, inexcusable, and frightful murders ... in the world’s history.”Doctors who attended Michael noted that Louisa had been drinking alcohol, and the police reported that she was inebriated when arrested – unseemly behaviour for a woman. It was reported that she was “cold” in the courtroom during her trials. “She didn’t show a lot of expression, something that might have been held against her,” says Lee. “She wasn’t typical of that era, she was not weeping or weak.”Even so, she begged for her life in a letter to Govenor Carrington two days before her death. “Oh my Lord. Pray have mercy and pity on me and spare my life. I beg and implore you to have mercy on me. I have seven children ... spare me my Lord for their sake.”Lee’s novel The Killing of Louisa is written in the first person, as Collins awaits the gallows and talks about her life to the priest.Lee says: “In my head this is very much fiction I have picked out little pieces of the story and imagined things around those. There were hundreds of newspaper articles, I went and revisited all the primary sources the NSW archives has the judges records written in this beautiful spidery hand writing. I used the facts as we know them as a guide, and tried not to stray too far.”She describes how hard life was for poor, working-class women. Louisa was born in Belltrees, in the Hunter Valley, and was sent away at 14 to be a domestic in the Merriwa home of a solicitor, where she became a “country coquette”, it was reported.At the urging of her mother she married the local butcher, Charles Andrews, at 18 he was 13 years older and she later said “had always been boring”. She had children in quick succession, two dying in infancy, and the family moved to Botany. But it was a drudge feeding all those children, washing, cooking for the boarders the family took in Louisa would retreat to the pub.“They had incredibly hard lives, the clothing was so restrictive,” Lee says. “It just would have been every single day boiling the copper, washing clothes, lugging the water the day to day effort of that era would have just worn you down, everything was so labour intensive.”Louisa could also be overly fond of the boarders, in particular the much younger Michael Collins, whom Charles threw out in a fight in the street and who, Lee says, “was a bit of a rogue”. Collins was soon back after Charles’s death. Louisa was very eager to get Charles’s will drawn up as he lay dying, and rushed to collect his insurance policy after his death. She did not wear black mourning clothes, instead throwing a party and dancing with her lover. She was pregnant when she married Collins three months later their child, John, died in infancy, and 13 months after their marriage, Collins too was dead.It is hard to see what her motive might have been for this death: a woman with so many children had no way of supporting herself she needed a husband. By then the insurance money was gone – Michael Collins was a gambler.Lee’s book follows on from the 2014 book Last Woman Hanged: a meticulous five-year investigation into Louisa’s life and death by Caroline Overington. Neither woman will speculate on whether Collins was guilty. “I know enough to know I don’t know,” says Lee.“I don’t know if Louisa was guilty,” Overington tells  Australia, “but neither, beyond a reasonable doubt, did the fourth and final jury nor did the judge who sentenced her to hang, despite the prosecution having no weapon, no witnesses, and no motive for the death of Michael Collins.”The women who petitioned for Louisa would go on to form the suffragette movement. “There was an enormous move in Australia at that time to give women more rights women were starting to fight for the vote.”Louisa Collins represented a threat to the men of the colony, her story was political.“How can it be,” says Overington “that we know the names of the bushrangers, the gold diggers, the explorers, but not this fascinating story of a woman who faced four juries on a charge of murder. Our silence has allowed braying mobs to form around other women both in the dock (Lindy Chamberlain) and in the court of public opinion it allowed the framing of women as calculating and manipulative to continue for another century it encouraged the idea that a sexually adventurous, curious, rebellious woman – Louisa liked to drink and dance and be in love – is immoral, a danger to society. We must dispense with her at once!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d35582318b52bca12782789ad045faf28369425f/93_0_4721_2832/master/4721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6382f62113f14102bd87b7772066cec2","title":"ryyanair cancel 190 flights cabin crew strike action","story":"Cabin crews across Europe plan industrial action on Friday in latest dispute to hit airlineRyanair has cancelled 190 of its 2,400 scheduled flights on Friday blaming strikes by cabin crew based in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy and Germany.Ryanair said it “sincerely regrets these unnecessary customer disruptions”, which it blamed on agitation from staff at rival airlines.Friday’s action will further damage the airline’s reputation in the eyes of the travelling public, who have been wary of making future Ryanair bookings because of the threat of industrial action.In August, the low-cost carrier was forced to cancel nearly 400 flights as it battled unions in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. About 50,000 passengers had their travel plans disrupted, leaving a trail of unusable hotel, car hire and other bookings. There was similar disruption in July.The long-running industrial action by Ryanair staff centres on working conditions. Staff based in countries other than Ireland are unhappy that Ryanair has been employing them under Irish legislation.Employees say they are compelled to receive their pay in Irish bank accounts, which affects their credit rating at home. Ryanair said it has agreed to move to local contracts, law and taxation as quickly as possible next year, but with conditions attached.Ryanair said in a statement: “Ryanair sincerely regrets these unnecessary customer disruptions, which have been called by unions at the behest of competitor airline employees.The airline’s Kenny Jacobs said: “These repeated unnecessary strikes are damaging Ryanair’s business and our customer confidence at a time when oil prices are rising strongly, and if they continue, it is inevitable that we will have to look again at our capacity growth this winter and in summer 2019. We hope these unions will see common sense.”Rory Boland, the Which? travel editor, called on Ryanair to save its customers holidays. “The airline must now immediately arrange alternative flights or provide a full refund and pay out compensation to those affected – including the many people still waiting for the money they’re owed from its shambolic summer of cancellations”Anyone who has booked a Ryanair flight on Friday 28 September was advised to check their inbox and mobile phone to see if their flight is among those cancelled.

But if 40 years of Versace has taught us anything, it’s not to underestimate the brand or Donatella, the woman who has steered it since her brother Gianni’s death in 1997.Michael Kors quit studying at New York’s acclaimed Fashion Institute of Technology just nine months after enrolling in 1977 when he was offered the chance to sell his own designs at Manhattan’s Lothar’s boutique, where he had a part-time job.Kors – born Karl Anderson Jr – soon had his designs in Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale’s. However, his company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1993, after a partner firm stopped selling his lower-priced designs under licence.The company was revived by an investment from LVMH, which was part of a deal when Kors joined as the group’s Céline brand as creative director. Kors floated the company on the NYSE in 2011. The shares soared in 2014, making Kors a billionaire.In recent years his signature tote bags, with gold MK swing fobs have become the brand’s trademark – at around £250 they are seen as affordable luxury. However, the company has been struggling with falling sales and in 2017 announced plans to close 125 stores to re-establish the label as a more exclusive brand.“For the luxury conglomerate landscape, these two companies might not seem like natural bedfellows,” said Kathryn Bishop, the deputy foresight editor and luxury sector specialist at The Future Laboratory. “But Michael Kors could bring much-needed modernisation to the label in an era when sexy doesn’t sell quite like it used to, and perceived Italian rival Gucci continues to innovate, winning the attention and spend of younger, globally minded shoppers.”In the 24 hours since it was first reported a deal with the American investor was imminent, Versace has been inundated with messages on her official Instagram account from followers imploring her to reconsider the sale. “Please don’t sell Versace to MK!!! That would be like Gucci selling to Primark! Versace is worth so much more than 2 billion and MK knows it,” said one.Confirmation that Versace will continue to lead the creative side of the business will help appease critics.Bishop agrees with John D Idol, chief executive of Michael Kors, in thinking the acquisition of Versace can follow the same trajectory, as well as helping the company to become one of the US’s most powerful conglomerates.“It comes at a time when both brands have witnessed a slowdown of sales, meaning both businesses could potentially draw on one another’s strengths and expertise,” she said. “This takeover is likely to position the future of Michael Kors and Versace alongside the accessories-focused group Tapestry Inc, which includes Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, rather than powerhouses Kering and LVMH.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0436121665dab8b8832c4f46ce475c3397f67e6/0_118_4381_2629/master/4381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69cb6c6c50b0eecae1519a933c410231","title":"keir starmer brexit zinger labour conference remain option peoples vote","story":"Labour’s Brexit boss set the conference alight when he revealed that remain could still be an option on a people’s voteKeir Starmer’s speech to the Labour conference in Liverpool was significant for two reasons: for what it said, and for how it went down. As usual, time will tell but both the speech and the response have the potential to push Labour, and Britain, towards the eventual, but still improbable, reopening of the entire Brexit issue.Starmer isn’t one of the great natural party conference orators. You still feel that he is learning how to perform some of the baser political skills that don’t always come naturally to a senior barrister. But there was no missing the zinger that he launched into the Liverpool hall towards the end of a well-argued speech about Brexit – or its effect.All the focus before Labour’s Brexit debate today had been on the second referendum. The speculation centred on how Starmer and the party would navigate the delicate politics of Labour’s conditional embrace this week of a “people’s vote” on the Brexit outcome this autumn.When he got to that part of his speech, Starmer was unapologetic. If Labour cannot bring down the Conservative government over Brexit this winter, there have to be other options, he said. These must include a campaign for a public vote.Starmer avoided getting too deep into the theology of what might be on the ballot paper – the issue that had ranged John McDonnell and Len McCluskey against the party’s pro-European majority in the last 48 hours. But it was the words that followed that set the debate alight.“Nobody,” said Starmer, “is ruling out remain as an option.” The response in the hall to that was immediate. First an instant volley of applause, but then, from deeper in the hall, and somehow also from somewhere deeper in the gut of the party conference, came the cheering, prolonged and surging, and then the standing ovation.It was a powerful moment. As someone who has been reporting party conferences for a very long time, I can’t remember all that many like it in any party. It’s rare for a politician, even addressing their supporters, to hit the spot with something truly unexpected and powerful. But Starmer’s embrace of the possibility of remaining in the EU hit that spot unerringly. It was, it seems, an improvised addition to the speech. The words weren’t in the planned text. But the words mattered – and so did the response in the hall. Most were on their feet. The applause went on and on. This was, it suddenly felt, a Labour party that really is up for a fight to preserve Britain’s place in Europe.That won’t have gone down well with those in the Labour party who see everything in terms of whether it is a challenge to the leader. But Jeremy Corbyn, along with McDonnell and McCluskey, does not want to see Labour drawn down the road of refighting the issue of UK membership of the EU. The reasons for that caution differ: some, like Corbyn, are anti-EU others, perhaps like McDonnell, are more pragmatic.In his closing words, Starmer seemed to be aware of that. The millions who voted for Brexit sent an immense message about the state of Britain, he acknowledged. Much of the rest of the conference Brexit debate was ill-focused and without the quality that Labour remainers will need to summon if this is to go all the way. But Starmer has started something here. He is going to have to carry it through. And, judging by the response in the hall – not always the most reliable guide to public opinion, it has to be said – there are plenty of people willing him on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cadbd128c9e4b0dd82fbf9a6e5edde1490a0fbea/0_337_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09915cf404a55be9b7c0e64dea050c2a","title":"labour betray leave voters brexit keir starmer second referendum","story":"The EU referendum forced us to acknowledge that people in large sections of the UK had lost faith in political parties and the Westminster elite. While for some, closer integration with the EU had brought greater prosperity, many leave voters felt their jobs becoming under threat, their prospects and those of their children narrowing and the public services they rely on coming under growing strain. The vote in the EU referendum was a fundamental rejection of what our membership of the EU had become, and was an indictment of the failure of successive EU and UK leaders to listen to the concerns of ordinary voters.On Tuesday the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, to a standing ovation, moved Labour towards being the party of remain. He said Labour would support a second referendum on EU membership which could overturn the 2016 vote. It is hard to know where to begin. Working-class voters across the UK overwhelmingly voted leave. Research during and after the campaign shows they wanted the UK to take back control of its borders, laws, money and trade – something that even the Chequers deal fails to deliver.But instead of seizing the opportunity to turn against Chequers, the Labour party is turning against its traditional voters. They had been drifting away from Labour since 2005, but in 2017 some returned at least in part because Labour’s manifesto said it would respect the result of the referendum.As the party of remain, Labour will turn its back on the concerns of millions of its traditional voters and will have chosen, scornfully, to ignore the largest democratic vote in this country’s history. That is a very strange and worrying position for the Labour party to be in.This is a conclusion that Keir Starmer came to in 2017.

Democracy in action is ugly in a different way, more like a jumble sale: mess, chaos, mountains of tedium, elbows everywhere. You have to stay alert because you know that underneath the polyester there’s something – not wishing to overextend an analogy, let’s call it a second vote on Brexit – that you would treasure.The Labour conference in Liverpool this week had that jumble sale feel. In any process that is remotely pluralistic, there are too many people in the room. And so 150 Labour delegates met to discuss their composite Brexit motion, boiling 150 motions from different constituency parties down to one single motion, which was passed  this afternoon.It was a heroic, multi-houred marathon on which there were scores of perspectives, none of which was “Hallelujah”. Most of the motions that were fed in had a strong anti-Brexit flavour, and were firmly supportive of a referendum on any deal. They were opposed by a loose collection of the cautious, lefty Brexiters and ultra-loyalists who would prefer not to hold the leadership to anything. The final motion read as a series of conditional measures: if the government is defeated, but if a general election isn’t called, then Labour will campaign for a public vote, whose terms are yet undecided.The post-match analysis seemed to be that this was a defanging of the members, all the better to roll them over later. In fact, this is what participation looks like: frustrating, iterative, inconclusive and interpretable. I’m told one memorable point of the meeting was Keir Starmer saying: “Right, now we have to agree what we mean by ‘consensus’.” The mind boggles as to how they kept it to five hours.In a period of flux, as a party moves from one version of democracy (nominal) to another (meaningful), proceedings are garishly splenetic. The week began with a vote on proposals from the party’s year-long democracy review. From the outside, it all looks ridiculous, tautologous, self-referential: what kind of a party has, as the first line of its agenda, a battle over its own rules?At its kernel, inevitably, was the issue of how easy it is for local party members to deselect their Labour MP. Momentum wanted mandatory reselections, which would see all Labour MPs face a selection battle against challenger candidates before every general election. It got another fudge instead: a lower threshold for triggering a full reselection selection process. Now it will happen if a third of local party branches and affiliated trade union branches express dissatisfaction with the local MP, rather than a half.The argument in favour of mandatory reselection is unremarkable and straightforward. On the one hand, if an MP is chosen by party members, why should that choice be immutable? Circumstances change the composition of the party changes MPs change. My local MP, Kate Hoey, appeared at a Brexit rally last week with Nigel Farage and David Davis. The idea that Hoey represents Vauxhall Labour party – which is fiercely anti-Brexit – is flat-out silly. On the other hand, internal contests use energy that could be directed elsewhere – towards one’s political opponents, for instance.It’s a debate that could play out quite reasonably, both sides having clear elements of truth and strength. But emotions run so high that pragmatism doesn’t get a look-in. MPs who oppose mandatory reselection say their duty is to all their constituents, not just to Labour party members, much as a parent is bound to love all their children equally. The MP Stella Creasy delivered a stinging critique of “toxic” Momentum at a rally: “If you think being political means sitting in meetings … you can do one.”If a political party is to mean anything, there has to be a mechanism that connects members to its decisions. Those members must, by definition, carry more weight than constituents who aren’t members, with the obvious proviso that anyone who wants more weight can always join. Otherwise, it’s not a democratic party – it’s a kind of political burlesque, where MPs put on a show of representation and party members distinguish themselves by cheering the loudest.But democracy is extremely painful: even if everyone were courteous, which we know they aren’t, participation is challenging. It doesn’t respect seniority. People cannot really be disciplined, only persuaded. Being political actually does mean sitting in meetings, and worse: having no control over who else is in the meeting, or what they think.It has become fashionable to say, in weary amusement, that Labour is replaying the 1980s that this is a cul-de-sac in which it has lost itself before, from which it will sooner or later emerge. But the goal is not to return to a Labour party where we can all move along because there’s nothing to see: it’s a pluralistic ecosystem so densely populated that differences cannot be obliterated by fury or stamped out by discipline, only resolved through creativity.Two days after that composite meeting, Starmer committed to a second referendum with a remain option on the ballot. It was all anyone wanted: not to erase the referendum, just to revisit it in light of the disaster of its unfolding.It was, as one conference delegate described, the result of “ordinary people making sound decisions, for the many not the few”. That’s the distinction of democracy.

Instead we see the impact of this irrepressible force on our coastline roughly every six hours, when the tide is high and when it is low.The British coast has some of the mightiest tides in the world – the Bristol Channel has the second biggest rise and fall after Nova Scotia – and two  photographers, David Levene and Christopher Thomond, spent much of the summer exploring how the tide’s ebb and flow reveals different worlds.Arnside in Lancashire. Photographs: Christopher ThomondThomond relied on his naked eye to line up each high- and low-tide image. “I found them quite a struggle – technically it was difficult to line the two pictures up in your head,” he admits. “I’d find a vantage point at low tide and come back eight hours later and the markers I had in my head to line up the image had disappeared.”Thomond says people probably imagine taking pictures of tides at beautiful coastline spots to be a rather lovely holiday job, but the reality was he had to squeeze in the work between more mundane tasks. The “pure practicalities” – particularly getting two pictures in good light – overtook any pleasure in admiring the liminal world revealed and then covered by the tide, he says. “I didn’t choose a view, set up the tripod, wait for six hours and take another picture. I shot five or six scenes from the same area and tried to get some variety and replicate each one. You could never quite predict how somewhere was going to look at high tide.”Fossil hunting at Lyme Regis, Dorset. Photographs: David LeveneLevene tried to begin with a compelling low-tide picture. The biggest challenge was obtaining the high-tide picture of Lyme Regis on one of the hottest days of the year. He took the low-tide image of fossil hunters from the top of a fragment of eroding cliff that was only accessible at low tide. “I then had to wake at the crack of dawn, come down with a coffee and suncream and walk out at low tide and wait for the high tide, so I was sat out there in the heatwave for about eight hours.”The Wash from Snettisham, Norfolk. Photographs: David LeveneLevene was often too busy trying different photographic positions or checking tidal apps to experience the meditative beauty of the ebb and flow of the tide. But he was moved by the unexpected drama of the North Sea flooding over great expanse of the Wash at Snettisham.“The way that the water came in through the mudflats was just amazing,” he says. “It takes forever to come in but for the last 40 minutes the channels suddenly fill up. I was taking pictures all the while.”Taking the photographs from exactly the same position was sometimes unexpectedly difficult. Levene imagined he might mark the spot for his tripod and return six hours later, but in often busy places or natural beaches it wasn’t possible to leave a durable mark.Instead he used his eye. “You’ve got to fidget yourself into the right position by looking at the original picture you’ve taken and use reference points from it,” he says. To get a really precise match, Levene also plugged his camera into his computer at his tide-watching spot to overlay the original picture with the new image revealed by the camera.Crosby beach in Merseyside.

Whale experts said the animal appeared lost but seemed to be swimming strongly.British Divers Marine Life Rescue, which specialises in saving marine animals in distress in UK waters, has sent a specialist vet to the Kent town to monitor the whale’s movements.Julia Cable, the charity’s national coordinator, said: “It is swimming strongly and appears to be feeding, so there is no indication that it unwell or acting strangely. We are not particularly concerned about its welfare apart from the fact that it really shouldn’t be there.“We do have someone going down to keep an eye on it and report it. We are hoping it is not going to get in any trouble.”Cable pointed out that sightings of beluga whales in British waters were very rare and that she believed the last sighting was three years ago off the Northumberland coast. “They are an Arctic species so they usually swim around Greenland or Svalbard, a lot further north,” she said.Adult male beluga whales can grow to more than 5.5 metres (18ft) in length and weigh up to 1,900kg (4,190lb).Cable said it was possible the specimen in the Thames was forced south of its usual habitat by last week’s storms.Dave Andrews, a consultant ecologist, was one of the first to identify the whale while birdwatching near Coalhouse Fort in East Tilbury, Essex.Under a video posted on Twitter just after 11.30am, he wrote: “Can’t believe I’m writing this, no joke – beluga in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort. It’s been feeding around the barges for the last hour and hasn’t moved more than 200 metres in either direction.”By 3pm live helicopter footage of the scene showed a Port of London Authority (PLA) boat patrolling the estuary off Gravesend. The PLA confirmed there was a whale in the Thames and urged other boats to “keep a safe and respectful distance”.Marine mammal experts at the Natural History Museum in London initially said that clearer images were needed to definitely identify the whale as a beluga and that it could be another cetacean species with albinism.But after examining footage, its whale expert, Richard Sabin, said its appearance and behaviour suggested “very strongly” it was a beluga.Estuaries are one of the belugas’ favoured habitats, but they also live in deep ocean basins and among loose ice, the museum said.A spokesman for the RSPCA said: “We are working with other agencies to monitor the situation and ready to provide appropriate assistance if requested.”Danny Groves, from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: “This is a high Arctic species thousands of miles from where it should be in Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea. They are usually associated close to the ice. He or she is obviously very lost and quite possibly in trouble.”Groves urged potential onlookers to give the whale space and minimise disturbance. In 2006, a whale died after it swum up the Thames into central London, despite efforts to rescue the animal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2378a7758a7c85bbbb248b6223a85219eb30d087/0_0_8275_5000/master/8275.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15ead466c765213f8307fef5d4dfa13c 700w","title":"no different truths last years soviet film","story":"A new season at the Barbican tells the story of the USSR’s final generation through the lens of its pioneering film-makers“Young people are our big hope, but they spell trouble for us too.” In 1965, an administrator at the Leningrad film studio, Lenfilm, summed up an enduring dilemma for Soviet official culture. How could the Young Communist League (on paper a “public organisation”, in practice entirely subordinate to the party leadership) mobilise the younger generation without promoting political enthusiasms of the wrong kind? Soviet cinema – a young art form with particular appeal to the country’s youth – was, throughout its existence, a showcase for conflicted views of young people. Its own fate, too, altered as attitudes to them changed.In the first years after the October revolution, youth activism was strongly encouraged in life and on film. Sergei Eisenstein was just 27 when Battleship Potemkin, with its martyred young leader of a naval mutiny, made him world famous. But views of political participation by children and young people changed abruptly under Stalin. Eisenstein’s Bezhin Meadow, in which a tow-haired boy leads the assault on traditional village life, ran into trouble in August 1936. This came a month after a crackdown on child psychology, which was considered “perverted”, and at the point when patriotic values were returning to the school syllabus.Soviet film studios altered, too, turning into showcases for mature artists: the masters. In the late 1940s, film production stalled – a mere eight titles for the whole USSR were produced in 1951. Almost none of the state film school, VGIK’s graduates went on to make features. They toiled away directing documentaries, public interest movies and films for schools. Most were not even allowed to shoot footage while in college. Instead, graduating students sketched proposed shots and wrote pitches for films they would never be able to make.This changed dramatically under Nikita Khrushchev. The leader’s main goal was to remobilise communist values. But the political and social reforms of the day transformed the lives of young people and gave prominence to subcultures as well as sanctioning forms of collective activity. Expansion of the film industry brought hundreds of new film artists – screenwriters, camera and sound operators, designers as well as directors – into Soviet studios.Many cinema novices were young in an approximate sense – around 40. That still made them at least 20 years younger than the surviving masters from the Stalin era. Yet, cinematic youth was in no sense overawed by the generational gulf. Some had served at the front in the second world war. A good many had lost parents to political terror. Accelerated maturity and new expectations were the texture of the times. Movies about young people became central to the thaw and shifted the cinematic language – new body types and gestures, new kinds of emotional rhetoric, and dynamic, mobile styles of camerawork – went with the youth focus.The Brezhnev era was, in Mikhail Gorbachev’s words, “the period of stagnation”. However, the new emphasis on stability gave a paradoxical prominence to youth unrest as a symptom and cause of social anomie. Social deviance was far more prominent in 1970s and early 80s cinema than during the 50s and 60s. In this sense, glasnost under Gorbachev accelerated, rather than initiated, a stark view of Soviet reality.Until recently, the films of the USSR’s last decades were mainly a specialist interest. But that is starting to change. Earlier this year, London’s Regent Street Cinema presented the season Youth on the March! in association with the Russian film foundation Kino Klassika. This gave an exhilarating introduction to nine major films by young Soviet directors from the past 50 years, including Otar Ioseliani’s Falling Leaves, Kira Muratova’s Brief Encounters and Juris Podnieks’ Is it Easy to be Young?. This week, the Barbican’s Generations: Russian Cinema of Change in collaboration with New East Cinema show six more youth films.Half the movies in the Barbican season date from the post-Stalin era, underlining its transformational importance. There is Mikhail Kalik’s luminous testament to teenage friendship, Goodbye, Boys. And there is Dinara Asanova’s harsh yet lyrical 1983 portrait of a work camp for young offenders, Tough Kids.Asanova’s movie is particularly interesting. She was, like the young people she portrayed, a marginal figure, first as a woman director (one of only three in the new generation, alongside Muratova and Larisa Shepitko, to achieve renown). Her Kyrghyz origins – only two directors permanently based in Leningrad came from central Asia – also contributed to her outsider status. She had close ties with the cultural underground and shared its intense concern with the abject and the overlooked.Asanova disliked the category of “children’s film”. “I want to show that there are no different truths for different age groups,” she wrote in her notebooks. This determination to avoid patronising young people on screen went with working methods that were, in Soviet terms, unique.All Asanova’s movies, beginning with her first full-length feature, Woodpeckers Don’t Get Headaches, were filmed using improvisation – a considerable feat in a culture where scripts went through at least seven clearance readings and ergence from agreed texts could provoke uproar. Asanova treated each shoot as a way of establishing human and intellectual contact with everyone on set. She was deeply interested in western youth films and asked the state film board, Goskino, for permission (which was refused) to show the crew If … and A Clockwork Orange during the pre-production stage of Woodpeckers.At the start of her career, Asanova faced accusations of unprofessionalism and chaotic working methods. When complete – after extensive edits – Woodpeckers was placed in the third quality category, a “soft ban” that confined screenings to film clubs and venues in distant provinces. But by the early 1980s, five films on, Asanova had convinced her colleagues of her work methods as well as her talent, which helps explain why Lenfilm took the risk of making Tough Kids to begin with. “We know this film is going to be tricky at the start, and later on, too,” said Asanova’s editor, Frizhetta Gukasyan. With “eyes open to the inevitable”, the studio’s artistic management backed the director all the way.When Tough Kids was shown to Asanova’s close colleagues, there was silence. People were so moved they couldn’t put their reactions into words. A screening at Lenfilm’s chief vetting body, the Artistic Council, though, brought indignant objections on the grounds that the film was “too soft” on young criminals. Two recent high-profile street attacks by Moscow and Leningrad teenagers, leaving victims for dead, had made s of morality nervous. Goskino insisted on edits which took 100 extra days of filming. Eventually, Tough Kids cleared the state and party approval process. In 1985 – a sign of changing times – it was awarded a state prize.By then, Asanova was dead, at the age of 42. The human cost was high, not just for her. “Cinema is the blood that I suck from other people’s lives,” she wrote in her notebooks. Some of the young people she worked with, including her son Anvar, ended up shipwrecked, caught in the gulf between Asanova’s utopian view of the creative process and the rigidity of late Soviet social norms. But Tough Kids asks questions that were too often ignored in Russia and, indeed, in any society today.Tough Kids has explicit and subversive echoes of the most famous Soviet film about young offenders, Nikolai Ekk’s 1931 classic Road Into Life, shown on TV while Asanova’s movie was in production. Yet, with its documentary-style talking heads and delicate balance between nihilism and hope, it is more post-Soviet than Soviet.The leading directors of the past 30 years, including Aleksei Balabanov, also showcased by Generations, and Andrey Zvyagintsev, have dwelt extensively on violence by and to young people. But of all film-makers, Asanova had the closest contact with young people themselves. Tough Kids was their film, as well as hers. No wonder that after it came out, Asanova got a telephone call from a young woman she had never met. “Make a follow-up to Tough Kids. Please. But this time, call it Tough Girls.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab1a01cde0b9e1f367ff1c9d5f2db37621eb2d42/0_1402_4662_2795/master/4662.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=280ef75a7117e970fd038ca53d231b25","title":"nigel slater clams pak choi and oyster sauce recipe","story":"Magnificent molluscs with juicy veg and an Oriental twistSlice 2 plump pak choi in half lengthways.

This follows growing concern that top Premier League and European clubs are stockpiling young players who are sent out on loan for long periods.Fifa said in a statement that the committee had “endorsed principles” for “new and stronger regulations for agents to be established, with agreement on the principle of introducing compensation and representation restrictions.”The Premier League’s 20 clubs spent £211m in the summer 2017 and January 2018 transfer windows and Uefa has compiled an estimate that €1.5bn was spent in total on agents across Europe in 2017. Concern has grown particularly among clubs that agents, now officially classed as “intermediaries” usually working for both a club – sometimes both clubs – and a player to broker a transfer, are being paid far too much.The case of Mino Raiola, paid £41m in total by Manchester United, Juventus and Paul Pogba when the French midfielder moved to Old Trafford in 2016 concentrated minds at Fifa and Uefa that action needed to be taken to curb the money leaving football to agents.The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, said the agreement was “a significant first step towards … developing a consensus on how to tackle the issue of agents, loans and other aspects of the transfer system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c204de9edf54f7bbd2a2bd06c5c40267ffa39b6/354_142_4083_2449/master/4083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fd8138131d29daabd43c2f596c59190","title":"the fiver i cant believe its not ballon dor","story":"Sign up now!

But is it really that easy to turn your back on jealousy? And what about all the admin?Alex Sanson is nervous. She is hosting a dinner party this Friday, and wants it to go well, because her lovers are coming – all of them. “Cooking for one person you fancy is hard enough, but three of them is even more stressful!” says Sanson, who has brown hair, an open, friendly face and a bookish air..Sanson is polyamorous, meaning that she has multiple romantic and sexual partners, all of whom are aware of the others’ existence. Currently, the 28-year-old is in a “polycule” with three other people: William, Mike and Laura, all of whom are also dating the other members of the polycule.Dinner-party jitters aside, things are going swimmingly for Sanson, who works in marketing. “There’s so much joy in being poly,” she says. “It’s lovely not to burden one person with all your stuff. You just spread it all out.”Polyamory, also known as consensual non-monogamy, seems to be growing in popularity among young people, though with no definitive figures it’s hard to know how much of this is a matter of increased visibility. It comes in many shapes and forms, from open relationships (where in layperson’s terms you “cheat” on your partner, but they are aware and do not mind, and do the same to you), to solo polyamory, where you identify as polyamorous, but are not currently in multiple relationships. But all those involved reject monogamy as stifling, or oppressive, or simply not to their taste.“It’s not as complicated as people make it sound,” Sanson insists. If you are unsure whether polyamory might suit you, try this simple thought experiment: does the thought of your partner in the first flushes of romantic ardour with another person fill you with contentment, lust, indifference, or murderous rage? If it’s the last one, best to swerve polyamory. (There’s a term for the warm feeling polyamorous people experience when seeing their partners with someone else: compersion.)“I’ve had people saying to me, ‘You just want to fuck about!’” says 29-year-old Calum James, who identifies as a heteroflexible pansexual solo polyamorous relationship anarchist. What this basically means is that James, who is mostly straight, is not currently in a polyamorous relationship with a person or persons. If he were, he would regard it as no more important than non-intimate friendships, because relationship anarchists treat romantic and non-romantic relationships the same.“I had one woman have a go at me, saying, ‘It’s an awful way to treat women,’” James says. “But people don’t understand it’s not just about meeting women and having sex with them. I want to build deep connections with people and see them regularly. I just don’t want those connections to follow the same rules as traditional relationships.”James tried monogamy, but found it “suffocating”. “I never understood monogamy, even when I was a kid. I’d think, ‘I fancy three people in my class.’”“The thing I’ve always disliked about monogamy and marriage,” Sanson adds, “is the idea of owning another person and them being your other half or somehow completing you, like you weren’t complete before you met them. What I love about polyamory is that I’m my own person and no one owns me. I don’t own any of you, either. We’re all free.”Polyamory is having a cultural moment right now, with celebrities such as Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith speaking about being non-monogamous, and the BBC drama Wanderlust depicting a middle-class couple as they open up their relationship. As anyone who lived through the 1960s, or who is from the LGBT community will tell you, polyamory is not new: free love or non-monogamy has been practised for years. But polyamory is now being adopted by people who might have been monogamous five or 10 years ago, not least because the internet makes it easier than ever for poly-curious people to educate themselves about polyamory, and connect with like-minded iniduals.“Things are changing rapidly,” says Janet Hardy, the co-author of the polyamory handbook The Ethical Slut. “More people are getting the idea that it’s possible to be happy and healthy without being monogamous. What I’m seeing among young people is that they don’t have the same need to self-define by what they like to do in bed, or in relationships, like my generation did. Everything’s out on a big buffet, and they try a little of everything.”Polyamorous people reject the end game of romantic monogamy, and disdain so-called “relationship escalators”: society’s expectation that couples will cycle through #putaringonit selfies, marriage and kids. Instead, they let their relationships flow whither the current takes them, relinquishing themselves to the whorls and eddies that change all romantic partnerships over time. In our increasingly precarious times, it makes sense that polyamory is popular. “Growing up, you’re bombarded by all this messaging about what the perfect relationship set-up is,” Sanson says. “You’re going to have a family and buy a house and do this and that. But a lot of that isn’t relevant to my generation.”Still, being polyamorous isn’t just a carefree romp. It requires you to unpick the messy yarn of human emotion, and that most familiar knot of all: jealousy. Perhaps the biggest myth of all about polyamorous people is that they don’t feel jealousy. “Jealousy is a part of human nature,” says 27-year-old William Jeffrey, a member of Sanson’s polycule. “You still feel it. But I’ve found with every jealousy I’ve ever had while being polyamorous, I’ve been able to trace the jealousy back to an insecurity about myself. When I figure out what the insecurity is, I can overcome it.”A responsible polyamorous partner accepts the other person’s jealousy. “When I started dating someone else, my partner Laura expressed that she was feeling jealous,” says Mike Scoins, 28, also in the polycule. “So I told her: ‘I acknowledge your feelings. Can we unpack the fear that is underlying your jealousy?’ In this instance, it was something along the lines of: ‘Do you still care about me?’ When you provide reassurance that, yes, absolutely, I do still care, the jealousy dissipates.”Is jealousy only ever the result of insecurity? “I’d say that’s too simplistic a view,” says Hardy. “I don’t think there’s one emotion you can call jealousy. I think jealousy is an umbrella we put over all of the emotions we find difficult that we want to quell by changing someone else’s behaviour.” In her introduction-to-polyamory workshops, Hardy asks participants to write a thank-you note to their jealousy. “It exists for a reason. Jealousy tries to protect you from something.”Can you really vanquish the green-eyed monster with introspection and communication alone? “Some people are more prone to jealousy, and some people are less prone to it,” Hardy says. “If polyamory sounds unpleasant, don’t do it! There are no merit badges here.”“I don’t really experience sexual jealousy,” Scoins muses. “My one experience of jealousy was when my then partner had two tickets for a ball and didn’t give me one.”There’s a joke about polyamory: it didn’t take off until Google Calendar was invented. The polyamorous people I interview effortlessly manage packed schedules. Jeffrey, for instance, will meet once a week to play a Buffy the Vampire Slayer role-playing game with Scoins and the fourth member of their polycule, Laura Nevo. He also has a weekly date night with his live-in partner, as well as seeing Sanson and Nevo once a week.While shows such as Wanderlust depict polyamory as a tumescent bonk-fest, in reality polyamorous people spend most of their time doing the deeply unsexy business of talking about their feelings. Sanson credits polyamory with giving her more emotional self-awareness. “Polyamory has allowed me to be more introspective, think about the motives behind what I’m doing, identify emotions more accurately and be explicit about how I’m feeling about things.”Polyamory tends to unnerve people, affronting expectations of traditional romantic monogamy. It’s harder for polyamorous people to date: apps such as Tinder or Bumble don’t have options for non-monogamous people, for instance. When James writes in his Tinder bio that he is non-monogamous, he experiences a “significant dip in matches”. And when he tells prospective romantic partners he is polyamorous, it rarely goes down well. “One date told me, ‘I was really interested in you until you told me that.’”Last New Year’s Eve, James went to a party in Sheffield, where he lives. When he walked in, heads swivelled. “They all went: ‘Is that the polyamorous one?’” James is weary of having to defend his way of life, and rightly so: consenting adults shouldn’t have to justify their sex lives to judgmental strangers. “Some people don’t recognise that what’s not right for them isn’t not right for other people,” he says. “I try to point out that it’s not harming anybody if it’s all open and honest.”And monogamous people can learn from polyamory. Twenty-three-year-old Aliyah, who uses theythem pronouns, was polyamorous, but is currently in a monogamous relationship. They credit polyamory with giving them a healthier outlook on monogamy. “The way I was taught monogamy wasn’t healthy,” Aliyah says. “I’d have this constant paranoia of being cheated on.”Polyamory made them better at monogamy. “I learned that monogamy doesn’t have to be as strict as we conceptualise it growing up,” they explain. “Before I felt that deep love should only be reserved for romantic connections. But being polyamorous taught me I have so much love for my friends, and that doesn’t have to be explored in a sexual context.”As polyamory becomes more visible, it won’t be seen as such a tear in our social fabric, but as an ordinary and unremarkable thing. This will be down to the efforts of a new generation who are normalising their freedom to live and love how they want, without nose-wrinkling or head-shaking.“My dad said to me to me the other day, ‘I’m worried about your emotional wellbeing, because you’re building relationships with these people,’” Sanson laughs. “And I was like, ‘I know! That’s the whole point.”Chiara Giovanni, 24, is in a relationship with two people. Her partner Aditya Sharad, 23, is monogamous.Chiara: I always struggled with monogamy and found it quite restrictive. Even though I was super-happy in my relationships, I wasn’t able to be monogamous and faithful. I decided to take a different tack. When I met Aditya I thought, I love this person and want to make them happy, and I need to do this differently. So I was open from the start.Ninety per cent of polyamory is talking. Sometimes I think, I want to watch a movie! I don’t want to talk about our relationship again. But it’s important to be able to express your fears, rather than waiting for the worst thing to happen.I definitely think more people would be polyamorous if they knew what polyamory was, and that it wasn’t just a phase, but valid and long-term and serious. Right now, I’m setting up a time for Aditya to meet my other partner, who is based in the US. They are both super-nervous and really want the other person to like them. It’s really cute.Aditya: At first, when a partner says, “I don’t think conventional relationship settings are working for me,” it’s hard to hear. While Chiari and I decided it would be a polyamorous relationship, I’m not a hugely social person, so it didn’t make a lot of sense for me to have multiple relationships. At the same time, I have a wonderful relationship with Chiara, who I really love. So I thought, let’s give this a try.Jealousy is never the main feeling. Something may trigger the jealousy, but it’s not a primary feeling. You’ll be feeling insecure about something, and that’s what the jealousy is about. You have to communicate about your feelings, and accept you’re not going to be given all the time and attention in your relationship.I do feel fulfilled. I wouldn’t have chosen to be poly myself, but I value Chiara. We have a joyous and uplifting relationship. So it’s not like her being polyamorous is a necessary evil. I’m just invested in what allows us to lead a life together, and what is important to her, and makes her happy.If you’d told me about polyamory eight years ago I’d have been like, “What, really, that works?” But it does. You need to be intentional about it, but it can work.Laura Nevo, 30, is part of a four-person polycule, along with William Jeffrey, Alex Sanson, and Mike Scoins.I started polyamory as an experiment. I had been in monogamous relationships all my life, and when I met my partner Mike he was honest with me. He said: “I like you, but I’m going to carry on dating other people.” I thought, fair enough. I did some research into polyamory and began to date multiple people. In previous monogamous relationships, I’d cheat on my partners and feel guilty about it. I didn’t want that to happen again.I’ve been dating Mike for two years and William for one year. I also hang out a lot with Alex, and there are other people I may have sex with. It gives me a lot of happiness to see my partners together, like William and Mike for example. It’s nice to be able to be happy for someone else, without having to be a part of their happiness.Recently, I had a challenge because one of my partners became involved with someone I really didn’t connect with. I’m trying to work through that and not bottle things up. I used to suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem, but I’ve found that polyamory helps me a lot, as I have to really figure things out.When someone new comes into our polycule, I’m extra careful of things. I think, how can we deal with this new person? How can we make them comfortable? Because it’s not nice to feel left out.Being polyamorous has felt freeing for me. It has allowed me to meet people I wouldn’t have considered as partners before. I’ve been playing more on the gender spectrum. If I were to go back to monogamy one day, I think the experience of being polyamorous would make me more accepting of people and different types of relationships.Andrea, 30, believes in ‘free and independent agency’Coming out as non-monogamous is a very slow process, because it’s so hard to bring yourself to a point where you know that the other person might terminate the relationship. Some choose to cheat, but I wanted to be open to the person I loved.When I came out as non-monogamous to my girlfriend at the time, she basically said: “I didn’t sign up for this. Why can’t I have the person I met back?” That really hurt, because I never wanted to cause her pain. But I can’t help being myself. We tried to make it work, but eventually we parted ways, because she was monogamous and I wasn’t. Everything else in the relationship worked, so that was really painful.It’s important to be open and communicate about anyone new coming into the scene. If I’m at a party and I meet someone I want to bring home, I text Anita, who I have a romantic and sexual relationship with, and let her know. And my secret tool is Google Calendar. If I’m on a date and Anita wants to hang out, she can just check my calendar for the next available slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd9fa67f97dfde718ef2922bcb1a48be7a896a9/0_1751_3744_2247/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de9472ce884e043d40034a5ed6b8b7e1","title":"yoga adriene mishler youtube interview","story":"With 4 million subscribers and hundreds of thousands more watching free weekly videos, Yoga with Adriene is a social media sensation. What makes her fans so devoted?There are more than 2,400 people in the main hall of Alexandra Palace in north London, breathing in unison. “Take the deepest breath you’ve taken all day,” says the woman at the front, “and let it out through the mouth.” Lungs empty en masse. It feels like we’re in the belly of a beast.The woman is 33-year-old yogi and actor Adriene Mishler, and this is the largest live yoga class she has ever held – she is more frequently to be found teaching alone in front of her camera at home in Austin, Texas, than IRL. And it is this intimate version of her that 4 million subscribers to her Yoga with Adriene YouTube channel have come to know and share their homes with. Her particularly popular videos – “Yoga Morning Fresh”, for instance, or “7-Minute Bedtime Yoga” – can get upwards of 2 million viewers. Search “yoga” on Google, and Adriene dominates.“You just want to be her friend,” says Magdalena Krohn, a 32-year-old teacher and performance artist who is at the Ally Pally event, queueing for a cashew curry. Karen Bradley, a 56-year-old health visitor, has travelled from Sheffield to see Adriene. Fifty-year-old civil servant Julie Ashen says she is “not that brilliant with people”, but has nevertheless travelled from Swansea to see Adriene in this setting. You must love her, I say. “I do. She’s quite a phenomenon.”When I tell friends I am meeting Adriene, they get a zealous look in their eyes: “I’m not hyperbolising when I say she changed my life,” more than one confesses – and I know they’re not, because she changed mine, too. Maybe it’s simplistic, but there is a lot to be said for being gently cajoled into focusing on the feeling of the soles of your feet on the yoga mat, when anxious thoughts have been jolting like runaway trains through your mind all day.We meet the day before the event, over an on-brand turmeric latte in an east London cafe. In real life, Adriene is as enthusiastic as her on-screen self – peppy yet sage, welcoming and warm. I mention this special alchemy that has fans talking about her as if she’s a friend. “Yeah, and we are,” she says immediately, as though she feels it too. “Whenever I meet people, I’m always like: ‘Holy shit, it’s such an honour – I get to be in people’s homes, their most vulnerable place.’” Her chat is peppered with talk of blessings and angels, but I would challenge even the most cynical-hearted not to want to get a second round of lattes in.She has a snort-out-loud sense of humour, with a confidence she attributes to a childhood raised by “creative hippies”.“Find what feels good” has been her motto ever since she started in 2012 – her followers recite it with almost evangelical fervour. This approach is part of what has drawn the numbers to her videos, and crowds to north London despite the £40 ticket price – as well as to the other stops on this European tour, which includes free classes. For Krohn, “Adriene was the first teacher who really got me to understand that yoga was about more than just physical flexibility or that kind of ego-driven thing that goes with modern yoga.” Bradley came to yoga because she has arthritis – Adriene has, she says, helped her find some acceptance: “This is where you are … you can still do things but don’t push it, find what you can do.”Practising at home has obvious advantages – people cite cheapness, struggling to get to a studio because of health issues and fitting quick sessions in around family life. Adriene’s focus is on accessibility yoga for all. You could question the altruism – as with any personality on YouTube, she earns revenue from her well-watched channel (the analytics firm Social Blade puts the brand’s annual earnings at up to £284,000). She has a sponsorship deal with Adidas, and  subscribers willing to pay $9.99 (£7.50) a month to access extra content on her Find What Feels Good site. But with millions of people able to access her yoga for free, I’ll get to critiques of her motivation once I’ve untangled from pigeon pose.Yoga is a booming industry – last year, the market was worth $80bn (£74bn) globally. Once a trailblazer, Adriene is now one of a host of online yoga teachers bringing an ancient practice to a mass, modern audience. “There are a lot of people who think it’s a little bit questionable,” she concedes. “I get why people from India are going: ‘Hey, what the hell are you doing?’” Cultural appropriation is a criticism she has seen levelled at a lot of American teachers and one that she thinks, to an extent, is fair. Has she ever been criticised herself? “I don’t actually get it that much and the only times I do, I can tell that person’s never done any of my videos. They’re lumping me in because I’m white, wearing Adidas pants.” She has, she says, “tried to teach the real traditional style yoga … I really want to honour the philosophy.”But that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been room for some online savvy. Her business partner, Chris Sharpe, who she met on the set of a horror film and who had previously produced the successful YouTube series Hilah Cooking, was aware of the need to push the videos up the search engine rankings. It made for knotty decisions. “I did not want to call anything ‘yoga for weight loss’ in the beginning,” she says. But they struck a deal and tried it: “It did so disgustingly well.”They started to play around and chose words they knew would rank highly. She cites a video called Six Pack Abs. “Is that what we abide by and are six-pack abs really possible for women? Nooooo. Anatomically, it’s just ridiculous. But I’m kind of making fun of it.” In the video, she begins in the persona of a dumbbell-bunny, before quickly caving: “Just kidding, if you know me at all I don’t really subscribe to that obsession.” If you’re not familiar with her shtick, you could be forgiven for thinking it a cynical move to get the ratings up. But she is no stranger to body-image issues herself, mentioning that before auditions, she has felt a pressure to diet.Even now, she says being “on YouTube, in tight clothing” means she has had to work hard to avoid feeling the same pressures. Instead, she says she wants to “get people closer to experiencing pure love and acceptance for themselves. She sees these video titles, antithetical to her message, as Trojan horses, bringing people to her channel so she can deliver her alternative: “You can look good all you want, but if you’re still looking in the mirror and not loving who you see, we have it backwards.” It might sound schmaltzy written down, but it is clearly a much-needed message.So why yoga, and why now? It is irresistible to link turbulent times with a practice that can help you feel grounded. I try to make it that neat: has she seen an uptick in numbers on her channels since Trump took office, say? “I don’t know how the numbers have changed in terms of big shifts in politics,” she says, “but I do know that as a woman and as a human living in this time, I feel it.” And she clearly wants her yoga to cut through. She weighs up the next words, almost egging herself on: “I want all the people who voted for Trump to do my yoga. I want all the people who battle with the experience of racism to do yoga.” There’s that yoga for all message again.Her mother is Mexican, and in recent years Adriene has been embracing her heritage more. “Not that I’ve ever tried to hide it – hell no,” she says. “But I wasn’t raised bilingual and I happen to be fair-skinned. Then I had a moment a couple of years ago when I was like: ‘Shoooot, I’m Mexican and nobody knows it.’” She is learning Spanish: “My goal is to be able to do a playlist on my channel that’s all yoga español.”Her brand’s meteoric rise has undoubtedly been helped by the boom in the global wellness industry – estimated in 2015 to be worth nearly $4tn – and Adriene knows it. “I’d be lying if I didn’t say Chris anticipated this … he had the idea of creating something in the world of wellness for a reason.”As for the recent politicisation of the wellness industry, especially in reaction to the more elitist side of it, “I just think that it’s like everything – it’s really not about what you’re putting out there, it’s about how you’re doing it. We’re saying we want everyone to feel good, and yet we’re insinuating the only way to do that is if you have enough money to buy this $65 detox tea, and then it comes in the mail and you’re like: ‘What the fuck, I could make this.’” It’s not something she’s immune to, either: “Hell yeah, I’ve Gooped.”Which is why, she says, she has started to care about the numbers – “It gives me more power to be, like, the people’s yogi.”Back in the hall of Ally Pally, we’re finishing the evening’s practice by hugging ourselves – yes, you read right. Adriene cracks a joke and then we’re all breathing in unison again, like one big, collective lung."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8752e683f22b55c42b6b8059cdf9204518f0bfab/64_0_1913_1148/master/1913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad09aeced02899812a61b0ec6d6259ac","title":"bbc two first full rebrand 25 years","story":"Channel also working with Black Mirror writer Charlie Brooker to develop new showsBBC Two is being completely rebranded for the first time in more than 25 years as the channel looks to reinvent itself in the face of threats from streaming services such as Netflix.The channel’s controller, Patrick Holland, also confirmed BBC Two was working with the Black Mirror creator, Charlie Brooker, to develop new programmes, and revealed Eva Green, Eve Hewson, and Marton Csokas would star in a big-budget adaptation of Eleanor Catton’s Booker prize-winning novel The Luminaries.Holland said traditional television channels still had enormous influence and he could offer a “curated channel in an age where you’ve got all of this choice”. But with the average age of a BBC Two viewer now in their 60s, the channel was facing up to the need to reach a younger audience, he said.The BBC is facing growing pressure from streaming services that are able to outspend it, with the director general, Tony Hall, saying the corporation needed more cash to maintain the current quality of programmes.BBC Two has already refocused its budget towards its primetime output but Holland said his channel’s ability to broadcast to millions of people on any given evening meant it could still set the tone of the national debate. “Netflix cannot do that, Amazon cannot do that. An ongoing schedule gives you an ongoing dialogue with the audience. I wouldn’t swap that for anything.”As part of the revamp, BBC Two will on Thursday drop its on-screen identity based around physical representations of the number two, which it has used in various forms since the early 90s. This will be replaced by a series of colourful visualisations based on a simple curve, which the controller said represented the channel’s “constant evolution, constant eclecticism, constant sense of quality”. It is also easier to rework and cheaper to create than the old branding.Holland said Brooker, whose Black Mirror series recently won an Emmy, was working on new projects. “He’s still working for us. There are things cooking. They haven’t finished cooking yet. They’re still in development,” he said.Other programmes heading to the channel include Riz Ahmed’s Englistan, which will tell the story of three generations of a British Pakistani family the “quite pricey” drama MotherFatherSon starring Richard Gere and a new documentary series charting the rise of Syria’s ruling Assad family.The controller said he was no longer interested in commissioning celebrity-fronted documentaries, which have clogged up schedules for years. “That sense of being told things by presenters in a traditional way is something we’ve moved on from. When you’re immersed in the story and able to make some connections yourself, it’s more grownup television and more emotionally engaging.”He also said contestants on University Challenge needed to be aware of the risk of social media abuse before going on the BBC Two quiz show. “The most important aspect of duty of care is talking through all the things that could happen and then it’s their choice whether they want to consent.”As part of the rebrand Holland is looking to work with Esme Wren, the editor of Newsnight, to “reinvigorate” the current affairs programme and make sure it fits better with the rest of the BBC Two schedule, such as by theming discussions around documentaries.“My role on BBC2 is to try and make the channel as engaged with the modern world, to make it engaged in the big questions of our time, but to do it in a way that brings extraordinary storytelling to the fore,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c49b1f4791a7522aa4fecd20ce3c29fb098c3a94/0_1181_5901_3542/master/5901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0febce25f22bf56160e58095561002b","title":"about time why western philosophy can only teach us so much","story":"By gaining greater knowledge of how others think, we can become less certain of the knowledge we think we have, which is always the first step to greater understanding. By  Julian BagginiOne of the great unexplained wonders of human history is that written philosophy first flowered entirely separately in different parts of the globe at more or less the same time. The origins of Indian, Chinese and ancient Greek philosophy, as well as Buddhism, can all be traced back to a period of roughly 300 years, beginning in the 8th century BC.These early philosophies have shaped the different ways people worship, live and think about the big questions that concern us all. Most people do not consciously articulate the philosophical assumptions they have absorbed and are often not even aware that they have any, but assumptions about the nature of self, ethics, sources of knowledge and the goals of life are deeply embedded in our cultures and frame our thinking without our being aware of them.Yet, for all the varied and rich philosophical traditions across the world, the western philosophy I have studied for more than 30 years – based entirely on canonical western texts – is presented as the universal philosophy, the ultimate inquiry into human understanding. Comparative philosophy – study in two or more philosophical traditions – is left almost entirely to people working in anthropology or cultural studies. This abdication of interest assumes that comparative philosophy might help us to understand the intellectual cultures of India, China or the Muslim world, but not the human condition.This has become something of an embarrassment for me. Until a few years ago, I knew virtually nothing about anything other than western philosophy, a tradition that stretches from the ancient Greeks to the great universities of Europe and the US. Yet, if you look at my PhD certificate or the names of the university departments where I studied, there is only one, unqualified, word: philosophy. Recently and belatedly, I have been exploring the great classical philosophies of the rest of the world, travelling across continents to encounter them first-hand. It has been the most rewarding intellectual journey of my life.My philosophical journey has convinced me that we cannot understand ourselves if we do not understand others. Getting to know others requires avoiding the twin dangers of overestimating either how much we have in common or how much ides us. Our shared humanity and the perennial problems of life mean that we can always learn from and identify with the thoughts and practices of others, no matter how alien they might at first appear. At the same time, differences in ways of thinking can be both deep and subtle. If we assume too readily that we can see things from others’ points of view, we end up seeing them from merely a variation of our own.To travel around the world’s philosophies is an opportunity to challenge the beliefs and ways of thinking we take for granted. By gaining greater knowledge of how others think, we can become less certain of the knowledge we think we have, which is always the first step to greater understanding.Take the example of time. Around the world today, time is linear, ordered into past, present and future. Our days are organised by the progression of the clock, in the short to medium term by calendars and diaries, history by timelines stretching back over millennia. All cultures have a sense of past, present and future, but for much of human history this has been underpinned by a more fundamental sense of time as cyclical. The past is also the future, the future is also the past, the beginning also the end.The dominance of linear time fits in with an eschatological worldview in which all of human history is building up to a final judgment. This is perhaps why, over time, it became the common-sense way of viewing time in the largely Christian west. When God created the world, he began a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. As Revelation puts it, while prophesying the end times, Jesus is this epic’s “Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last”.But there are other ways of thinking about time. Many schools of thought believe that the beginning and the end are and have always been the same because time is essentially cyclical. This is the most intuitively plausible way of thinking about eternity. When we imagine time as a line, we end up baffled: what happened before time began? How can a line go on without end? A circle allows us to visualise going backwards or forwards for ever, at no point coming up against an ultimate beginning or end.Thinking of time cyclically especially made sense in premodern societies, where there were few innovations across generations and people lived very similar lives to those of their grandparents, their great-grandparents and going back many generations. Without change, progress was unimaginable. Meaning could therefore only be found in embracing the cycle of life and death and playing your part in it as best you could.East Asian philosophy is deeply rooted in the cycle of the seasons, part of a larger cycle of existence. This is particularly evident in Taoism, and is vividly illustrated by the surprising cheerfulness of the 4th century BC Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when everyone thought he should have been mourning for his wife. At first, he explained, he was as miserable as anyone else. Then he thought back beyond her to the beginning of time itself: “In all the mixed-up bustle and confusion, something changed and there was qi. The qi changed and there was form. The form changed and she had life. Today there was another change and she died. It’s just like the round of four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter.”In Chinese thought, wisdom and truth are timeless, and we do not need to go forward to learn, only to hold on to what we already have. As the 19th- century Scottish sinologist James Legge put it, Confucius did not think his purpose was “to announce any new truths, or to initiate any new economy. It was to prevent what had previously been known from being lost.” Mencius, similarly, criticised the princes of his day because “they do not put into practice the ways of the ancient kings”. Mencius also says, in the penultimate chapter of the eponymous collection of his conversations, close to the book’s conclusion: “The superior man seeks simply to bring back the unchanging standard, and, that being correct, the masses are roused to virtue.” The very last chapter charts the ages between the great kings and sages.A hybrid of cyclical and linear time operates in strands of Islamic thought. “The Islamic conception of time is based essentially on the cyclic rejuvenation of human history through the appearance of various prophets,” says Seyyed Hossein Nasr, professor emeritus of Islamic studies at George Washington University. Each cycle, however, also moves humanity forward, with each revelation building on the former – the dictation of the Qur’an to Muhammad being the last, complete testimony of God – until ultimately the series of cycles ends with the appearance of the Mahdi, who rules for 40 years before the final judgment.The distinction between linear and cyclical time is therefore not always neat. The assumption of an eitheror leads many to assume that oral philosophical traditions have straightforwardly cyclical conceptions of time. The reality is more complicated. Take Indigenous Australian philosophies. There is no single Australian first people with a shared culture, but there are enough similarities across the country for some tentative generalisations to be made about ideas that are common or dominant. The late anthropologist David Maybury-Lewis suggested that time in Indigenous Australian culture is neither cyclical nor linear instead, it resembles the space-time of modern physics. Time is intimately linked to place in what he calls the “dreamtime” of “past, present, future all present in this place”.“One lives in a place more than in a time,” is how Stephen Muecke puts it in his book Ancient and Modern: Time, Culture and Indigenous Philosophy. More important than the distinction between linear or cyclical time is whether time is separated from or intimately connected to place. Take, for example, how we conceive of death. In the contemporary west, death is primarily seen as the expiration of the inidual, with the body as the locus, and the location of that body irrelevant. In contrast, Muecke says: “Many indigenous accounts of the death of an inidual are not so much about bodily death as about a return of energy to the place of emanation with which it re-identifies.”Such a way of thinking is especially alien to the modern west, where a pursuit of objectivity systematically downplays the particular, the specifically located. In a provocative and evocative sentence, Muecke says: “Let me suggest that longsightedness is a European form of philosophical myopia and that other versions of philosophy, indigenous perhaps, have a more lived-in and intimate association with societies of people and the way they talk about themselves.”Muecke cites the Australian academic Tony Swain’s view that the concept of linear time is a kind of fall from place. “I’ve got a hunch that modern physics separated out those dimensions and worked on them, and so we produced time as we know it through a whole lot of experimental and theoretical activities,” Muecke told me. “If you’re not conceptually and experimentally separating those dimensions, then they would tend to flow together.” His indigenous friends talk less of time or place independently, but more of located events. The key temporal question is not “When did this happen?” but “How is this related to other events?”That word related is important. Time and space have become theoretical abstractions in modern physics, but in human culture they are concrete realities. Nothing exists purely as a point on a map or a moment in time: everything stands in relation to everything else. So to understand time and space in oral philosophical traditions, we have to see them less as abstract concepts in metaphysical theories and more as living conceptions, part and parcel of a broader way of understanding the world, one that is rooted in relatedness. Hirini Kaa, a lecturer at the University of Auckland, says that “the key underpinning of Maori thought is kinship, the connectedness between humanity, between one another, between the natural environment”. He sees this as a form of spirituality. “The ocean wasn’t just water, it wasn’t something for us to be afraid of or to utilise as a commodity, but became an ancestor deity, Tangaroa. Every living thing has a life force.”This should be clear enough. But the tradition of western philosophy, in particular, has striven for a universality that glosses over differences of time and place. The word “university”, for example, even shares the same etymological root as “universal”. In such institutions, “the pursuit of truth recognises no national boundaries”, as one commentator observed. Place is so unimportant in western philosophy that, when I discovered it was the theme of the quinquennial East-West Philosophers’ Conference in 2016, I wondered if there was anything I could bring to the party at all. (I decided that the absence of place in western philosophy itself merited consideration.)The universalist thrust has many merits. The refusal to accept any and every practice as a legitimate custom has bred a very good form of intolerance for the barbaric and unjust traditional practices of the west itself. Without this intolerance, we would still have slavery, torture, fewer rights for women and homosexuals, feudal lords and unelected parliaments. The universalist aspiration has, at its best, helped the west to transcend its own prejudices. At the same time, it has also legitimised some prejudices by confusing them with universal truths. The philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah argues that the complaints of anti-universalists are not generally about universalism at all, but pseudo-universalism, “Eurocentric hegemony posing as universalism”. When this happens, intolerance for the indefensible becomes intolerance for anything that is different. The aspiration for the universal becomes a crude insistence on the uniform. Sensitivity is lost to the very different needs of different cultures at different times and places.This “posing as universalism” is widespread and often implicit, with western concepts being taken as universal but Indian ones remaining Indian, Chinese remaining Chinese, and so on. To end this pretence, Jay L Garfield and Bryan W Van Norden propose that those departments of philosophy that refuse to teach anything from non-western traditions at least have the decency to call themselves departments of western philosophy.The “pattern thinking” of Maori and Indigenous Australian philosophies could provide a corrective to the assumption that our values are the universal ones and that others are aberrations. It makes credible and comprehensible the idea that philosophy is never placeless and that thinking that is uprooted from any land soon withers and dies.Mistrust of the universalist aspiration, however, can go too far. At the very least, there is a contradiction in saying there are no universal truths, since that is itself a universal claim about the nature of truth. The right view probably lies somewhere between the claims of naive universalists and those of defiant localists. There seems to be a sense in which even the universalist aspiration has to be rooted in something more particular. TS Eliot is supposed to have said: “Although it is only too easy for a writer to be local without being universal, I doubt whether a poet or novelist can be universal without being local, too.” To be purely universal is to inhabit an abstract universe too detached from the real world. But just as a novelist can touch on universals of the human condition through the particulars of a couple of characters and a specific story, so our different, regional philosophical traditions can shed light on more universal philosophical truths even though they approach them from their own specific angles.We should not be afraid to ground ourselves in our own traditions, but we should not be bound by them. Gandhi put this poetically when he wrote: “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any. I refuse to live in other people’s houses as an interloper, a beggar or a slave.”In the west, the predominance of linear time is associated with the idea of progress that reached its apotheosis in the Enlightenment. Before this, argues the philosopher Anthony Kenny, “people looking for ideals had looked backwards in time, whether to the primitive church, or to classical antiquity, or to some mythical prelapsarian era. It was a key doctrine of the Enlightenment that the human race, so far from falling from some earlier eminence, was moving forward to a happier future.”Kenny is expressing a popular view, but many see the roots of belief in progress deeper in the Christian eschatological religious worldview. “Belief in progress is a relic of the Christian view of history as a universal narrative,” claims John Gray. Secular thinkers, he says, “reject the idea of providence, but they continue to think humankind is moving towards a universal goal”, even though “the idea of progress in history is a myth created by the need for meaning”.Whether faith in progress is an invention or an adaptation of the Enlightenment, the image of secular humanists naively believing humanity is on an irreversible, linear path of advancement seems to me a caricature of their more modest hope, based in history, that progress has occurred and that more is possible. As the historian Jonathan Israel says, Enlightenment ideas of progress “were usually tempered by a strong streak of pessimism, a sense of the dangers and challenges to which the human condition is subject”. He dismisses the idea that “Enlightenment thinkers nurtured a naive belief in man’s perfectibility” as a “complete myth conjured up by early 20th-century scholars unsympathetic to its claims”.Nevertheless, Gray is right to point out that linear progress is a kind of default way of thinking about history in the modern west and that this risks blinding us to the ways in which gains can be lost, advances reversed. It also fosters a sense of the superiority of the present age over earlier, supposedly less “advanced” times. Finally, it occludes the extent to which history doesn’t repeat itself but does rhyme.The different ways in which philosophical traditions have conceived time turn out to be far from mere metaphysical curiosities. They shape the way we think about both our temporal place in history and our relation to the physical places in which we live. It provides one of the easiest and clearest examples of how borrowing another way of thinking can bring a fresh perspective to our world. Sometimes, simply by changing the frame, the whole picture can look very different.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.This is an edited extract from How the World Thinks: A Global History of Philosophy, published by Granta on 4 October.

I think a bad deal will be a deal, for example, that broke up the United Kingdom. We want to maintain the unity of the United Kingdom.“What we’ve put on the table is a good deal. It’s a deal that retains the unity of the United Kingdom, our constitutional integrity. It’s a deal which provides for no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, protects jobs and enables us to have a good trade relationship with Europe and good trade relationships with the rest of the world.”At an informal EU summit in Salzburg last week, May had hoped to receive supportive words for her Chequers plan before what is expected to be a bruising Conservative party conference starting on Sunday. Instead, the prime minister was told that Brussels still had significant and fundamental problems with the plan.Asked whether she continued to face the impasse outlined in her robust statement at Downing Street the day after the summit, May said subsequent words from Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, had showed signs of progress.“I think what he has clarified is that there is hope and expectation for a deal on the side of the European Union, and of course there are aspects of the Chequers proposal which they’re comfortable with,” she said.There was, however, more to be done, May said: “I believe it would work not just for us but for the EU. But if they have concerns they need to detail those concerns to us, and if they have counter-proposals let’s hear the counter-proposals, and then we can discuss those and take it forward.”Asked about Labour’s ideas for Brexit that emerged from its conference this week, May condemned the expectation that the party’s MPs will vote against her final deal.“From the Labour party’s point of view they will oppose any deal I bring back, regardless of how good it is for the UK, and they will accept any deal Europe gives, regardless of how bad it is for the UK,” she said. “That’s not in the national interest. What we’re doing is in the national interest.”May, who arrived in New York on Tuesday lunchtime local time, was scheduled to meet the presidents of Iran, Turkey and France – Hassan Rouhani, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Emmanuel Macron – and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.On Wednesday May will meet Trump, address the general assembly, and discuss Brexit and trade with business leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac2d97c5b655ccf7481e7a4b615d9fbe832b4bcb/0_175_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e6be7e5433ae235e848c43a186859b","title":"tuesday at the labour party conference","story":"A row over Brexit and a passionate speech by Emily Thornberry were among the highlights of the dayTosh McDonald, Aslef president, on Margaret Thatcher: “I hated her. I wish I could be like Jeremy and rise above it but I can’t ... I did set my alarm clock an hour earlier than I needed just so I could hate her for an hour longer.”Brexit. Steve Turner, an assistant general secretary of Unite, stepped on to the podium in the morning to slap down shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer over the party’s second referendum policy. Starmer had wowed delegates when he declared to the hall, “Nobody is ruling out remain as an option” – prompting the party’s most powerful union to hit back.There was not so much applause for Turner, when he spoke an hour later, but there was no mistaking his intent. If Labour were to organise a second referendum “despite what Keir Starmer may have said”, it would be “a public vote, that’s a vote on terms of our departure”. That meant that the choice put before the electorate would be to endorse the deal negotiated by the government of the day – or no deal at all.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, made a passionate and wide-ranging speech which was well-received on the conference floor and interpreted by some as a leadership pitch.The MP pointedly compared antisemites within Labour to fascists, and said the party had to act now: “If we want to root out fascism and racism and hatred from our world, and from our country, then we must start, we must start, with rooting it out of our own party.”Continuing the focus on the fight against fascism in the UK, Thornberry also highlighted Labour’s long history fighting the far right, arguing that there was no need to resurrect the Anti-Nazi League because Labour effectively was the anti-Nazi League.On foreign affairs, Thornberry promised that, under Corbyn, the UK would “lead the world in promoting human rights, in reforming the arms trade, in pursuing an end to conflict, in supporting, not demonising, refugees, and in turning the promise of a nuclear-free world from an impossible dream to a concrete goal”.A plan to create a second deputy leader position for a woman was unexpectedly shelved when the constituency party that had submitted the rule change, Wirral West, suddenly dropped the motion, almost certainly at the suggestion of the party’s leadership. A former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown speculated as to why:Jeremy Corbyn’s speech at noon. Gone are the days when the leader’s speech was on Tuesday afternoon in the middle of a week-long conference, meaning that the rest of the week was something of an anti-climax. Now it is the final event: the early signs are that the Labour leader will seek to shift the agenda to the party’s offer to the country after a dismal summer in which the row about antisemitism dominated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1b97d55196a6e31a57fbcb850d69df7dabf656/0_137_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f59d3b241dcfa88e5393839acad3923","title":"labour conference brexit debate starmer increasingly likely to vote down mays brexit deal starmer says politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the Labour conference in Liverpool, including the debate on Brexit and a second referendumThat’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has just finished her speech to conference. Here are the key points.We know that in this country you generally need a warrant to enter someone’s home or intercept their telephone calls. So we will insist on time limited, judicial warrants for any undercover policing.We know who suffers from crime the most: it’s the most vulnerable women the elderly children all of our ethnic minority communities the LGBTQ community and disabled people.So, it is has always been wrong to say ‘law and order’ is somehow a Tory issue. Fighting crime and upholding the law are key issues for our communities and therefore they are key issues for Labour.The government refuses to accept that their cuts to fire services are responsible for longer response times. They refuse to accept that privatisation and deregulation, led inevitably to disasters like Grenfell. More than a year later they have not produced a single initiative that would prevent a repeat of Grenfell. The government is failing to protect communities and ensure their safety.The Brexit composite motion has been passed overwhelmingly on a show of hands. Only a handful of people voted against.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has said Labour needs to be “a little more relaxed” about all women-shortlists being hijacked by trans candidates, lamenting the fact that the debate about gender-identity is so “aggressive”.At a fringe event with The Times’s Matt Chorley she said the feminist movement was “big enough” to include transgender candidates who were born men but believe they are women. She said:I found the trans debate quite challenging, but talking to people, and listening to people when they are not shouting, what really struck me, what I have learned from feminism, is there are people who are marginalised and people who are treated badly. The feminism movement is big enough, and if someone believes they are born a man but are a woman, we have space.Sometimes people say ‘What about women’s shortlists?’ There’s going to be a whole load of men turning up in dresses.Really? You know, leaders have a good sense of their local parties, they will decide who they are going to have on their shortlist and they will have a good idea of people who are genuinely struggling with their identity and people who can contribute to parliament and be a good representative. I think we need to be a little more relaxed about it and I think it’s desperately sad to see the way in which it’s become so aggressive. We need to step down a little bit.Jeremy Corbyn has been giving a series of interviews to broadcasters today. The Press Association’s Andrew Woodcock was sitting in, and he has filed the best quotes, embargoed until 5pm. Here they are.Well we don’t know what the question is going to be in the referendum so that is a hypothetical question. I can’t answer that question because we don’t know what the question is going to be.When Channel 4 News asked if he would rule out voting remain, he replied:We will decide what our position is. I am the leader of the party and I will respect the decision of the party.Those are the words of the motion that was supported by the National Executive and the shadow cabinet and that is what is being voted on in conference. I think it’s going to be carried by a very large majority.Keir put that in because it’s what’s there in the motion. Corbyn said Starmer’s speech was cleared in advance by his office. Asked if that included the ad libbed line about remain being an option, Corbyn said: “The speech was cleared.”At the moment it looks like it, and we will challenge this government with the six tests. If they don’t meet them, then we will vote against them.Asked if article 50 would have to be extended, he replied:That is not in our hands. Article 50 can only be extended by the agreement of the entirety of the European Union.Earlier Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said clearly that if Labour won an early general election, it would seek to extend article 50. (See 3.14pm.)I took part in some programmes with Press TV. ... I severed my connection because of the way they treated the opposition parties.Every programme I spoke on, I talked about human rights.I haven’t noticed it if they are. It’s not something that keeps me awake at night, in fact nothing keeps me awake at night.I’m very healthy, very fit, very proud to lead our party. I will carry on doing exactly that because I want to bring about a social transformation and give real hope to young people and those who are up against it in our society.Asked when he would feel the job was done, he replied: “When we’ve achieved it.”In the Welsh assembly today, in response to a question from the Plaid Cymru AM Steffan Lewis, the Labour first minister Carwyn Jones explained the difficulties with holding a referendum if Theresa May does secure a Brexit deal. Asked if he thought the referendum should include an option to remain in the EU, he replied:I think that’s likely. I think that there are two possibilities here, are there not? If there’s no deal, then it would be ‘no deal’ or remain. If there is a deal, it becomes a bit more complicated, in the sense that it’s: ‘Do you accept the deal? But, if you don’t, what do you want: “no deal” or remain?’ There are ways in which the Electoral Commission, I’m sure, can finesse that referendum. But, if there’s no deal on the table, well, surely people have the right to express a view as to whether they wish to leave in circumstances that not one Brexiteer suggested would happen. Nobody said two years ago, ‘If there’s no deal, it doesn’t matter.’ No-one said it. Everyone said, ‘There will be a deal.’ That’s changed.This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about Emily Thornberry’s speech. It is getting rave reviews.From the Daily Mirror’s Kevin MaguireFrom the Independent’s Tom PeckFrom the New Statsman’s Patrick MaguireFrom the ’s Pippa CrerarFrom the Daily Record’s Torcuil CrichtonFrom the Daily ’s Steven SwinfordFrom the BBC’s James LandaleFrom the Times’ Patrick KiddIn the conference Maddy Kirkman, a delegate from Edinburgh Central, is now speaking on Brexit. She says trade unionists know that, if you strike a deal, you should put it to your members. And they would never bring forward a deal worse than the status quo, she says. She backs the motion.Here is some video of Emily Thornberry’s speech.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, finished her speech to the conference a few minutes ago. It was a big picture speech, packed with history and sweeping declarations about human rights, and Thornberry delivered it with shouty passion which sounded a bit forced but which seemed to go down well with the audience. Here are the highlights.Conference, let me speak to you from the depths of my heart and my soul and say something I never thought I’d have to say in my lifetime as a Labour member and activist, and it is simply this: that if we want to root out fascism and racism and hatred from our world, and from our country, then we must start, we must start, with rooting it out of our own party.We all support the Palestinian cause, we are all committed to recognise the Palestinian state, and I stand here with no hesitation when I condemn the Netanyahu government for its racist policies and its criminal actions against the Palestinian people. But I know as well, and we must all acknowledge, that there are sickening iniduals on the fringes of our movement, who use our legitimate support for Palestine as a cloak and a cover for their despicable hatred of Jewish people, and their desire to see Israel destroyed. Those people stand for everything that we have always stood against and they must be kicked out of our party the same way Oswald Mosley was kicked out of Liverpool.We were there in Spain fighting Franco in 1936. We were there in Cable Street that same year fighting alongside the Jewish community to stop the Blackshirts. We were here in Liverpool a year later, when Oswald Mosley tried to speak in this great city and was forced out without saying a word. And we were there in the 1980s - I was there myself - when we marched against the National Front.And let’s remember Conference, we won all those battles! We beat the Blackshirts, and the NF, and the BNP, and the EDL, and whatever they call themselves today, however they dress up their racial hatred, we are there in the same streets telling the fascists: ‘No Pasaran’.And when we look back on all those battles, stretching back 80 years, I make a simple point, it hasn’t been thousands of Tories assembling in the streets to fight the forces of fascism. It’s been the men and women in this room. It’s been Jack Jones and Jeremy’s parents. It’s been Jon Lansman and Len McCluskey, Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. So while I make a point of never disagreeing with John on anything, I disagree with him on this: we don’t need a new Anti-Nazi League, because the Anti-Nazi League is in this hall and on this stage.That was a reference to John McDonnell’s call for a new Anti-Nazi League.  Thornberry’s line worked very well in the hall, and received a strong round of applause, although describing Labour as the Anti-Nazi League is potentially risky the Anti-Nazi League was seen as a front organisation for the far-left SWP.Because if we truly want to realise the dream of The Internationale to unite the human race, and re-unite our country, then again we must start with uniting our own party, and ending the pointless conflicts which ide our movement, which poison our online debate, and which distract us from fighting the Tories.Because as Gandhi said: “We but mirror the world so if we could change ourselves, the world would also change.” But if we can’t show the strength to change ourselves to change the way we behave to each other, how can we ever hope to change the country, and aspire to change the world?It is also – far more dangerously – the rise of leaders projecting a form of nationalism not defined by love of one’s country and one’s people, but by hatred towards everyone else by the erosion of democracy and free speech and by the demonisation of any minority, any religion, and indeed any media outlet deemed to be ‘the enemy’ ...That is why our world leaders shrug their shoulders as the climate Ccange crisis reaches the point of no return. That is why governments like ours continue to sell arms to Saudi Arabia even when it is proven that those weapons are being used to murder innocent children in Yemen. That is why the war in Syria too remains so intractable and destructive, with the dozen major countries involved not striving to stop it, but playing their own lethal power games with other peoples’ lives. That is why North Korea can happily continue developing their bomb Iran can keep Nazanin jailed for a third year Myanmar and Cameroon can slaughter their own citizens at will Russia can act with impunity not just in Syria but in Salisbury and Donald Trump can tear up treaties it took other leaders years to agree. All because Conference, the world order has been turned into a global free-for-all, and the leadership to fix it is simply not there. But Conference, it’s here in this hall, it’s here on this stage, it’s here in Jeremy Corbyn. And we as the Labour Party in government must strive to lead the world in a different direction.As I mentioned earlier, Sir Keir Starmer’s declaration that Labour would not vote for a “vague” Brexit deal shows how difficult it will be for May to get any deal she secures in the autumn through parliament.On the World at One the Tory MP Mark Francois also increased the pressure on May by saying the European Research Group, which represents around 50 Conservative MPs backing a harder Brexit, would refuse to vote for a Brexit deal based on the Chequers plan. He said:We’ve yet to know what the final deal looks like, but if it is based on Chequers then myself and my colleagues in the ERG cannot vote for Chequers because we believe it doesn’t represent Brexit. We would like the prime minister to change tack and to move towards a more Canada-style free trade agreement, we think that has many, many advantages for the UK. But if push really comes to shove and they try to put Chequers through the House of Commons then I and my colleagues will vote against it. An ERG source said that Francois was making an official statement on behalf of the group, not freelancing.Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the Labour party will seek to extend article 50 to give it the time to negotiate a better Brexit deal for Britain. At a fringe event with the Times’s Red Box editor Matt Chorley, she promised it would be part of the new Brexit manifesto. She said:We should have a general election and on our manifesto we should say ‘we will abide by the results of the referendum’, we cannot obviously leave in current circumstances, we need to extend article 50 - to pre-empt your next question I don’t know how long it will take - but we need to extend article 50 and essentially turn up in Europe and say the ‘grown ups have turned up now, let’s sit down and talk.Article 50 can only be extended by the unanimous agreement of the 27 other member states, and on the request of the withdrawing state, which May has already said she is not prepared to do.Colin Monehen, a delegate from Harlow, has just finished a speech moving the contemporary composite on Palestine. It was very powerful stuff - one of the most emotional speeches of the day - and it started with Monehen asking delegates to imagine two babies born in Jerusalem, one Israeli and one Palestinian, and he went on to describe the plight of thousands of Palestinians forced out of their homes when Israel was created in 1948. He said the UK could not ignore the need to put right this injustice because it was involved in what happened. Towards the end of his speech the conference chair told him his time was up. Monehen said they would have to send an army to get him off the stage because he was speaking for the Palestinians, and he was allowed to finish.Some delegates are waving Palestinian flags. That prompted another delegate to stand up complaining about double standards in the morning, he said, some people wanted to wave EU flags, but the stewards would not allow it, he said.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told a fringe meeting at lunchtime that article 50 should be extended (ie, that Brexit should be postponed beyond 29 March 2019), my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports.The afternoon session of the conference has just started. Delegates are debating two contemporary motions, on justice for the Windrush generation, and on Palestine.Lord Dubs, the Labour peer behind the “Dubs amendment” saying the UK should take in 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees, is speaking now. He says when he first proposed the amendment, Theresa May, the then home secretary, called him in and asked him to withdraw it. She was worried that it would lead to more child migrants coming, he says. He says he ignored her. Subsequently public opinion shifted, and the government said it would back the amendment. But ministers have not honoured it in word or in spirit, he says.Here is a picture of Jeremy Corbyn embracing David Mallon, the delegate who said he was he was opposed to a referendum and who described the EU as a “capitalists’ club”, after his speech. See 12.45pm. A colleague who witnessed it said that Mallon was lingering on the stage afterwards, as if holding out for some sort of acknowledgement from Corbyn, and that you should not read too much into Corbyn’s decision to hug him.If the Tory benches aren’t brave enough to do that, to stand up to the Johnsons and Moggs - if they fail us, we demand they go back to the people with a vote on the deal.That is not in a second referendum, despite what Keir Starmer may have said earlier, it will be a public vote, that’s a vote on the terms of our departure.And this is from the former Labour Number 10 adviser Theo Bertram.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was the final speaker in the conference hall this morning. She had two announcements to make.Thriving high streets were once the centre of communities, somewhere local people were proud of but once flourishing businesses are now replaced by boarded-up shops with almost 25,000 vacant retail and leisure premises across Great Britain. Household names such as Toys R Us and Maplin have disappeared and big brands like New Look and M\u0026ampS are closing stores across the country.The move to online retail and the changing nature of the way we shop doesn’t need to mean empty high streets and job losses. It can mean a vibrant community space, with local independent shops, cafes and restaurants.But that will require governmental action to reinvigorate our high streets ..Today I am announcing Labour’s emergency 5-point plan to save Britain’s high streets.The next Labour government will ban ATM charges and stop Post Office and bank branch closures.We will provide free bus travel for under 25s.Deliver free public Wi-Fi in town centres.Establish a register of landlords of empty shops in each local authority.And finally, on one of the most pressing issues, business rates we will introduce annual revaluations of rates, exempt new plant and machinery from revaluations, ensure a fair appeals system and fundamentally review the business rates system to bring it into the 21st century.Long-Bailey stressed that these were measures that could be introduced immediately. The party was also working on long-term measures to address the problem, she said. The truth is the Tories are off track to meet our current targets.We acknowledge that the UK needs to do much more to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C. So today I state firmly that a Labour government will back a target for net zero emissions by 2050.My colleague Adam Vaughan has more on this here.My colleague Martin Kettle has written a good column about the Keir Starmer speech. Here is an extract.“Nobody,” said Starmer, “is ruling out remain as an option.” The response in the hall to that was immediate. First an instant volley of applause, but then, from deeper in the hall, and somehow also from somewhere deeper in the gut of the party conference, came the cheering, prolonged and surging, and then the standing ovation.It was a powerful moment. As someone who has been reporting party conferences for a very long time, I can’t remember all that many like it in any party. It’s rare for a politician, even addressing their supporters, to hit the spot with something truly unexpected and powerful. But Starmer’s embrace of the possibility of remaining in the EU hit that spot unerringly. It was, it seems, an improvised addition to the speech. The words weren’t in the planned text. But the words mattered – and so did the response in the hall. Most were on the feet. The applause went on and on. This was, it suddenly felt, a Labour party that really is up for a fight to preserve Britain’s place in Europe.And here is the full article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115834500f5097e8b65a58c7bbe16345958c0e92/0_90_3583_2149/master/3583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f227f770a881887c02e7e0eafed5123","title":"annemiek van vleuten world time trial cycling","story":"Annemiek van Vleuten pipped her compatriot Anna van der Breggen as the Dutch dominated the women’s time-trial at the World Road Race Championships in Innsbruck.Van Vleuten claimed victory by 28 seconds over the reigning Olympic road race champion, with Ellen van Dijk completing the all-orange podium in third.Van Vleuten completed the 27.8km course in 34min 25sec to regain the title in impressive fashion and continue her dominant end to the current season.The British pair Alice Barnes and Hayley Simmonds finished more than three-and-a-half minutes behind the winner in 22nd and 23rd places, respectively.Van Vleuten, who was lucky to escape serious injury after a horror crash during the Olympics, will now focus her attention on Saturday’s road race."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dbc49daf2c3b536fddaa4b12fd49c468ffb688b/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d73a608ceba3c00ba5a60accf7ccf09b","title":"rfu perplexed agustin pichot reform rugby calendar","story":"The Rugby Football Union is “perplexed” at moves from World Rugby’s vice-chairman, Agustín Pichot, to drastically reform the international calendar by introducing a World League from 2020 onwards.Pichot’s proposal – which would see the world’s top 12 teams compete in an annual tournament rotated between hemispheres every November – is set to be discussed as the World Rugby council meets in Sydney throughout this week.The RFU would oppose the idea on the basis that the autumn international series is a huge source of revenue – it is estimated each match at Twickenham generates up to £10m. But the union is also frustrated because international windows in July and November from 2020 onwards were the cornerstone of an agreement reached by World Rugby in San Francisco last January. Along with Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Players’ Association, the RFU is close to announcing how the domestic season in England fits into the global calendar as agreed in San Francisco.An RFU spokeswoman told the : “We are a bit perplexed at these apparent developments and ideas which we have not been party to. We have worked really hard with our stakeholders PRL and RPA to define the new domestic season and we are working to the principles agreed with World Rugby which we have been assured are still valid.”It is understood the RFU lodged a complaint with World Rugby over Pichot’s comments and received assurances from the global governing body’s chairman Bill Beaumont. Since then however, details of Pichot’s plans – as well as reported meetings with executives from the New Zealand, South Africa and French unions – have emerged.The RFU expects discussions on the global calendar in Sydney to centre on how commercial revenues from the international game can be increased based on the San Francisco agreement. But privately there is a degree of concern Pichot is gathering support from other unions behind the scenes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42aaef74458710d290b7d58ce52e22d54182fafd/158_240_4762_2856/master/4762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04886c28a83c6280ec97a58e387cf069","title":"tiger woods guantlet younger generation ryder cup","story":"Tiger Woods has warned golf’s new generation to be careful what they wish for, telling them that if they have always wanted to play him when he is on form, then now is the time.The 42-year-old saw off an illustrious field to win the Tour Championship in Atlanta on Sunday. It was his first victory since 2013 – and his 80th PGA Tour title in total – and completed a stunning return from a fourth back operation. As he now turns his focus to the Ryder Cup, the world No 13 says he is relishing playing against – and with – golfers who have never experienced him in his prime.“The younger guys were on their way in when I was on my way out,” he said. “They had never really played against me when I was playing well. It’s been five years since I’ve won a golf tournament.Thomas, Spieth, DeChambeau and Koepka at least have Woods as a teammate in this week’s Ryder Cup. McIlroy and Rose are prominent members of the opposition.Further proof that the Woods swagger is back came in a strange Tuesday moment when a member of the media thanked the 14-times major winner for delivering another victory. Woods could not resist a dig in his reply. “There have been a lot of you who have supported me through a lot of the years, and many have doubted that I’d play golf again, and win again,” Woods said. “So I want to say thank you to all the people that have supported me.”The scale of Woods’s East Lake win, which has been felt across sport, has not yet resonated with the man himself. Woods joined the USA team who flew overnight to Paris on Sunday into Monday, and has instantly reacquainted himself with Ryder Cup matters.“I’ve been trying to answer the text messages I’ve gotten but I’m still well north of 150,” Woods said. “I haven’t really had a lot of time to soak it in. I will, post-Ryder Cup. I’ll take a look back and reflect on it. I saw a couple of videos on some French news channel but I haven’t sat down and watched it yet. I still have this event to do.“Post-Ryder Cup, it will be a different story. I will look back and soak it up and really reflect on what transpired that entire week.”Woods’s focus on the biennial event is understandable. He has been involved in only one USA victory in seven previous playing appearances, and that was as long ago as Brookline 1999. The Americans have not won in Europe since 1993.“We haven’t done well,” Woods conceded. “The year that we won in 2008 I had reconstruction knee surgery after the US Open and I didn’t play. And I was a vice-captain in 2016, but it’s different being a player.“My overall Ryder Cup record, not having won as a player since 1999, is something that hopefully we can change. We haven’t won as a US squad here in 25 years on foreign soil, so hopefully that will change this week, as well.“ There’s a lot of nerves. It’s excitement. It’s a different atmosphere and one that we absolutely love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65afed543ee5c28b24f0a2e636c45b82011cf14d/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98ac9b619ad3c42fe9873f95969d0ac4","title":"brett kavanaugh second accuser testimony","story":"President claims Deborah Ramirez was drunk when alleged incident took place and assails Democrats for playing a ‘con game’Donald Trump has attacked one of two women to accuse Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, saying she “has nothing” on his supreme court nominee and was “messed up” and drunk when the alleged incident took place, as he accused Democrats of running a “con game” to block Kavanaugh’s confirmation.Trump, seated next to the Colombian president at the United Nations in New York, cast doubt on allegations brought by Deborah Ramirez, who alleged that she was harassed by Kavanaugh when they were both at Yale.“The second accuser has nothing,” Trump said. “The second accuser thinks maybe it could have been him, maybe not. She admits she was drunk. She admits time lapses.”“She was totally inebriated and all messed up and she doesn’t know,” he continued, adding sarcastically: “Gee, let’s not make him a supreme court judge.”His comments came after the White House said on Tuesday it was open to hearing public testimony from another woman who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault.With his nomination hanging in the balance, Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the initial accuser who alleged that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers in high school, are scheduled to appear before a Senate panel at a public hearing in Washington on Thursday morning.Republicans have hired an as-yet unnamed female attorney to handle questioning during the hearing, with Democrats saying the move was inconsistent with the GOP pledge to avoid a “circus”.In an interview on Tuesday morning, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was asked if the panel, the Senate judiciary committee, should hear from Ramirez.In an interview with the New Yorker published on Sunday, Ramirez said Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her at a party in the early 1980s.“Certainly we would be open to that, and that process could take place on Thursday,” Sanders said during an appearance on ABC’s Good Morning America. “The president has been clear, let them speak.”Senate Republicans have increasingly hardened their defense of Kavanaugh even as they sought to assure Ford that she would receive “fair and respectful” treatment when she testifies on Thursday.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on the Senate floor on Tuesday that “vague, unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations of 30-plus-year-old misconduct” were “nowhere near grounds to nullify someone’s career or destroy their good name”. He also attacked Democrats, accusing them of “malpractice” for waiting until the final stage of the confirmation process to bring the allegation to light.Speaking after him on the floor, the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said McConnell should “apologize immediately” to Ford for calling her allegations against the judge part of a “smear” job led by Democrats. He said it was “galling” for McConnell to blame Democrats for playing partisan games with the accusations when he has done “more than maybe anyone to politicize the supreme court nomination process”.“Don’t they want the truth?” Schumer asked of Republicans. When asked on Tuesday if there should be a full FBI investigation about the claims, the Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, seen as a key swing vote, told reporters: “Well, it would sure clear up all the questions, wouldn’t it?”But Kavanaugh’s fate rests with a handful of Republican senators: Murkowski, Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate.Collins and Murkowski, who are not on the Senate committee, told reporters on Monday that they would wait for the hearing to make up their mind. Flake, who is retiring, was among the first to call for delaying a committee vote to hear from Ford. On Monday evening, Trump tweeted: “The Democrats are working hard to destroy a wonderful man, and a man who has the potential to be one of our greatest Supreme Court Justices ever, with an array of False Accusations the likes of which have never been seen before!”Ford has alleged that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party more than three decades ago, when he was 17 and she was 15, saying he put his hand over her mouth to stop her screaming as he attempted rape. A third woman is expected to step forward with new allegations this week.Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegation against him and on Monday night took the extremely unusual step of appearing in a TV interview while the Senate considers his nomination.“I had never sexually assaulted anyone, not in high school, not ever,” Kavanaugh said in an interview with Fox News."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd621dcb8a44c84b1397b01fba0c5ee5c271a02f/0_226_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a8b5d7f9bb47c4d20f3189b801f3773","title":"england has more than 200000 empty homes how to revive them","story":"New schemes are taking derelict homes and resurrecting them. Some even create apprenticeships for young people in the processAsk most people about England’s epidemic of empty homes and they are likely to think of lavish vacant mansions in London owned by absent foreign billionaires.In fact, the majority of empty properties are in post-industrial areas, where poverty rates are high and house prices languish well below their pre-crash levels. Such a place is Stockton-on-Tees, near Middlesbrough, where Martyn Jones lives.Two years ago Jones, 23, was homeless and relying on friends to let him sleep on their couches while he struggled to find work. Today, he is painting a wall in a gutted home on a quiet street, part of a group tasked with refurbishing some of the area’s many vacant, derelict homes.Last week, Theresa May pledged an extra £2bn for housing associations to fund large-scale developments. But with new house building not providing enough affordable homes for more than 1 million people on waiting lists in England, social enterprises and councils are trying to bring empty homes, which number well over 200,000 and are worth almost £50bn, back into occupancy.One of them is Community Campus 87, which buys such properties in Stockton-on-Tees, refurbishes them and offers them to previously homeless tenants at rents below the going rate for social housing. In the process, it provides jobs and skills training for people such as Jones.Having left school at 16, Jones struggled with substance use and anxiety, unable to hold down a job. When his mother kicked him out, he worried he was out of options. “I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for Campus,” he says. “They gave me a home, helped me along the way and now I’ve started going to college.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAt the opposite end of the country, Plymouth city council is offering landlords loans and grants of up to £50,000 per property to bring 375 long-term vacant properties back into use in the next three years. Fifty-nine homes were brought back into occupancy within the first year, but Dan Thorning, a housing officer, acknowledges there have been challenges.“It can take significant time to build rapport and trust with some owners of empty homes, or to get contractors on board that are willing to work on a project where there are complex issues,” he says. “Sometimes when owners refuse to work with us, we have no choice but to use enforcement powers to bring their properties back into use.”Plymouth is following the lead of Kent county council, whose pioneering no use empty initiative won a prestigious regeneration award earlier in 2018. Its interest-free loans have helped to transform 5,400 empty homes since 2005.In Stoke-on-Trent, the council has allowed people to buy derelict homes for just £1, on the condition they stay for 10 years and commit to investing in the property. The relative success of such projects has helped fuel calls for community-led housing to play a greater role in alleviating the housing shortage, which has coincided with home ownership falling to a 30-year low.The Giroscope group in Yorkshire also refurbishes empty homes for subsidised housing, and has had success branching out into a microbrewery, bakery, condiment manufacturer and a vegetarian cafe and shop. Profits are reinvested into the business, but funding remains the key challenge.A government scheme, the empty homes programme, was set up in 2012 to provide about £100m to community groups for refurbishments. It was ended by the Conservative government in 2015. Swingeing funding cuts to local authorities have further undermined renewal schemes, while the money is drying up for charities too more than £3.8bn in government grants has been cut over the past decade.Banks can charge twice the rate of interest for loans to social enterprises as to commercial firms, if they agree to lend at all. This can hobble local startups and force them to lease rather than buy properties, meaning they ultimately return to the owner after refurbishment.Transferring empty properties to organisations which refurbish them and offer them to let at below local housing allowance rates means local authorities benefit from council tax receipts, the area gradually repopulates and the social enterprises can use the assets to raise money to buy more properties.The alternative is councils paying millions for emergency accommodation because they do not have enough housing stock to deliver their statutory duty to house homeless people, nor the funds to renovate the properties themselves, while whole neighbourhoods elsewhere are cut loose to rot.The homeless charity Centrepoint say that schemes like these provide some of the vulnerable people in society with a chance to develop the skills they need to get on in life.“These community led schemes offer a fantastic opportunity for them, and all those who unfortunately face homelessness, by not only providing affordable housing but also the hands-on experience and support to develop the key skills they will need in the world of work,” said Paul Noblet, its head of public affairs. “We hope that the example set by these schemes will inspire both government and employers to take similar action.”The housing charity Empty Homes says the absence of dedicated national funding means community-based approaches are more important than ever. These have a proven track record and they offer the best returns in financial, social and housing terms.“These organisations see beyond profit to save those in housing need,” says Chris Bailey, a campaign manager at Empty Homes. “They do so while delivering lower costs and better social outcomes reinvesting in more affordable housing and improving the local area.”This translates into people such as Martyn Jones finding a path to a better life rather than heading further out into the margins. “I wouldn’t know where my life would be heading without Campus,” he says. “This gives me hope for the future.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Commercial operations are due to begin next week.“The journey between the Haramain (two holy mosques) is now shorter and easier than at any time before,” the Saudi transport minister, Nabil al-Amoudi, told dignitaries gathered at the Jeddah station. “The project highlights the kingdom’s commitment to serving Islam and Muslims.”Pilgrimage is the backbone of a plan to expand tourism under economic reforms announced two years ago by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to ersify the economy. The hajj, a journey every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must perform once in a lifetime, can be a profound experience.It is also big business for Saudi Arabia. The hajj and the year-round lesser pilgrimage, umrah, generate billions of dollars in revenues from worshippers’ lodging, transport, gifts, food and fees.The new rail link was built by a Spanish-led consortium and financed by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. It halves travel time between Mecca, the spiritual heart of Islam, and Medina, its second most sacred site.Project manager Mohammed Fallatah said the train would offer fast and reliable transportation to pilgrims as well as Saudis and foreign residents.“The traveller will be comfortable. He can read books or magazines or enjoy watching the screens in business class, have a coffee or a light meal,” he said before Tuesday’s ceremony.The authorities hope the train will also stimulate growth of King Abdullah Economic City, a massive business zone that was initiated under the previous ruler but remains relatively empty.It will eventually link up with a new terminal at Jeddah airport, which has already started serving select domestic routes and will take over all flights by early next year.Fatallah said further expansion could include connecting to a planned east-west train between the capital, Riyadh, and Jeddah.Pilgrims comprise the bulk of Saudi Arabia’s 20 million annual foreign visitors, apart from workers and business travellers. More than 2 million came for this year’s hajj and 6.5 million performed umrah in 2017.Officials aim to increase the number of umrah and hajj pilgrims to 15 million and five million respectively by 2020, and hope to double the umrah number again to 30 million by 2030.In addition to public transit, Saudi Arabia is investing tens of billions of dollars in mega-hotels and a Grand Mosque restoration in Mecca.The Faisaliah project, running from the edge of Mecca towards the Red Sea, aims to attract visitors to coastal getaways and Islamic research centres."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66bfe21729e3edd3fdf33129b2fcf2e6ece4477e/0_117_3197_1919/master/3197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=975f5b0fd09996fbc4a91cc147dbfa89","title":"us sanctions venezuela first lady vice president","story":"Trump administration slaps financial sanctions on four members of Nicolás Maduro’s inner circle on allegations of corruptionThe Trump administration has slapped financial sanctions on four members of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro’s inner circle, including his wife and the country’s vice-president, on allegations of corruption.As part of the actions, the US barred Americans from doing business with and will seize any financial assets in the US belonging to the first lady, Cilia Flores, Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, the communications minister, Jorge Rodríguez, and defence minister, Vladimir Padrino.“We are continuing to designate loyalists who enable Maduro to solidify his hold on the military and the government while the Venezuelan people suffer,” the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said in a statement. “Treasury will continue to impose a financial toll on those responsible for Venezuela’s tragic decline, and the networks and frontmen they use to mask their illicit wealth.”Over the past two years the Trump administration has sanctioned dozens of iniduals, including Maduro himself, on allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses.But until now it had spared key leaders such as Delcy Rodríguez, as well as the US-trained Padrino, believing they occupy seats of power and could play a key role in an eventual transition.David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has spent more than two decades living and working in Venezuela, said Tuesday’s actions would seem to suggest the US has given up trying to sow ision within the government in the hopes it could force a democratic transition from within.“This clearly breaks from that strategy, said Smilde. “If everyone is sanctioned then it could end up uniting the government.”Trump, arriving at the United Nations general assembly before his speech Tuesday, said Venezuela is “a very sad case and we want to see it fixed. What’s happening there is a human tragedy.”But beyond rallying Maduro’s opponents, it is unclear what impact the sanctions will have.For more than a year, top US officials have struggled to build support for more sweeping oil sanctions, facing resistance from energy companies still active in the country and fearing it could tip the Opec nation over the edge at a time of hyperinflation and widespread food and medicine shortages.As part of the actions announced on Tuesday, the US Department of the Treasury also seized a $20m private jet belonging to an alleged frontman for powerful socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello."},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"Employees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interviewMy career path: Stephen McGrath works for the property department at LidlMy career path: Kyle Moore works with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639655.1537796718!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tidy towns the full list of winners for 2018","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWestport, Co Mayo, which was named tidiest large town in this year’s Tidy Towns competition.

Incumbent President Michael D Higgins can and has nominated himself to run for re-election. Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada received the support of 20 Oireachtas members from her party.The other four contenders Independent Senator Joan Freeman, and three Dragons’ Den panellists Seán Gallagher, Peter Casey, and Gavin Duffy, all received the backing of four local authorities. Here is a round-up of the decisions taken by each local authority:Businessman Mr Duffy won the endorsement by 14 votes to two, with members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour supporting him. The only other candidate to be proposed and seconded in Waterford was journalist and campaigner Gemma O’Doherty, who was backed by Independent councillors Seán Reinhardt and Joe Kelly.Dublin City Council voted not to endorse any candidate for the 2018 presidential election. Six presidential hopefuls were present in the council chamber on Thursday, September 13th, to plead their case for a nomination for the upcoming election. A theatrical presentation from Norma Burke, also know as Bunty Twuntingdon-McFuff, led to outrage and disgust from councillors in attendance.Kilkenny County Council voted not to nominate any candidates for the 2018 presidential election. A motion to nominate Gemma O’Doherty was defeated on Monday, 5-7, with 11 abstentions.Seán Gallagher’s name went back on the presidential ballot paper after Wexford County Council approved his nomination early on Monday afternoon. Mr Gallagher was one of two nominees, the other being Ms Freeman. Mr Gallagher secured 16 votes from Fianna Fáil and Independent councillors in the 34-person council and Ms Freeman received 10.Galway County Council has nominated Senator Joan Freeman to stand as a candidate in the presidential election. Ms Freeman was one of three candidates nominated at a special meeting of Galway County Council. Also nominated were Mr Casey and Mr Gallagher, although Mr Gallagher did not attend to make a presentation. Ms Freeman won by 12 votes to seven for Mr Casey and six for Mr Gallagher.Two nominations – that of Ms Freeman and Mr Gallagher – had been made to Galway City Council after a presentation by nine candidates to councillors last week. Mr Gallagher indicated he would be happy to withdraw as he had already secured the support of four local authorities. Seven councillors supported Ms Freeman, there was one vote against, and eight abstentions, while two councillors were absent.Former RTÉ Dragons’ Den panellist Peter Casey and journalist Gemma O’Doherty attended a special meeting of Monaghan County Council to seek support for their selection.

Photograph: Pau BarrenaAFPGetty ImagesManuel Valls was born 56 years ago in Barcelona, but his Swiss mother and Catalan father, a well-known painter, moved to Paris to escape Franco’s rule. He was naturalised a French citizen at the age of 20 and rose through the ranks of the socialist party to become François Hollande’s interior minister (2012-2014), then prime minister (2014-2016).Now, in what may prove to be an unprecedented act of self-reinvention and political resurrection, Valls is set to announce his candidacy to become mayor of Barcelona at a “civic event” at the Centre of Contemporary Culture in Barcelona on Tuesday evening.No head of a European government has pursued a political career in another EU country. The closest parallels are the 19th-century statesman Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was born in Nice and served in both the Italian and French parliaments, and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who was elected four times an MEP, twice as a German and twice as a French man.Valls says his interest in the Barcelona town hall is “an illustration of European citizenship”. Whether or not he wins, it may be a one-way trip. His prolonged absence has angered fellow deputies in the French National Assembly. And constituents in the Paris suburb of Evry, who Valls represented since 2002, feel abandoned. \u0026nbspWhile Valls spent more and more time in Barcelona this year, “nobody was in charge here”, a retired woman in Evry told Le Parisien newspaper. “The politicians all take us for fools. They ask us to vote for them, and then a year later they go away ... ”When Valls visited then taoiseach Enda Kenny in Dublin in April 2015, many French people fervently hoped for a presidential contest between Valls and the conservative politician Alain Juppé. It never happened. Rarely has such a promising political career fizzled out so inauspiciously.As interior minister, Valls had been the scourge of itinerant Roma. In the midst of jihadist attacks, his rhetoric was interpreted as Islamophobic. Things started going wrong for Valls when he took his sons on a government jet to a football match in Berlin. He was perceived as ill-tempered and over-ambitious.In a humiliating blow, Valls was defeated in the socialist presidential primary in January 2017. He nearly lost the seat he had held for 15 years in subsequent legislative elections, scraping through by only 139 votes over his far-left challenger from the France Unbowed party.Valls’s Catalan critics say he has come to Barcelona only because he was shoved aside by President Emmanuel Macron. Sources close to both politicians confirm the deep antipathy between them.When Macron was economy minister under Valls, he blamed Valls for gutting his reforms of bus transport and Sunday trading, then depriving Macron of the satisfaction of a parliamentary vote by passing his law by decree.It was a nightmare for Valls to see the young upstart with virtually no political experience snatch France’s highest political office from under his nose. To add insult to injury, Macron refused to allow Valls to stand for the National Assembly on the En Marche! ticket.Both Macron and Valls are pro-European social democrats who have been accused of veering to the right. Like Macron, Valls says the left-right ide in politics is outdated. Valls’s campaign in Barcelona looks set to mimic Macron’s winning formula.The centre-right Spanish party Ciudadanos (Citizens) supports Valls, but he may prefer to stand as an independent, in the hope of winning votes across as broad a spectrum as possible.A year after the referendum on Catalan independence, most of the leaders of the separatist movement are in prison or in exile, like the former president of the region, Carles Puigdemont, who lives in Belgium. Pro-Spanish Catalans believe they have found an articulate spokesman in Valls.Valls’s private life has followed the twists and turns of his political career. He had four children with his first wife, a school teacher. He and his second wife, a concert violinist, announced they were orcing last April. Valls had a brief liaison with the spokeswoman for the En Marche! group in the National Assembly.Then he was introduced to Susana Gallardo (53), the fabulously wealthy heiress to the Almirall pharmaceutical fortune and ex-wife of the owner of the Pronovias chain of wedding dress stores.Gallardo owns a mansion in Menorca and an apartment in Barcelona, where Valls now lives. Like Valls, she is a passionate advocate of Spanish unity. Valls’s detractors back in Paris say Gallardo’s influence and contacts book may be the most attractive things about her."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639723.1537798381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer has michael atiyah conquered the everest of mathematics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn undated portrait of German mathematician Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866). Riemann established the foundations of modern differential geometry and, in 1859, formulated the hypothesis that bears his name.  Photograph: BettmannGetty ImagesA major mathematical result has been announced by British-Lebanese mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah. In a talk at the 6th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in Germany on Monday Atiyah outlined what he described as “a simple proof using a radically new approach” of the Riemann hypothesis – the most celebrated problem in modern mathematics.The Riemann hypothesis (RH) was highlighted by the great German mathematician David Hilbert at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. Hilbert remarked: “If I were to awaken after sleeping for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?” The proof (or refutation) may come tomorrow, or we may have to wait for a century or more. The Riemann hypothesis is the Everest of mathematics.When asked which mathematicians he most admired, Atiyah named Bernhard Riemann and Irishman William Rowan Hamilton. Riemann established the foundations of modern differential geometry and, in 1859, formulated the hypothesis that bears his name. His work had a profound influence on the mathematics of the 20th century. He was very far in advance of his times, a deep and innovative mathematician. Riemannian geometry was the framework for Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Hamilton formulated what we call Hamiltonian mechanics, and invented quaternions. All the numbers we are familiar with, the “real numbers”, can be arranged as points on a line. But we can also consider points in a plane these give a richer set of numbers, the complex numbers. Each point in the plane has co-ordinates (a, b) and it was Hamilton who first gave the rules for multiplying pairs of numbers. This led him on to the more complicated quaternions numbers in four-dimensional space. It is obvious that x - 4 is zero when x  4. We say that the function f (x)  x - 4 has a zero at x  4. You may recall solving quadratic equations at school: these have two zeros. The Riemann zeta function is much trickier, and has an infinity of zeros. This function, defined by Riemann, takes a value for each point in the complex plane. Some of these values are zero: the negative even numbers, -2, -4, and so on all yield zero. Riemann believed the remaining zeros are on a vertical line, the critical line, in the complex plane. This is the Riemann hypothesis which, despite strenuous efforts, has never been proven. The RH can be formulated in erse and seemingly unrelated ways, some of which look deceptively simple: many statements equivalent to RH involve only real numbers. The hypothesis is inextricably intertwined with the distribution of prime numbers (primes cannot be expressed as products of smaller numbers), and the proof would have major consequences in number theory. Michael Berry of Bristol University encapsulates the hypothesis in the phrase “the primes have music in them”.Born in London in 1929, Atiyah was awarded a doctorate at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1955 for a thesis entitled Some Applications of Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry. One of the leading mathematicians of the 20th century and still at the coal-face, Atiyah has spent most of his academic life in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the Abel Prize in 2004. Both of these awards are considered comparable to a Nobel Prize. His main interests have been in algebraic geometry, index theory and gauge theory. His best known result, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, proved in 1963, makes connections between geometry and quantum field theory. He has collaborated with many leading mathematicians and his work has revealed important interactions between geometry and physics. The proof presented by Atiyah depends on a new function called the Todd function, and is underpinned by ideas introduced by John von Neumann, a giant among 20th century mathematics. In his analytical theory, von Neumann introduced “the infinite iteration of exponentials”. The Todd function is related to the fine structure constant of fundamental physics, and Atiyah said that he “stumbled upon the proof” of RH while studying the fine structure constant. The proof is by contradiction: Atiyah assumes a zero off the critical line and shows that this leads to an impossible result. Therefore, the hypothesis must be true and the theorem is proved! Proof of RH has been outstanding for 160 years. Many reputable mathematicians have attempted and failed to prove it. Atiyah’s result, if right, would be a dramatic breakthrough. There is very little chance that he is correct: major proofs normally require large advances in understanding, while Atiyah has claimed a “simple proof”. His outline may lead to a complete proof or, more likely, may amount to nothing. In recent years, Atiyah has claimed to have proved other remarkable results but has failed to convince his peers. It seems incredible that Atiyah is right, but we will have to await the judgment of experts before we learn if he will collect the $1 million Millennium Prize.Prof Peter Lynch writes the That’s Maths column on The  science page and is emeritus professor at UCD School of Mathematics \u0026amp Statistics"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn we re ready for a general election","story":"  September 23, 2018Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said the party must back members on new Brexit vote   September 23, 2018Agreement should have \u0026lsquosame benefits\u0026rsquo as customs union and single market membership   September 24, 2018Delegates at party conference on Tuesday are expected to support another referendum "},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

They are highly social species, living in pods of between two and 25, and communicating with high-frequency sounds. They have even been known to mimic human language.Once considered endangered, the beluga was reassessed last year and it is now listed ‘of least concern’ by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).Richard Sabin, Principal Curator of Mammals at the Natural History Museum, said the video footage of the whale suggested strongly it was a beluga.“The white body colour, absence of a prominent dorsal fin, bulbous forehead and general swimming motion all suggest this very strongly.“The beluga is an Arcticsub-Arctic species, so is a long way outside its usual range of distribution.”Please review our commenting policyBill Cosby sentenced to three to 10 years in jail for sexual assaultComment: Iran will be harder than North Korea, Mr President - the ayatollahs are zealots, not politiciansLife expectancy falls in Scotland for first time in 35 yearsAttack on civilians threatens Ebola response in DRC\u0026#39Beginning of end\u0026#39 for Angela Merkel as chancellor defeated in party rebellionTainted blood scandal: records were falsified to paint victims as addicts and alcoholics, inquiry hearsMystery of Origin of the World finally laid bare as scandalous Courbet painting\u0026#39s model revealedComment: Labour are stuck in the past... and that’s just the way they like itSir Keir Starmer says \u0026#39nobody is ruling out Remain as an option\u0026#39, while Article 50 could be extendedGainsborough discovery: how bequest from murdered uncle set artist on path to fame US midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?Criminal who spat blood at police officer given community order, as PC says court has \u0026#39let them down\u0026#39Comment: Chuck Chequers, Theresa, and you\u0026#39ll save your career, unite the country and crush LabourTB vaccine shows early promise as world leaders gather to discuss wiping out diseaseJeremy Corbyn declines to rule out stopping Brexit, as shadow frontbencher says Remain forces are \u0026#39anti-democratic\u0026#39UN General Assembly 2018: Trump forced to pause amid laughter at claims he has \u0026#39accomplished almost more than any administration\u0026#39Canada-style Brexit trade agreement with EU would be worse than no-deal, says Theresa May\u0026#39The reluctant Remainer\u0026#39: Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s long history of opposition to the EUWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/25/TELEMMGLPICT000173171115_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqHgTv8HPfBVpZECAYOC1TI0klW67ZKazFSUg_RL8azUI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"days dictate us poland vows build baltic sea canal bypass russia","story":"Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the governing party, said Poland should sever the last vestiges of Russian influenceThe president of Poland\u0027s ruling party has said the country will push ahead with plans to cut a canal through a split of land near the Russian border saying it is time show the Russians the days they dictated to us are over.Poland wants to dig the canal through a narrow strip of land that blocks the Vistula Lagoon on the north-east coast from the Baltic Sea. At present Polish ships leaving the lagoon from the port of Elblag have to pass through Russian waters to get to the open sea.Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Law and Justice, the governing party, and a man regarded as the most powerful figure in Polish politics, said the necessity to sever the last vestiges of Russian influence over Poland means the canal has to be built.  “It is important for Poland’s status,” he said in a radio interview. “In the end Poland needs to shed the last traces of being a dependent state. We need to show that that times Russia dictated what we could or not do on our territory are over.”Earlier this month Russia complained to the European Commission about the canal. In a letter to the Commission’s environment and maritime affairs commissionaire, Moscow complained that it had not been consulted over the canal and that the construction of the waterway threatened the ecology of the lagoon.When questioned about Russia’s letter, Mr Kaczynski said that “they have always been opposed to it”. The Polish government has also dismissed Moscow complaints as an “attempt to block this strategic investment for Poland”.Construction on the canal, which will be 1,100 yards long and 16 feet deep, is due to start later this year and should be completed by 2022.Please review our commenting policyBill Cosby sentenced to three to 10 years in jail for sexual assaultComment: Iran will be harder than North Korea, Mr President - the ayatollahs are zealots, not politiciansLife expectancy falls in Scotland for first time in 35 yearsAttack on civilians threatens Ebola response in DRC\u0026#39Beginning of end\u0026#39 for Angela Merkel as chancellor defeated in party rebellionTainted blood scandal: records were falsified to paint victims as addicts and alcoholics, inquiry hearsMystery of Origin of the World finally laid bare as scandalous Courbet painting\u0026#39s model revealedComment: Labour are stuck in the past... and that’s just the way they like itSir Keir Starmer says \u0026#39nobody is ruling out Remain as an option\u0026#39, while Article 50 could be extendedGainsborough discovery: how bequest from murdered uncle set artist on path to fame US midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?Criminal who spat blood at police officer given community order, as PC says court has \u0026#39let them down\u0026#39Comment: Chuck Chequers, Theresa, and you\u0026#39ll save your career, unite the country and crush LabourTB vaccine shows early promise as world leaders gather to discuss wiping out diseaseJeremy Corbyn declines to rule out stopping Brexit, as shadow frontbencher says Remain forces are \u0026#39anti-democratic\u0026#39UN General Assembly 2018: Trump forced to pause amid laughter at claims he has \u0026#39accomplished almost more than any administration\u0026#39Canada-style Brexit trade agreement with EU would be worse than no-deal, says Theresa May\u0026#39The reluctant Remainer\u0026#39: Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s long history of opposition to the EUWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2018/05/29/TELEMMGLPICT000040906057_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=45","title":"eu judges spare meps blushes secretive expenses","story":"The European Parliament in Strasbourg, France: one of the two seats of the institution where MEPs can claim a daily allowance just for turning upEuropean Court of JusticeEU judges have refused to shed light on the European Parliament’s notoriously secretive system of expenses and claimed that doing so would infringe MEPs’ right to privacy.The £3,937 a month General Expenditure Allowance is paid directly into every MEP’s account on top of their monthly salary to cover expenses such as hotels, travel and restaurant bills.But there is no need to provide receipts or return unspent cash from the payment, which costs taxpayers across the EU an estimated £35.8 million a year.The General Court, a lower chamber of the European Court of Justice, on Tuesday rejected a case brought by a consortium of investigative journalists over the allowance.Judges in Luxembourg said making details public would violate MEPs’ privacy, backing a European Parliament decision to refuse the information request.The court also refused to allow the information to be handed over in a redacted format to avoid EU data protection rules.It said that would prove too burdensome on the parliament and render the request pointless because it would be impossible to monitor inidual MEPs’ expenditure.The consortium of investigative journalists found widespread abuses of the system in 2017, including payments to MEPs’ personal accounts. In many cases it was impossible to find out how money was spent because there was no paper trail.At a glance | European Court of JusticeThe court’s decision, which can be appealed,  sparked outrage among campaigners and some MEPs who want more transparency.Transparency International’s Nick Aiossa said, “The European Court of Justice has dealt a severe blow to transparency today by allowing the European Parliament to keep MEP allowance spending completely secret from the public.“At a time when trust in the EU institutions is so low, this is a ridiculous message ahead of next year’s European elections.”Conservative MEPs\u0027 leader Ashley Fox said that Tory MEPs had submitted their expenses for independent audit and published summaries of them for the last nine years.We believe the European Parliament should now demand that all MEPs copy this approach to restore and maintain public confidence in the system, he said.The European Parliament has long been criticised for its opaque expenses system, which top up the average £86,700 a year MEPs’ salary, which is subject to a “community tax” rate that can be as little as 12 per cent.As well as the General Expenditure Allowance, MEPs can pocket, without any need for a paper trail of receipts, a daily allowance of £280 simply for turning up to the parliament and signing a register. In July, the parliament rejected reforms that would have introduced basic scrutiny of the allowance. Brexit Bulletin promotion - end of articleEuropean Court of JusticePlease review our commenting policyCost of a tank of petrol could hit record high of over £70, RAC predicts  Bill Cosby sentenced to three to 10 years in jail for sexual assaultComment: Iran will be harder than North Korea, Mr President -

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. According to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured\u0026nbspexchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31.

The affordable fashion brand, known for its handbag range,\u0026nbspwill change its name to Capri Holdings once the deal has closed, the firm said.John D. Idol, chairman and chief executive officer of Michael Kors Holdings, said the deal was “an important milestone for our group”. “For over 40 years, Versace has represented the epitome of Italian fashion luxury, a testament to the brand’s timeless heritage. We are excited to have Versace as part of our family of luxury brands, and we are committed to investing in its growth,” he said. “With the full resources of our group, we believe that Versace will grow to over $2bn in revenues. We believe that the strength of the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands, and the acquisition of Versace, position us to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth.”Confirmation of the sale comes after fans called on Versace to put a stop to the sale. The Italian luxury brand was founded by Gianni Versace 40 years ago. After Mr Versace was murdered in 1997, his family took over the company. The Versace family currently have an 80 per cent stake in the company, while the remaining 20 per cent is held by private equity group Blackstone, which bought into the firm in 2014, with plans to list it on the stock market.However, Blackstone is reported to have found the investment disappointing, and abandoned its plans for a float some time ago.Versace to stop using fur in its collectionsMost people are pronouncing Versace wrongAmerican Crime Story revives fascination in Versace\u0027s deathDonatella Versace, the group’s vice president and chief designer, said: “This is a very exciting moment for Versace.

I am proud that Versace remains very strong in both fashion and modern culture. “Versace is not only synonymous with its iconic and unmistakable style, but with being inclusive and embracing of ersity, as well as empowering people to express themselves. Santo, Allegra and I recognize that this next step will allow Versace to reach its full potential.”Ms Versace added: “We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace’s long-term success. My passion has never been stronger. This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.“Santo, Allegra and I will become shareholders in Capri Holdings. This demonstrates our belief in the long-term success of Versace and commitment to this new global fashion luxury group.”The purchase of Versace is the second major deal announced by Michael Kors in the last 18 months - the company bought shoe designer Jimmy Choo for £921m last year.

The musical really works live.”Whether he would appear in the stage version himself has yet to be confirmed but he has form in the genre and\u0026nbspmembers of his supporting cast have been widely tipped to return.Actress Skylar Dunn, who played Young Charity on screen, has already volunteered.How can I get my Greatest Showman fix in the\u0026nbspmeantime?Fear not. The film itself is out now on Blu-ray, DVD\u0026nbspand download and the official soundtrack continues to be a best-seller, lingering in the charts like a backstage phantom and allowing fans to relive their favourite moments.The Prince Charles Cinema in London’s Leicester Square has also\u0026nbsprun sing-along screenings throughout the year and special showings are being regularly programmed in cinemas across the country to cope with demand.The best films of 2018 (so far)From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien.

The information will be presented in graphs, and users are offered the ability to ban themselves from specific apps, for instance.But those charts – intended as a way of allowing people to better control their use of their phone – have turned out to be more than a little horrifying to many users. Many appear to have used their last few minutes of available time to tweet about just how miserable their incessant tweeting is making them.Others embraced ignorance as a way of avoiding the horrifying graphs.Many found, however that the feature is actually working – despite or perhaps because of the feelings of shame. The feature was introduced by Apple as a way of allowing people to use their phone for what they actually want to do, which appears to be paying off.One important group affected by the changes are children. Apple allows the Screen Time feature to be controlled within families – meaning, for instance, that parents can set limits for their children, who can ask for more time if they need it.Screen Time is just one of a vast range of features introduced in iOS 12, Apple\u0027s latest iPhone update. They also include other features intended on improving people\u0027s relationship with their phone, including alterations to the way notifications work.The feature should nudge users into using it when the latest update is installed.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/17/11/aran-islands-cart-1950s-ireland.jpg","title":"travel ireland aran islands visit travel accommodation to do remote","story":"Created with Sketch.At the end of the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, playwright JM Synge\u0026nbspescaped to the\u0026nbspstripped back and simple life on\u0026nbspInishmore, Inishmaan\u0026nbspand Inisheer. Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”We both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/25/11/weetbix-weetabix.jpg","title":"new zealand weetabix boxes weetbix british sanitarium christchurch cereal","story":"Created with Sketch.Court rules that British product could be confused with Weet-BixClick to followThe IndependentScores of Weetabix boxes will be destroyed in New Zealand after the company behind rival breakfast brand\u0026nbspWeet-bix, won\u0026nbspa trademark dispute.Food manufacturer\u0026nbspSanitarium took the owners of\u0026nbspChristchurch grocers A Little Bit of Britain\u0026nbspto the country\u0027s High\u0026nbspCourt, where they claimed that\u0026nbspcustomers, largely expats\u0026nbspfrom the UK,\u0026nbspmight mistake the\u0026nbspBritish\u0026nbspproduct for its own.When a pallet of around 300 boxes of Weetabix\u0026nbsparrived in the country in June, they were impounded by customs officers following a complaint from\u0026nbspSanitarium.\u0026nbspKylie Jenner has only just tried adding milk to her cerealWeed-killing chemical linked to cancer found in children\u0027s cerealsYoung boy dies \u0027after mistaking father\u0027s meth for cereal\u0027The firm also\u0026nbspsent a letter to Lisa Wilson, the shop\u0027s co-owner, informing her that the cereal would\u0026nbsponly be released if a sticker was put over their labels\u0026nbspand she blanked out the name Weetabix when selling it online.While other stores complied with their request, Ms Wilson\u0026nbspaccused the company of “bullying” her small family business and refused to back down.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAs a result he said that\u0026nbspWeetabix can only be sold in specialist UK stores and the word must be covered to protect the Weet-Bix brand.A survey, released by the court found that 35 per cent of people mistook Weetabix as a Sanitarium product.Weetabix products imported for other than private or domestic use must be destroyed, meaning the 108 boxes which arrived earlier this year, had to be destroyed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSanitarium general manager Rob Scoines welcomed the ruling, saying that it was vital that the company protected their brand.It\u0027s not so much about Little Bit of Britain selling Weetabix, but more about the protection of the Weet-Bix trademark, Mr Scoines\u0026nbsptold The New Zealand Herald.\u0026nbspThe judgment enables us to protect our brand, which supports the employment of New Zealanders and contributes to the community.World news in picturesPresident Donald Trump and US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, talk with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres during the General Assembly at UN HeadquartersIranian President Hassan Rouhani has claimed that his country is ready to confront America, following an attack on a military parade in Ahvaz in which 25 people were killed.

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. According to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound.

He said that the animal had not been moving around much, and that it appeared to be feeding.For anyone twitching the beluga, it\u0027s been feeding around the barges for the last hour and hasn\u0027t moved more than 200 metres in either direction, he wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspStill present.But experts warned that the whale should be left alone as much as possible, to ensure its safety.Probably not good that this beluga is in the Thames, said Sarah Dolman from Whale and Dolphin Conservation.\u0026nbspPlease give the whale space!Getting too close to the whale could cause it to become distressed, which could put it in danger.One thing we’re trying to stress is that members of the public keen to catch a glimpse of the whale should do so in a respectful manner, said\u0026nbspLucy Babey, head of science and conservation at\u0026nbspwhale\u0026nbsporganisation\u0026nbspOrca.\u0026nbspKeep away from the mammal and avoid causing any distress.Beluga whales can be as big as 20 metres long. They are usually found in the Arctic Ocean, but as winter arrives and the sea freezes often head south in large groups.They can be identified from their all-white appearance as well as the lack of a dorsal fin.It\u0027s not clear why a beluga would have gone all the way up the Thames, said Babey.“It could have followed a food source. It could have become disorientated or It could have been motivated by a disturbance.“Won’t know for sure why it’s here unless we examine its carcass, which obviously we don’t want to do.“British Divers Marine Life Rescue will be on the look-out and prepared to shepherd it back out to see if need be.”In 2006, a young,\u0026nbsp18ft\u0026nbspbottlenose whale swam up the Thames and began a flurry of speculation as people watched to see whether experts could save it. She was chased up the river by hundreds of people who hoped she could be saved.But she could not be saved and died as rescuers tried to lift her out of the river.It was the first time such a whale had been seen in the river since 1913.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to

latest party conference","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027We cannot obviously leave in current circumstances, we need to extend Article 50....I don’t know how long that would take\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsEmily Thornberry acknowledged that – should Labour succeed in forcing an election – the clock would have to be stopped on BrexitLabour government should delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, says Emily ThornberryEmily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a snap general election.The shadow foreign secretary insisted the UK could not leave the EU “in current circumstances”, as she set out what the party’s election strategy would be.“In our manifesto we should say we will abide by the result of the referendum, we cannot obviously leave in current circumstances, we need to extend Article 50 and - let me pre-empt your next question - I don’t know how long that would take,” she told a conference fringe meeting.Labour would then restart the negotiations by going to Brussels and saying “the grown ups have turned up now,\u0026nbsplet’s sit down and talk”.The comments make Ms Thornberry the first Labour frontbencher to acknowledge\u0026nbspthat – should Labour succeed in forcing an election – the clock would have to be stopped on Brexit.It is believed the EU would probably agree to an application to extend Article 50, to allow a new government to put forward its exit proposals, but it would require the agreement of all 27 other EU countries.The development came after\u0026nbspKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary,\u0026nbspwon a huge ovation from the conference\u0026nbspfor insisting Labour was not “ruling out” an option to Remain on the ballot paper of any fresh referendum.The sentence, which was not signed off by Mr Corbyn’s office, opened up fresh isions at the Liverpool conference, where\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, had\u0026nbspappeared to rule out that option.The standing ovation for Sir Keir suggested that the opinion polls - suggesting overwhelming support among Labour members for a people\u0027s vote and the chance to vote Remain - are correct.Later, the conference passed a motion to keep open the option of another referendum, reading: “If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.”At the fringe meeting, Ms Thornberry defended Jeremy Corbyn’s strategy of pressing for a general election, rather than a fresh referendum on Brexit, insisting that was the best way to “inject democracy” into the controversy.And she said: “I think there’s going to be a general election and I think we are going to win.”The shadow foreign secretary also cast huge doubt on whether a further referendum offering the public the chance to stay in the EU would produce a different result.Voters were “dug in” to their positions in the 2016 referendum, rather than switching to the Remain cause – as might be expected with the government’s strategy floundering.And, controversially, she blamed hardcore Remainers for that deadlock, by giving the impression that people voted Leave because they “are stupid, because they are racist, because they have been lied to, because they have been manipulated”.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote

from having a general election into some segue, into a people’s vote.“I think there should be a general election – I think that’s the best people’s vote that you can have.”Arguing there was no public shift towards wanting to reverse the Brexit result, she said: “It is not that people have said it but, in the debate about Europe, it’s what people hear.“And I think people have been hearing the

Italian luxury brand follows acquisition of Jimmy Choo last yearClick to followThe IndependentVersace to be sold to Michael Kors, US company announcesMichael Kors has agreed to buy Italian fashion house Versace for $2.1bn (£1.6bn), the US company confirmed on Tuesday. The affordable fashion brand, known for its handbag range,\u0026nbspwill change its name to Capri Holdings once the deal has closed, the firm said.John D. Idol, chairman and chief executive officer of Michael Kors Holdings, said the deal was “an important milestone for our group”. “For over 40 years, Versace has represented the epitome of Italian fashion luxury, a testament to the brand’s timeless heritage. We are excited to have Versace as part of our family of luxury brands, and we are committed to investing in its growth,” he said. “With the full resources of our group, we believe that Versace will grow to over $2bn in revenues. We believe that the strength of the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands, and the acquisition of Versace, position us to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth.”Confirmation of the sale comes after fans called on Versace to put a stop to the sale. The Italian luxury brand was founded by Gianni Versace 40 years ago. After Mr Versace was murdered in 1997, his family took over the company. The Versace family currently have an 80 per cent stake in the company, while the remaining 20 per cent is held by private equity group Blackstone, which bought into the firm in 2014, with plans to list it on the stock market.However, Blackstone is reported to have found the investment disappointing, and abandoned its plans for a float some time ago.Versace to stop using fur in its collectionsMost people are pronouncing Versace wrongAmerican Crime Story revives fascination in Versace\u0027s deathDonatella Versace, the group’s vice president and chief designer, said: “This is a very exciting moment for Versace. It has been more than 20 years since I took over the company along with my brother Santo and daughter Allegra. I am proud that Versace remains very strong in both fashion and modern culture. “Versace is not only synonymous with its iconic and unmistakable style, but with being inclusive and embracing of ersity, as well as empowering people to express themselves. Santo, Allegra and I recognize that this next step will allow Versace to reach its full potential.”Ms Versace added: “We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace’s long-term success. My passion has never been stronger. This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.“Santo, Allegra and I will become shareholders in Capri Holdings. This demonstrates our belief in the long-term success of Versace and commitment to this new global fashion luxury group.”The purchase of Versace is the second major deal announced by Michael Kors in the last 18 months - the company bought shoe designer Jimmy Choo for £921m last year.

Everything was ready, except a small but important detail: Jennyfer’s passport.It is now five months since Jennyfer Avero applied for her travel document. But, until today, the 23-year-old craftswoman from Caracas hasn’t anything about the state of her request.\u0026nbspLast month, her boyfriend Javier left for\u0026nbspEcuador, becoming part of one of the biggest exoduses in Latin American history. And in the meantime, Jennyfer continues to wait, hoping she will join him soon.“I have no alternative,” she says. “I wouldn’t like to leave without a passport.”Venezuela’s intensifying economic and political crisis has pushed hundreds of thousands to flee the country. They are in search of food, security, medicine and jobs.But not everyone\u0026nbspthat makes the decision to leave has a valid passport. Venezuelans face multiple difficulties when trying to obtain this document. Some people can wait months, or even years, to get it. The process can be complicated, expensive and sometimes illegal.Day after day crowds queue up outside the headquarters of the passport agency, known as Saime, in Caracas.Saime has more than 200 offices nationwide, however many people come to the headquarters in Caracas hoping to get a passport. Here the possibilities are greater, users say.Everyone is here – women, children, couples and elderly people. Some arrived before dawn\u0026nbspothers, those who came from afar, spent the night here. Much of them share the desire to leave the country for good.“This is the fourth time in three months I’ve come here,” says Jose Di Marco, while standing in line.Di Marco travelled 713km by bus from the town of Puerto Ordaz to Caracas. For the second consecutive day, the 20-year-old student has been sleeping at a nearby square to avoid losing his spot in the queue.He should be travelling to Ecuador at the end of the month. He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.“I’ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time,” he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory, the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.“It’s as if I had never attended the appointment,” says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her meeting.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It’s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Caracas’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest in the region, so it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 (£0.23) at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans,given the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the “mafia”\u0026nbspinside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his critics for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a “crisis moment”,\u0026nbspakin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans who had been travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1022533_1.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn labour jean luc melenchon","story":"                Labour on track to deliver \u0027HARDEST Brexit\u0027 if Jeremy Corbyn does THIS                Corbyn ally boasts of setting alarm EARLY \u0027to hate Margaret Thatcher\u0027\u0026ldquoBritish governments have always had an extremely arrogant and unpleasant attitude towards other Europeans and Europe, for its part, has always been odious to all its people.

Heres the latest.While a number of politicians and celebrities have added their voice to growing calls for a second referendum this has always been rejected by Downing Street.In September 2018 the mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham backed a second Brexit vote  there was a no-deal scenario - but warned it could trigger social unrest.Theresa Mays official spokesman has said: The British people have voted to leave the EU and there is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.It could depend on how Brits perceive Parliamentary squabbles over Mrs Mays Chequers deal.Theresa May called on Jeremy Corbyn to rule out a second vote on EU membership during PMQs, but the Labour leader failed to respond.Labour has been in a muddle over the issue too — with the leadership refusing to commit to a call for a second vote despite cries from centrist MPs and members.A sizeable section in the party want a second referendum and pressure is mounting on the left-wing leader.The GMB, one of the UKs biggest trade unions, called for a vote on the final Brexit deal.Later in September 2018, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan dramatically called for another EU referendum — saying that people must be given the opportunity to reject Brexit.The Mayor of London, who is an avowed remainer, argued Britain is facing either a bad deal or “no deal” which he says will hit jobs and living standards.Referring to the worst case scenerios, Mr Khan said: “They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods.” Party bosses have hinted theyll back a second referendum - but Jeremy Corbyns closest ally, John McDonnell, has ruled out keeping Britain in the EU.Labour bigwigs set out a new policy which could see the party supporting a fresh referendum  Theresa May refuses to call a General Election.But the policy was blown apart just hours later when Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell suggested the second referendum wouldnt include an option to remain in the EU.Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, the hard-left veteran said: “We’ve said we want a people’s vote  we can’t get a General Election.“We accept the last referendum - we want a General Election,  we can’t get that we want some form of democratic option.”Asked what form a second referendum would take, Mr McDonnell said: “It will be on the deal itself. We will respect the referendum.”Speaking to ITVs Good Morning Britain, he added: It will be about whether you accept the deal or not or whether you send people back to negotiate a proper deal.And he told BBC Radio 5 Live: My big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  its slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.Following John McDonnells comments, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Keir Starmer reaffirmed that the party have not ruled out calling for a second Brexit referendum.Ahead of a vote at the party conference on Tuesday September 25, the shadow Brexit secretary said that a motion on the highly isive question that has dominated the event in Liverpool doesnt rule out Remain.He told the Independent: The idea is to retain flexibility, the motion doesnt rule out Remain, it doesnt tie us to any position on what should be in any future vote.It was reported that he is due to tell the party conference in Liverpool: The party that once promised to fix the roof while the sun was shining now seems intent on burning the whole house down.Just when we need a strong government, what do we see from the Tories? Division, chaos and failure.No credible plan for Brexit. No solution to prevent a hard border in Ireland. And no majority in Parliament for the Chequers proposals.A Tory civil war that has gone on for years now threatens our future prosperity.Its reported he will add: If your party wants to tear itself apart, thats fine, but youre not taking our country with you.Setting out Labours approach to the upcoming Commons vote, Sir Keir said: If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No s, no buts.And  the Prime Minister thinks well wave through a vague deal asking us to jump blindfolded into the unknown, she can think again.You cant meet Labours tests by failing to provide answers. We will vote down a blind Brexit.Let me be clear: this isnt about frustrating the process. Its about stopping a destructive Tory Brexit. Its about fighting for our values. And about fighting for our country.According to Oddschecker, BetFred have offered offs of 9/4 for a second referendum on leaving the EU.A poll carried out by NatCen and The UK in Changing Europe revealed 59 percent of voters would now vote to remain in the EU, while 41 percent would opt to leave.The author of the poll John Curtice urged caution over the finding.He said the interview panel was skewed towards remain, and that some of the sht was among those who did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.The first referendum on EU membership took place in 1975.Two-thirds of voters  backed the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before. Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a better deal.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in 1993.In the summer of 2016, Britain voted to leave the EU after 17.4million people backed Leave compared to 16.1million Remain voters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU know this Government didn’t start properly planning for no deal until this summer.Senior figures there believe the UK will back down rather than go down a route it is so ill-prepared for.So Mrs May is trying to, publicly, burn her boats on the beach.To show that she can’t accept membership of the European Economic Area and the customs union, which would leave the UK as essentially a non-voting member of the EU, or the current Irish backstop, which would see Northern Ireland kept in the EU’s customs union even as the rest of the UK leaves it.One Downing Street source tells me all European leaders say they want an agreement.But a deal isn’t compatible with their Irish backstop proposal. So they’ll have to choose.If the EU doesn’t show any sign of moving in the next fortnight, Mrs May will come under real pressure to change tack from Chequers from her own Cabinet.“The problem is the Cabinet ministers who backed it on the grounds that it was doable,” one Secretary of State tells me. .A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that with the EU rejecting Chequers, Mrs May should turn to a more Canada-style approach — pushing for the free trade deal the EU has repeatedly said is on offer.“There’s an opportunity amid the embarrassment,” one member of this group tells me.No10 rejects this argument, saying a Canada-style deal doesn’t solve the Irish backstop problem.But these ministers think by moving away from Chequers, the UK could create the space for a compromise on the Irish border.Another problem is how blindsided No10 was by the Salzburg snub.This will make it harder for Downing Street to persuade ministers to trust its judgment on what compromises need to be made to get a deal.For instance, Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Europe adviser, wants us to commit to matching EU social and environmental regulations as well as product regulations.This is meant to deal with one of the EU’s objections to Chequers, that the UK could gain a competitive advantage by not following every new EU rule in these fields.But several key ministers have objections to this.They are now less likely to accept this compromise because they are far more sceptical of Robbins’ reading of the state of the negotiations.In the coming weeks, the Cabinet will become more and more assertive.They won’t all be pushing for the same thing — there are those who would prefer a customs union to a Canada-style deal — but they will demand greater input.For they nearly all worry about no deal.One Government source tells me: “We all know what no deal looks like, you can’t blunder into that.”What Mrs May must do in the coming weeks is give herself room for manoeuvre between no deal and signing up to a customs union.She is trying to do that by shocking the EU into engaging with Chequers.But  the EU won’t, then several key Cabinet ministers will push for a new approach ahead of the October EU Council.THERESA MAY has set up a small, kitchen Cabinet to consult on Brexit policy.It met in the first week of September and again on Tuesday this week.This new Cabinet grouping essentially replaces the Brexit inner Cabinet.Mrs May cooled on this Brexit inner Cabinet, which was designed to be balanced between those who campaigned for Brexit and those who had backed Remain, after it objected to her preferred customs plan.I understand that Philip Hammond forcibly made the point that such a balanced committee constrained her options.Those attending this meeting include the increasingly influential David Lidington, Chancellor Philip Hammond, the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, the chief whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who has taken charge of the mission of selling Chequers.In Whitehall, this new group has been dubbed “The Chequers Defence Committee” because of how much of its time is taken up with working out how to sell the Prime Minister’s Brexit proposals.The first meeting included a discussion of whether, and how, ministers should respond to Boris Johnson’s broadsides against Mrs May’s plan.The discussions have also revealed something about Mrs May’s relationship with her own MPs.It was agreed that the PM would meet with a series of Labour Brexiteers – Gisela Stuart, Frank Field and Kate Hoey – in the hope that they might be able to persuade some of her MPs to back her approach.This is quite extraordinary: A PM trying to get opposition figures to persuade her own party to back her plans.CABINET will meet on Monday to discuss Britain’s post-Brexit immigration policy.This is one of the most important decisions this Government will take.So it is absurd that, on Friday lunchtime, ministers still did not have the papers for the meeting.I understand, though, that the Government’s intention is to come up with a system that does not discriminate between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world.However, the UK will be prepared to discuss immigration as part of a trade deal. But this arrangement will not be free movement.Earlier this month, Mrs May told her closest Cabinet colleagues that this is one of the issues she is determined not to compromise on.What is required is an immigration system that encourages the best and the brightest to come here and ensures this country has the workers it needs.I UNDERSTAND there was a plan for Jeremy Corbyn to attend today’s Liverpool match against Southampton ahead of Labour’s conference in the city.But the club didn’t want him on the pitch, so Corbyn won’t get to score at the Kop end.Labour deny that there was any plan for Corbyn to go on to the pitch.IF No10 didn’t have enough to worry about ahead of Tory conference, there is the issue of Theresa May’s voice.She can ill afford a repeat of last year, when it kept giving out during the speech.In an attempt to prevent this from happening, her schedule will be pared right back. Mrs May will do some events designed to encourage more women into politics.But Cabinet Ministers will fill in for her at the ious regional receptions to try to save her voice.Mrs May’s voice isn’t No10’s only concern.One Cabinet minister tells me: “They are completely paranoid she is going to get slow hand-clapped.”This fear strikes me as misplaced.Activists who remember the agony of last year’s conference speech will give her credit for standing up and doing it all over again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Thursday they proved it, with their squalid ambush and the infantile taunting online.Mrs May has always treated EU leaders with respect. But these bullying egomaniacs, these swaggering posers in designer suits, lack the common decency to respect Britain, our Prime Minister and our democratic choice.So yesterday, on behalf of her position and the nation, she bit back. It was the best speech of her le. And her ­arguments were as unassailable as her welcome new tone was hostile.We CANNOT remain part of the EU’s institutions — and make a mockery of the referendum verdict. We WILL NOT split the UK. We WILL NOT annul the Brexit vote because they don’t like it.We CANNOT keep making sacrices and proposing solutions only for Brussels to reject them without any sensible counter offer. That’s not a negotiation.So, as Mrs May says, it’s stalemate. If, as The Sun expects, their response is more of the same, she should tell them this: “Here’s one final offer... not Chequers, but a simple free trade deal, plus security co-operation, that respects our referendum and your principles.“And since Michel Barnier now accepts that technology CAN police borders, let’s use it between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” If they spurn that, we’ll know they aren’t serious.We can leave with no deal, bank our £39billion orce payment and mitigate short-term damage by slashing taxes.We will lure businesses and talent from the continent and embrace those already here, as Mrs May has promised.And we will be free from the clutches of the Brussels club and the posturing pygmies running it.IS anyone more delusional or dishonest than the laughably-named People’s Vote campaign?These Remainiac losers pretend a second referendum is in the nation’s interests when it plainly only serves theirs.To get their way they would risk hideous disorder and the annihilation of trust in democracy. And they are utterly deluded about their chances of victory.Almost all Leavers would vote the same way, alongside many ex-Remainers who know the first vote must be honoured and now see the EU for what it truly is, especially after Thursday.But even  Remain won, why should anyone respect THEIR victory?It would never be sustainable. The fury at an EU which bullied us into a rerun would never subside. Nor would the rage at Remain diehards who ­colluded with Brussels to bring it about.The genie is out of the bottle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The first that the Prime Minister was clearly angered by their treatment of her.Regardless of their views on Chequers, she has the right to believe that as the UK has always treated the EU with respect, so EU leaders should show the UK the same respect in .Second is what I and others have been saying, that the best and most workable relationship after we leave is one based on a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.However,  we are to reach such an agreement, the EU must recognise that they will have to get rid of the demands for a Northern Irish border backstop, which blocks such a deal.The EU demand that either the UK as a whole stay in the Customs Union or that Northern Ireland is separated from the UK by a customs border is unacceptable and would harm our Union.In fact, a recent publication by two ex-Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland shows that there does not need to be a “hard” border with checkpoints or gates, and instead we could have a practical solution where goods flow freely between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In fact, such a system should be employed at all our borders around the UK, as this would greatly reduce the likelihood of customs problems at ports from Zeebrugge to Calais.So after months of manoeuvring, and poor advice from advisers in No10, now the choice is at least — and at last — crystal clear.The UK wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU but they need to cease demands about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Failing that, the UK will leave under terms which govern trade between nations around the world.No trade deal is better than a bad trade deal, so the ball is firmly in the EU’s court.By Priti Patel, Tory former Cabinet ministerOUTRAGEOUS, insulting and immature sums up the EU’s appalling behaviour to the UK and to our Prime Minister.These shenanigans from an out-of-touch EU elite serve to demonstrate why Britain was right to vote leave.Who wants to remain in a club where its senior unelected figures mock our great and proud country and shamefully ambush our PM?Not only has Britain bankrolled the EU for the past 45 years, the freedoms and liberties enjoyed by the Continent have been secured by our Armed Forces and the sacrices Britain made in two world wars.While we want to maintain strong, friendly and cordial relations with our friends and partners in Europe, Donald Tusk belittles the PM on social media and President Macron brands those who back Brexit as “liars”.Macron’s undiplomatic comments are an insult not only to the 17.4million people who backed Brexit but to the entire country.Their aim is simple. To reverse the result of the referendum and put Brussels back in charge.The British people deserve better than the EU humiliating and insulting us.We are a proud nation and will not stand for a Government that surrenders to unreasonable demands from Europe’s unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. This Government has already gone too far, with Chequers offering the EU control over large parts of our law-making.The sad fact about the position the Government is now in is that it was advised to “chuck Chequers” and pursue an alternative course of free and open trade.However, this is not the moment to cower and compromise further.Salzburg should mark the moment when we decide as a country to press ahead with taking back full control over our destiny.Our generous overtures of a £40billion orce payment, remaining an EU rule taker and compromise have been spurned and the EU is resorting to insults.So it’s time the Government realised this and “got real” on Brexit.Britain must take back control of these negotiations and send the EU a signal it will understand loud and clear.We must take the £40billion off the table and remind the EU there are serious consequences to their appalling behaviour and this will hit them hard.If they want to negotiate then we should offer them a take-it-or-leave-it, Canada-plus-style free trade deal, which is an economic prize for the UK and our trading partners.We leave the EU in six months and instead of wasting time accommodating its belligerent attitude, now is the time to unite the nation, believe in Britain and let the EU know that Brexit really does mean Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until now, Jezza — a staunch Bennite eurosceptic — has resisted any move to overturn Brexit. Yesterday, in a remarkable U-turn, he vowed to accept whatever delegates say.So abject surrender to the mob is the price he will pay to destroy Theresa May. “I enjoy being leader,” he said yesterday. “I am carrying on as leader of the Labour Party because I want to win an election.”His persistence in the face of scathing personal ratings is the only glint of sunlight for stricken Tories.Under any other leader, even snooty wannabe Emily Thornberry, Labour would be miles ahead.But we have learned not to underestimate Corbyn.The People’s Vote movement probably has the numbers in Parliament to vote down any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels.These so-called “moderates”, including the slippery Peter Mandelson, leadership flop David Miliband and decrepit Vince Cable, should be careful what they wish for.In normal times, the Tories would beat off the Momentum marauders. But for all her brave talk in Downing Street last week, Mrs May is a real political liability.She destroyed both her credibility and her majority in last year’s unforced contest.The public mood on Brexit is volatile and unpredictable.Most people believe the majority for Brexit, fuelled by EU arrogance and plain bad manners, could actually grow. But nobody’s sure.A snap election would focus the public’s attention on the choice between a clean break and a botched compromise which will never be acceptable to all sides.It could cauterise the issue which still ides families and friends. Or it could backfire badly.Tory Brexiteers must think hard before pulling the plug on the Maybot. It could split their party asunder.But so could Jeremy Corbyn’s rank opportunism.Blairite Labour moderates must soon choose.If they help Jeremy Corbyn win a vote of no confidence, what do they do next?Will they campaign for a party whose rampant extremists wish them dead? Will they stay silent while Momentum activists unseat their moderate comrades?Can deputy Tom Watson support a leader whose own MPs need round-the-clock armed guards against his dangerously fanatical supporters?Can they ignore threats of rape and torture? Nothing is too extreme or too petty for these thugs. They even want ex-Labour luvvie Maureen Lipman sacked from Corrie for attacking their Beloved Leader.Anyone who thinks images of Marxist anarchy are far-fetched should listen to Corbyn sidekick Dawn Butler praising the 1980s Militant Tendency — the forerunner to Momentum — which almost bankrupted Merseyside.“We are in Liverpool where over 30 years ago the council stood up to Thatcher and said, better to break the law than break the poor,” she ranted.That was when Labour split asunder for the first time, creating a new Social Democrat party which posed a short-lived threat the Tories.Roy Hattersley, deputy leader in those turbulent times, warns the party could split again today. “All we need is for one of the hard-working, long-suffering MPs to be kicked out and the whole thing will blow up in our faces,” he said yesterday.The Tories just need to be patient.Albanian drug gangs are gaining market share from Bulgarians, Romanians and Colombians by slashing cocaine prices.Police arrested a record 4,000 peddlers operating across county lines, mostly too young to charge.Kne crime among Somalis, Eritreans and Nigerians is soaring.Meanwhile, there’s a growth spurt in modern slavery.Organised crime is a multi-billion-pound industry affecting “more UK citizens, more often, than any other national security threat,” says the National Crime Agency.All despite Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Deal, or no dough.LABOUR’S position on Brexit is clear as mud, but we know one thing they do believe: the Press needs muzzling.From the moment Jeremy Corbyn told us that “change is coming”, the media has come under attack after attack from a leader who is playing the man — not the ball — when it comes to those asking him legitimate questions.Union strongman Len McCluskey accused the media of “vicious attacks” on the Labour Party.But it’s not an “attack” to ask Corbyn, a man who wants to be PM, why he spent his holidays visiting a terrorists’ cemetery in Tunisia or why he invited the IRA for tea and treats in Parliament.Nor is it just the tactics of the hated “mainstream media” to ask John McDonnell whether his extremist economics will actually work in the real world..Today’s announcement on employee ownership appears appealing for workers, but it would only hit investment and productivity in the long-term.If this Labour Party gains power, the free Press — and the economy — would be in serious danger.IS Anthony Joshua now the UK’s most impressive sportsman?His win over Alexander Povetkin at a packed-out Wembley was stunning.It’s now on to Fury and Wilder.Beat those two, and he might go down as Britain’s best ever boxer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The brain scores of people who did physical activity like swimming and running for 150 minutes a week performed better.Over time, the brain begins to shrink, causing memory failure and personality changes.Dementia is the leading cause of UK deaths and the only one in the top ten without a treatment to prevent, cure or slow it.Its cost to the nation is set to more than double to £55billion over the next 25 years as better treatment for other illnesses leads to longer lespans.A DAILY ten-minute walk may help ward off dementia, say experts.A Calornian study using MRI brain scans found that even mild exercise boosted the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for storing memories.“It’s one of the first regions to deteriorate as we get older — and much more severely in Alzheimer’s disease,” said research co-leader Prof Michael Yassa.It comes as a separate German study showed that 150 minutes of exercise a week can stave off the symptoms of Alzheimer’s.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So we will have to move on from Chequers  there is no movement from Barnier in two weeks.”Mrs May  left the Salzburg update to the very end of the  two-hour meeting, which had already overrun.One minister said: “We just wanted to get out by then.”During her pitch, Mrs May told them that “a critical point” was always going to come in the negotiations. But she implored: “Now is the time to hold our nerve”.The PM was backed by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab straight after the meeting, who dubbed it “a good, healthy discussion”.He added: “The Prime Minister made clear we are going to keep our calm and press the EU on some of the criticisms  they have made. But also to be clear that there are no credible alternatives  the EU has come up with.”Over the weekend, Mr Raab joined Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to cast doubt on the Chequers plan by suggesting there are alternatives.\" data-credit=\"\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-img=\"https:www.thesun/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/b5.jpg?strip=all\u0026ampw=817\" height=\"519\" width=\"817\"/4Over the weekend, Mr Raab joined Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to cast doubt on the Chequers plan by suggesting there are alternativesSources close to Mr Hunt yesterday said he has “intellectual sympathy” with a Canada-style free trade deal.But No10 insists the Cabinet has always fully backed Chequers “and that continues to be the case”.Downing Street also made it clear that the PM was expecting the EU to come up with a solution to the deadlock by the next  summit on October 18.Her official spokesman said: “We are now waiting for the EU to evolve its position.”TWO thirds of Brexit voters just want to leave the EU and do not care how.A poll found 66 per cent who backed Leave are “not interested in the details and just want those responsible to get on with it”.The ORB poll of 2,000 found 82 per cent  are “fed up with some pro-Brexit and pro-Remain politicians claiming they speak for everyone who voted in the referendum”.The poll was commissioned by the Brexit Delivery Group, Tory backbenchers pushing for a softer Brexit.Leader Simon Hart said: “This shows voters are much more realistic and pragmatic than MPs. It’s time to put ideology to one side and listen.”But  pro-EU Tory MPs  stepped up their calls for an alternative Brexit plan at the same time as hardline Brexiteer Tories did. Mrs May’s former policy chief George Freeman joined ex-minister Nick Boles to call for Britain to be part of the European Free Trade association  so it can keep single market access.Mr Freeman said: “There’s a Brexit solution waiting on the shelf.

Lower skilled workers will be granted entry in areas where there are serious labour market shortages that have not been able to be filled from the domestic market – such as in hospitality and construction.The Cabinet victory for Mr Javid was dubbed “a slam dunk” last night, after he won earlier support from the PM for it. Chancellor Philip Hammond made a plea for the Cabinet to give the new system more thought before they made a decision, but he was rebuffed.Business Secretary Greg Clark also insisted on the need to be flexible with Brussels during a long discussion yesterday afternoon.But a Cabinet source said: “There was a little bit of grumbling from the usual suspects, Philip and Greg, but they folded pretty quickly. It was a very well executed operation by Sajid, as he had all the facts on his side.”Mr Javid’s plan was boosted by a presentation to Cabinet yesterday by the chair of the independent Migration Advisory Committee, Professor Alan Manning. The LSE professor repeated his findings from a landmark, year-long report last week that there was little need for low skilled immigration to the UK.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey was also said to have taken a dig at Mr Hammond during the No10 meeting.The Sun was told that passionate Brexiteer Ms McVey said to the table: “We’re told by some people that we’re going to have a recession when we leave, and at the same time that we need mass immigration to keep the economy afloat. They can’t both be correct”.Downing Street is keeping the Cabinet’s formal conclusions under wraps so that she can unveil them in her speech to Tory conference next week.But in a strong hint at what we decided, a No10 spokesman said last night: “Cabinet today received a presentation from Migration Advisory Committee chairman Professor Alan Manning.“Cabinet was told by Professor Manning that the MAC was recommending that, in the post-Brexit immigration system, EEA and non-EEA nationals should be part of one universal system.“A key conclusion was that high skilled migration is of greater economic benefit than lower skilled migration, and as such the MAC recommended that the new system should make it easier for higher skilled than lower skilled workers to come to the UK.“The Cabinet agreed that, once free movement is brought to an end, the Government will be able to introduce a new system which works in the best interests of the United Kingdom – including by helping to boost productivity.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That seventh ping is almost exactly where the plane is.The northern corridor runs from southern China to Uzbekistan – a zone which spans over 1,400 miles – while the southern arc runs through the Indian Ocean where parts of the plane have been found.Wilsons images from Google Maps show the outline of a large plane in a remote part of southern Cambodia  – which could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.Following the Brits revelation, and with a £53million finders fee up for grabs, a group of experts hired a helicopter to scour the area highlighted by Wilson.However, on September 13, it was reported that the group had failed to find anything in the zone where Wilson believes the plane crashed.The Chinese government also used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area of the south east Asian country.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft.In a tweet, Space View wrote: “Stakeholders and bystanders plead Space View to shoot at the site.So we found out three images, shot in 2015, 2016 and 2018 from our archive.Sorry, no plane

below the surface, is about 330ft long and 165ft wide.Project director Jorge Freire told Reuters that the wreck was very well-preserved.He said: From a heritage perspective, this is the discovery of the decade.“[It’s] the most important find of all time [for the country].”Finding wrecks off the Portuguese coast is very rare, especially when the objects are this well preserved.The teams say the discovery will shed light on both Portugal’s trading past and Cascais’ place within it.Freire added: “We found the ship on September 4 using a geophysical survey and ers, and spent four days working on the site.”The ship was found while dredging the mouth of the Tagus river, which runs past the resort town and through Lisbon.The mayor of Cascais Carlos Carreiras described the discovery as one of the most signicant archaeological finds of the past decade, the  reported.He said that although the cargo ship had yet to be identied, it could prove signicant to the town.The mayor said: “It’s an extraordinary discovery that allows us to know more about our history, reinforcing our collective identity and shared values.“That, in turn, will certainly make us more attractive and competitive.”In 1994, the wreck of Portuguese ship Our Lady of the Martyrs was discovered near Fort of Sao Juliao da Barra, a military defence complex near Cascais.Our Lady of the Martyrs also sailed the spice route

ticket, she let her son ride alone after he repeatedly nagged her about it, with staff members reportedly allowing the oversight.As the boy’s car, number 18, reached the peak of the city landmark Ferris wheel, screams were heard from the ground as witnesses spotted the boy climbing out the window feet first.The shouting and screaming increased in intensity as the boy’s small body appeared to slip out the window between the metal security bars.Footage shows the boy desperately kicking his legs as he hangs by his neck, with no one in his car to help him back inside.When it became clear that the boy could not be helped, operators let the Ferris wheel continue to turn and waited as car 18 made its way to the ground agonisingly slowly.Staff members and other witnesses immediately rushed to the boy and freed him from the bars when he came within reach, the video shows.He and his mum were taken to the city’s First People’s Hospital, with the child fortunately suffering no serious injuries

ruling United Russia were beaten badly in a pair of regional votes by the crackpot Liberal Democratic Party of Russia .The shock results come amid widespread anger over the government plan to increase the national retirement age.In the far east region of Khabarovsk, the LDPR won the governor’s seat with a massive 70 per cent of the vote while the Putin-backed candidate received just under 28 per cent.The anti-western party also scored an upset in the run-off election for governor of the Vladimir region near Moscow, beating United Russia by more than 20 per cent.Bizarrely in that race, the LDPR candidate Vladimir Sipyagin won despite barely campaigning – such is the growing animosity towards Putin’s regime, reports The Times.The LDPR is led by the eccentric Vladimir Zhirinovsky – described widely as the “clown prince” of Russian politics.In the past, the 72-year-old has urged Putin to drop nuclear bombs on the US-backed Baltic countries and Turkey, with whom Russia has clashed with over the Syrian conflict.During his 1993 presidential election campaign Zhirinovsky pledged to provide free vodka, better lingerie for women and legalise polygamy.He also promised to clone famous Russians such as composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky.In an example of his anti-western rhetoric, Zhirinovsky once threatened to change the gravitational field of the Earth in order to sink the United States of America, reports Vice.In the tirade against the invasion of Iraq in 2002, he called the US a “second-hand goods store” filled with “c**ksuckers, handj*****s, and f***ers.”In 2006, following the poisoning death of Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko in London, Zhirinovsky said: Any traitor must be eliminated using any methods.If you have joined the special services to work, then you should work, but to betray, to run away abroad, to give up the secrets you learned while working – all of this looks bad.Activist and Putin critic Ilya Yashin said the LDPR’s success is directly related to the electorate’s anger towards the government.He said: “People want to get rid of United Russia so badly that they are ready to vote for the representative of a party of clowns.“The people are fed up.”Earlier this month, Zhirinovsky was filmed punching a man in the face at a packed political rally in Moscow.In video footage of the incident, the party leader is heard shouting at a young man: I will punch you and you will bleed” before attacking him.The victim had reportedly called the controversial MP a s***.Zhirinovsky’s son Igor Lebedev, who is an MP for the LDPR, has openly supported the country’s football hooligans in the past.Following the violent scenes at matches involving Russian thugs during Euro 2016, Lebedev said: “I don’t see anything wrong with the fans fighting. Quite the opposite: well done our lads, keep it up!”He made the astonishing remarks while being a member of the Russian Football Union executive committee.According to the FT, he later said: “I don’t think our fans did anything over the top, and you need to understand that, nine times out of 10, football supporters come to a game to fight, and that’s normal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"female dentist bombarded woman medic love letters","story":"Cosmetic dentist Daniella Todorova-Besarbova, 52, was married and had never had a lesbian relationship when she allegedly became fixated with the medic.Cheltenham Magistrates Court heard a stash of pictures of the medic was found on her computer and she had been researching stalking laws when she was arrested.Todorova-Besarbova, from Gloucester, was set to face a two-day trial after pleading not guilty to stalking the married woman, causing her serious alarm or distress.But as the trial was set to begin, the prosecution offered not to proceed with the case when the defendant agreed to accept an indefinite restraining order banning her from contacting her alleged victim.Todorova-Besarbova was told by the magistrates: You cannot make someone elses le a misery again.She replied: I understand.The court was told the stalking campaign lasted for nearly two years, between December 2015 and September 2017.Prosecuting, Matthew Jackson said the pair met professionally in 2014 but Todorova-Besarbova began to pester the medic after she refused to go for a coffee with her.He said: A Facebook friends request then appeared from the defendant to the complainant. Several Facebook messages were also sent by the defendant.On 28th April 2016 the defendant told the complainant she was going back to Bulgaria to get a orce. She asked questions about [the medics] personal le, whether she was happy, etc.She again asked her to go for a coffee with her and this was again declined.Mr Jackson said Todorova-Besarbova saw the medic again on May 13, 2016 and produced a love letter which she handed over for the complainants consideration.The court heard in the letter she said she had agreed orce terms with her husband and would be free in three months, adding I will wait for you.The dentist was said to have written: You are the only person I have ever wanted to spend my le with. I have never been in love with a woman before. You are the first in my le. Love Daniella.The court was told Todorova-Besarbova also sat outside the medics workplace for hours at a time and turned up outside her home address on a number of occasions.Mr Matthews said the complainant had made a statement saying she felt extremely shocked and disturbed when Todorova-Besarbova first professed her love for her.A statement read to the court from the alleged victim, said: I have had nightmares, including one about finding the defendant in my home.I still do not understand what led her to fixate on me.

Its out of range and probably distressed. People rushing to the site in boats or with drones will only disturb the whale and cause it more distress.If you wish to see the whale for yourself, stay on the shore and do not get in the water.The last time a whale was spotted in the River Thames was a bottlenose whale, now known as the River Thames Whale.In January 2006 a female northern bottlenose whale swam up the Thames and caused hysteria in London.She sadly died during a rescue mission near Battersea.A spokesperson for Whale and Dolphin Conservation said: Belugas are High Arctic species and this one is thousands of miles from where it should be! Belugas are usually associated close to the ice in places like Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea.He or she is obviously very lost and quite possibly in trouble. There are a few reports of belugas in the UK in recent years.In the summer of 2015 two were spotted off the Northumberland coast and one in Northern Ireland.

I cant believe it.Ben Rosser, 36, a former police officer who founded The Pythian Club, an organisation trying to steer young people away from kne crime, said: “Big businesses are all about making money. They need to be held accountable and take responsibility.It maybe Halloween but we are in the midst of a kne crime crisis where young people are dying daily and it is not responsible to be promoting any type of kne.There are a lot of other things you can buy on Halloween that is not kne related. It is shocking.Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie added: Were long past the point where any shops should be retailing knives to children, replica or not.Carrying knives without just cause needs to end and it does not help  we see this culture encouraged or made light of. I hope this retailer will think again.Patrick Green, of The Ben Kinsella Trust, told The Sun Online: With a growing number of families losing loved one to kne crime over the last 3 years, Poundlands decision to stock and sell these plastic kne is insensitive and hurtful.We know that these toys are not illegal and they are not breaking any laws but I would ask them to reconsider their policy on stocking these knives given the current epidemic of kne crime.Families who have lost loved ones and victims who have been injured by kne crime will find it impossible to understand why Poundland would want to sell these knives to children.By do doing so they risk giving a dangerous message to children that carrying a kne is a normal or exciting thing to do. We implore Poundland to stop their sale immediately.But Poundland defended its right to sell the replica knives.A spokesman for the company said: We share their concern on kne crime.“That’s why no-one is doing more than Poundland.By the end of this month well be the only high street retailer to completely remove kitchen knives from all of our stores nationwide.“This, however, is just a glow-in-the-dark yellow plastic toy for Halloween."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436702360.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"london commuters you really dont want to end up next to on the tube","story":"More than a billion people descend on the capitals Tube system every year.And because theres just so many dferent people on board, some of them are not going to make the best travel companions.From nightmarish costumes to being too drunk to sit, theres an endless list of ways in which people can ensure that they are unbearable to be around in a cramped carriage.Of course, some people arent even aware that theyre derailing their fellow commuters days.But there are definitely some who just cant resist railing against regularity.Weve put together a gallery of some of the weird and wonderful people  that you do not want to end up sitting next to."},{"url":null,"title":"twitter funniest celebrity double barreled surname","story":"Richard K Herring took to Twitter to make the strange request after a fan suggested he marry someone with the last name Bone - to make the surname Herring-Bone.Herring then tweeted: Which two celebrities would you like to see get married to create an amusing double-barrelled name and the hilarious responses started flooding in.Some Twitter users opted for innocent rhyming or funny-sounding combinations, while others went down a route less safe for work with filthy puns.Responses on Twitter included actress Liz Hurley and ex-footballer Craig Burley - to make Hurley-Burley.While another joker suggest a combination of South African Anglican cleric Desmond Tutu and Canadian singer Shania Twain.Another tongue twister was Sven Goran-Erikssens ex-girlfriend Nancy DellOlio and ex-England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio.\" data-credit=\"\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-img=\"https:www.thesun/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AF-COMPOSITE-CELEB-NAMES-1.jpg?strip=all\u0026ampw=750\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"/1 \" data-credit=\"\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-img=\"https:www.thesun/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AF-COMPOSITE-CELEB-NAMES-4.jpg?strip=all\u0026ampw=750\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"/1 \" data-credit=\"\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-img=\"https:www.thesun/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AF-COMPOSITE-CELEB-NAMES-2.jpg?strip=all\u0026ampw=750\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"/1 \" data-credit=\"\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-img=\"https:www.thesun/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AF-COMPOSITE-CELEB-NAMES-3.jpg?strip=all\u0026ampw=750\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"/1Other popular suggestions paired singer Beyonce and  jazz musician Roy Castle, actor Danny Dyer and musician Chris Rea, fashion designer Vera Wang and author Stephen King, playwright Edward Albee and composer Bach.Musician Mark Ronson and athlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson were matched, as were artist Tracey Emin and badminton player Gail Emms and politician Jack Straw and Bake-Off star Mary Berry.Herring is an English stand-up comedian, comedy writer, podcaster and diarist.He was one half of the double act Lee and Herring alongside comedian Stewart Lee have been on the television and radio together since the 1980s.Herring has also produced four plays written eight books."},{"url":null,"title":"earth is wobbling worse than ever and humans are partly to blame nasa reveals","story":"Experts at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Calornia have tracked changed over the entire 20th century to explore what is scientically known as “polar motion”.The Earth is not like the globes you may find sitting on a desk. It is not a perfect sphere and doesn’t rotate smoothly while it spins – instead it drts and wobbles.NASA have broken down the three main reasons for this, the first being ‘glacial rebound’.This happens when glaciers cover a larger area that causes the planet to be squeezed and bulge at the end of the ice.As they melt the bulging changes shape and redistributes the Earth’s mass. Although this last happened 26,000 years ago the planet is still slowly changing shape.The second reason is what scientists call ‘mantle convection’.This theory is similar to the ice one that says the shting is due to large rocks in the Earths core moving over each other and making the planet wobble.The third and final one is human influence. NASA says this is that of a rapidly warming environment thanks to climate change.Greenland’s ice caps melting saw 7,500 gigatons of ice drt into the ocean. This weight change could have contributed to the wobble.Eric Ivins of JPL said: “There is a geometrical effect that  you have a mass that is 45 degrees from the North Pole – which Greenland is – or the South Pole , it will have a bigger impact on shting Earth’s spin axis than a mass that is right near the pole.”NASA think there are three contributing reasons behind the Earth wobbling. They are as follows...The wobble does not pose a major threat to le. It does, however, create challenges for navigation.But technology can compensate for our wobbly planet.

Second vote campaigners say the Prime Minister\u0027s Chequers plan, now being attacked by Remainers as well as Leavers, was not on the ballot paper in 2016 and that therefore voters should be given the option to reconsider what is now on offer.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-corbyn-interview-brexit_4433222.jpg?20180925165338 ","title":"jeremy corbyn backs sir keir starmer over not ruling out remain at labour conference","story":"Asked  Brexit was going to happen in March 2019, he said: \"At the moment it looks like it and we will challenge this government on the six tests.\"If they don\u0027t meet them then we will vote against it.\"The government would then have to go back to the European Union and continue negotiations, or they might choose to resign and have a general election so that the people of this country can decide who they want to conduct these negotiations.\"Asked  Brexit was going to happen at all, Mr Corbyn said: \"Well look, we will challenge the government\u0027s terms for Brexit  they don\u0027t meet out six tests.\"We are not in the majority in parliament.\"If we were, we wouldn\u0027t be in the mess we\u0027re in at that moment.\"     The Brexit issue has dominated the conference, amid calls for Mr Corbyn to come out in favour of a second referendum.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-jeremy-corbyn-michel-barnier_4432754.jpg?20180925095540 ","title":"jeremy corbyn would be incompetent brexit negotiator poll","story":"The figure was slightly more positive for Labour when asked  the party would be competent in striking a deal with Brussels.A quarter of people - 25% - agreed Labour would be competent, while 68% said it would be incompetent.

They argue a deal seeking to replicate the existing Canada model would give the UK greater scope to erge from EU rules and that additional friction at borders could be minimised through trusted trader schemes, product bar coding and other non-border checks.Both Mr Davis and Mr Rees-Mogg claim the EU negotiating team has already offered this model as an option for the UK, but Downing Street says such an offer would require the so-called \u0027Irish backstop\u0027 agreed last December to come into effect.Although the UK government is trying to reformulate the backstop proposal, the current wording would require Northern Ireland to remain in the customs union and the single market, separating it off from the rest of the UK by creating a customs border in the Irish Sea - something the prime minister has said she will never accept.

In a barnstorming conference speech in Liverpool, she warned members that  they “truly want to ... unite the human race and re-unite our country, then again we must start with uniting our own party”. She demanded an end to the “pointless conflicts which ide our movement, which poison our online debate, and which distract us from fighting the Tories”.  Warning activists not to use support for Palestinians as a cloak for anti-Semitism, emotional Ms Thornberry said: “Let me speak to you from the depths of my heart and my soul and say something I never thought I’d have to say in my letime as a Labour member and activist, and it is simply this - that  we want to root out fascism and racism and hatred from our world, and from our country, then we must start - we must start - with rooting it out of our own party. “We all support the Palestinian cause, we are all committed to recognise the Palestinian State, and I stand here with no hesitation when I condemn the Netanyahu government for its racist policies and its criminal actions against the Palestinian people.  “But I know as well, and we must all acknowledge, that there are sickening iniduals on the fringes of our movement, who use our legitimate support for Palestine as a cloak and a cover for their despicable hatred of Jewish people, and their desire to see Israel destroyed. “Those people stand for everything that we have always stood against and they must be kicked out of our party the same way Oswald Mosley was kicked out of Liverpool.”     Labour\u0027s summer was overshadowed by claims of anti-Semitism after the party initially failed to adopt internationally-recognised examples of abuse.

The Shadow Chancellor said all the messages we\u0027re getting are that the entire system needs replacing. He spoke out after Labour\u0027s welfare chief Margaret Greenwood told the Mirror she was keeping the option open of scrapping the entire eight-year shake-up. Labour - whose current policy is only to pause and fix UC - is launching a review of the entire benefits system, top to bottom, to report back this time next year. It will include Universal Credit, which rolls six benefits into one supposedly to make work pay - but has left families destitute due to cuts.  Mr McDonnell faced demands to scrap the entire multi-billion-pound benefit today during a fringe event at the Labour Party Conference.   He replied: Margaret in doing the review will obviously come forward with conclusions about Universal Credit itself. But all the messages we\u0027re getting at the moment are that this is a system that just doesn\u0027t work, won\u0027t work, and not only needs reform but needs replacing. And that\u0027s the debate we will have as we go forward. Jane Aitchison, Labour\u0027s candidate for Pudsey, said she had worked for 26 years in the Department for Work and Pensions - where she was a senior union rep. She demanded Universal Credit is scrapped.  For the first 20 years I enjoyed my job a lot, I enjoyed helping people. she said. Since austerity came in I have to say I\u0027ve found I get very little job satisfaction on either front, and particularly on the work front. Most of my colleagues hate their job now and find it really depressing. We hate sanctions, we hate disability benefits, we hate the hostile environment and the way we have to treat the customer. And it\u0027s causing a lot of staff to just leave.

But six months out from Brexit day it\u0027s looking more and more likely that we won\u0027t get a deal at all. And by the looks of these warnings from the government, that\u0027s going to mean a head-scratching mess of hassle, faff and red tape. Tory ministers today published their final pile of 24 papers, showing what will change for British businesses and consumers in the unlikely event of a no-deal outcome. It could cause havoc with flights and coach journeys and create a massive headache for truck drivers. And taking your pet abroad could mean a visit to the vet FOUR MONTHS ahead of time. Here are the most startling warnings from the final tranche of no-deal Brexit warnings, and what they could mean for you. 1. Taking your pet abroad? You could need to visit the vet four months in advance  The papers reveal a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. Currently, the main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least FOUR MONTHS before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on 30 March 2019 would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November 2018, the papers warn. The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least 30 days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than 10 days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  British airlines hoping to fly planes between the bloc and the UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the latest Brexit technical notices said. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. The notice says: “In this scenario the UK would envisage granting permission to EU airlines to continue to operate. “We would expect EU countries to reciprocate in turn. “It would not be in the interest of any EU country or the UK to restrict the choice of destinations that could be served, though  such permissions are not granted, there could be disruption to some flights.” UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. 3. Planes might be grounded  they fail new safety checks  Planes issued with safety certicates in the UK could be grounded  European officials fail to recognise the accreditation, under a no-deal Brexit. EU officials could decide not to allow British pilots and aircraft certied by the UK\u0027s Civil Aviation Authority to operate in EU skies. Britain has said it would continue to recognise licences and certicated authorised by the Eureopan Aviation Safety Agency. But the technical notice says: “The EU has indicated that it would take a dferent approach to the UK. The information notices issued by the European Commission say that certicates previously issued by the before exit day would no longer be automatically accepted in the system after 29 March 2019.” Pilots and firms hoping to operate in the EU should consult the bloc, the note adds.  Qualications issued by CAA-approved organisations “would no longer be valid for use with EU operators after exit day”, the document warns. UK firms could also be shut out of maintenance contracts and supplying aircraft parts. 5. You might have to go through airport security TWICE  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport before changing flights for an onward destination would be screened in Britain as now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says the Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” 6. Truck drivers will need new permits - and there almost certainly won\u0027t be enough to go around  Thousands of truck drivers could be locked out of EU countries as their permits to carry freight across the continent become null and void. If there\u0027s a No Deal Brexit, UK hauliers will no longer have the automatic right to be let through EU nations\u0027 borders under the current permit system. Instead,  no other deal comes into force, they have to apply for an \u0027ECMT\u0027 permit - and there are only a set number of these available per year. For one type of these annual permits, just 984 are issued per year, the documents say. The no deal papers warn explicitly that demand for the permits will signicantly exceed supply and firms should prepare for getting fewer than they ask for. They will be allocated through a formula that was laid down in law earlier this year, and successful applicants will be contacted at the end of 2018. Haulage firms have been warned by the government to draw up contingency plans for  they end up unable to use some of their fleet. 7. Car insurance will get more complicated  Hauliers and holidaymakers driving to the EU will be forced to apply for a \u0027green card\u0027 to prove they have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting.  Meat and animal product imports from the EU, but which originate outside the EU, would be subject to additional checking at Border Inspection Posts. The government says staff will be trained to “minimise the impact” of the increased number of import checks, and “reduce the chance of delays.” 9.

A conservation expert said the appearance of the whale is very, very unusual and said there could be a number of reasons for its arrival. The British Divers Marine Le Rescue  team, dedicated to rescuing marine animals in distress around the UK, are monitoring the situation and sending a representative to the scene - although the whale has not been spotted for around 45 minutes.  Lucy Babey, head of science and conservation at ORCA, said: This is the most southerly sighting of a beluga we have ever seen around these shores. The last sighting in UK waters was in 2015 when they were spotted near the Northumberland coastline, but they left shortly afterwards. Belugas usually travel in pods but this creature could have separated for a number of reasons. It\u0027s possible that the animal could be disorientated after becoming unwell. Storms or environmental disturbances may also have contributed.  Dave Andrews posted footage online showing the creature popping out of the water a number of times. He says he spotted the whale off Coalhouse Fort in East Tilbury, Essex, as it hunted food around barges east of London. Mr Andrews wrote online that he had been watching the whale for a few hours, and it was still swimming in the river on Tuesday afternoon. But experts expressed concerns for the whale\u0027s health, telling people to give it space.  Marine le rescuers said a beluga whale almost certainly entered the Thames, and they urged the public to keep their distance for its own safety, the BBC reported. The RSPCA statement read: “The RSPCA is aware of reports of a whale - possibly a beluga - in the Thames. We are working with other agencies to monitor the situation and ready to provide appropriate assistance  requested.” Mr Andrews tweeted: Can\u0027t believe I\u0027m writing this, no joke - BELUGA in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort. For anyone twitching the #BELUGA its been feeding around the barges  for the last hour and hasn\u0027t moved more than 200m in either direction. Still present.    Norfolk-based Mr Andrews is a consultant ecologist and ornithologist, according to his Twitter profile. Tanya Ferry, environment manager at the Port of London Authority which is monitoring the whale, said it was unclear what the whale could eat, reports the BBC. If they are eating things like jellyfish, we don\u0027t tend to have a great deal of jellyfish in the Thames, but we do have quite a lot of plastic bags, which could be quite an issue, she said. We\u0027re hoping  we give it enough space and keep an eye on it, it will find its own way out of the Thames to an environment that\u0027s more appropriate for it. We certainly don\u0027t want people trying to rescue it. Beluga whales are commonly found in the Arctic Ocean, where they feed on fish and crustaceans, but have been known to migrate south to warmer waters. In August and September 2015, Sea Watch Foundation reported beluga whale sightings off the coast of Northumberland and Tyne and Wear. Rare Bird Alert tweeted: Beluga Whale in the #thames today! Live updates available on our app as and when we get them.    One Twitter user commented: Almost unbelievably, it would seem that there is currently a beluga whale in the Thames! A beluga whale sighting in the Thames is extraordinarily rare. Tuesday\u0027s sighting sparked concerns for the creature\u0027s health.

The Leicester-based firm produces 11 million packets a day and by 2025, 28 billion will have been added to landfill. Geraint Ashcroft, of Pontypridd, Wales, started the petition with campaign group 38 Degrees. The 61-year-old said: “Manufacturing giants like Walkers need to do their bit.”   Cathy Warren, campaigner at 38 Degrees, said: “There’s huge public concern about the amount of plastic being produced, and that means it’s crunch time for Walkers to decide  they will listen to their customers. “Their promise to deal with plastic crisp packets by 2025 is woefully inadequate. By that time, they will have produced a breathtaking amount of plastic waste without paying a penny to clean it up.

Nigel Hurst, who survived kidney cancer despite being given 12 months to live 15 years ago, tragically took his own le after one missed council tax bill grew to \u0026pound1,500 and then spiralled out of control. He wrote a suicide note to his children hours before bailfs were due to evict him and repossess his house, which he had been living in without heating or water as he could not afford it. And he posted on Facebook: Goodnight sweet world. Daughter Jessica Hurst had been scrolling through her feed during a break from opera rehearsal when she saw the message from father Nigel and paused. She thought it was odd and commented Have you been hacked? Lol and went back to practise. However, hours later when she checked her phone again she saw missed calls from her mother and grandmother. She rang her mum back, who told her: Your dad\u0027s gone.  Jessica, 25, collapsed onto the floor. Her 56-year-old father, who lived in Lindale, Cumbria, had killed himself as could no longer go on. He had left notes in the house, including one at the bottom of the stairs for the bailfs telling them which room he was in. Nigel also left letters for daughters Jessica and Sally, 20. They had no idea of the extent of his money troubles as he had hidden it from them. Jessica bravely shared the note in a plea for more humanity from debt collectors. “It breaks my heart to write this. I love you with all my heart, wrote Nigel, who loved the community he lived in and would organise events such as bonfires and barbecues. I have been so unhappy in my personal le for so long, I cannot go on. Now I am about to lose my house as well as my self respect, I have decided to go.” He added: “Do not grieve for me for long. Passing for me will be a huge relief. I love you both and will always be with you.” Now Jessica is speaking out to highlight her dad\u0027s tragic case as she also wants to help others. She said: No young person should be left without their father because of a few thousand pounds of debt.  Recalling the moment she visited her father\u0027s house following his death in October, Jessica was told by a bailf You\u0027ll be shocked, reports the BBC . Inside she found bankruptcy letters, court letters and other notices on table tops, kitchen surfaces and stuffed in plastic Co-op bags. She told the BBC: Until he died I hadn\u0027t realised my father had been in debt, let alone declared bankrupt. Three days earlier he had dropped me off in Glasgow and helped me move into a flat, ready to start the second year of my master\u0027s degree. He had stayed with me all day, helping me to unpack, and called me three times on his journey back home. It was the last time I saw him. She later found out that Nigel, who acted as an agony aunt to pals, had been living without water or heating as he could not afford it. Nigel\u0027s money problems began in 2008. It started off with \u0026pound1,500 debt owed for council tax to South Lakeland District Council. Over time it spiralled to \u0026pound72,000 due to interest, agent fees and legal costs. In total he owed more than \u0026pound9,300 to the council. He was also declared bankrupt. The rugby fan never disclosed his money problems to his daughters as he was a private man, and Jessica believes her father would have seen asking for help as being a failure.  A coroner in March ruled Nigel\u0027s death on October 4 was suicide. Jessica said: “This debt pushed my father in to taking his own le. It is utterly disgusting and inhumane. The amount of pressure that had put on him was unbearable. No human being was going to withstand that as well as having cancer. It is just not fair.” She added to the BBC: I understand that my dad didn\u0027t reply to the council\u0027s letters and that must have been frustrating. But  a client has been a good citizen, paid his council tax all his le and then suddenly stops, there must be something wrong. I believe that in those circumstances the council should try to reach out to that person. Jessica believes her father was failed by the council and thinks it should have done more to help him, rather than just continue to send letters. She says the first person to turn up to his house and talk about the money he owed was a bailf. The council says it did not have a telephone number for Nigel to talk to him. The debt has since been reduced, but student Jessica and her unemployed sister do not have the money to pay it and know their family home will be sold.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were guests at the wedding of Sophie Carter and Robert Snuggs in Norfolk , and Prince George and Princess Charlotte were on page boy and bridesmaid duties.  While Kate wasn\u0027t a bridesmaid, many believe she had an unofficial role on the special day - and they believe it was her outfit which gave it away. She wore her stunning blue Catherine Walker dress and matching coat, which she first donned during her tour of Germany in 2017, with a matching floral headband.  But it was the colour which caught people\u0027s attention, as it was almost identical to people in the wedding party. The groomsmen wore blue waistcoats and the page boys were in adorable blue trousers, which are bespoke from London-based Amaia Kids.  This could be a sign she was an unofficial maid-of-honour for Sophie, reports Hello! .  It wouldn\u0027t be the first time Kate has carried out the duty unofficially, and she wasn\u0027t maid-of-honour for her sister Pippa last year.  It\u0027s believed she didn\u0027t want to upstage her little sister on her big day, so spent her time looking after the little bridesmaids and page boys instead. Kate and Sophie are very close, and Sophie is one of Princess Charlotte\u0027s godmothers. They have been friends for many years, and have been photographed together at lots of dferent events including Christmas Day church services.

In the past she\u0027s been photographed wearing a woolly hat and carrying her yoga mat, and she also reportedly wears a baseball cap. Speaking previously to PEOPLE, a source said: When she does venture out to Pilates or to get her hair done, she normally goes incognito under a baseball cap.  The only other place she has visited regularly is Whole Foods, which is little more than five minutes away from Kensington Palace.

Clara Malagon, who had been struggling with self doubt and bouts of depression for some time, had been on-duty on the night of the atrocity. She witnessed first-hand horric injuries sustained by the young victims, but the 22-year-old successfully underwent counselling and had a detailed debrief about the bombing with senior doctors afterwards. However, in July last year just seven weeks after the tragedy, Miss Malagon was found hanged at her Manchester city centre apartment.  It is not known why she killed herself. An inquest this week heard Miss Malagon from Twickenham, south west London had completed a degree in nursing at Manchester University and became a critical care nurse at Manchester Royal Infirmary in 2016. She was a keen rower and enjoyed cycling, running and walking and also played the viola and took up ballet and flamenco dancing. But Miss Malagon also suffered bouts of depression and self doubt and had been prescribed the antidepressant Citallipram.  Her father Dr Ignacio Malagon, a consultant anaesthatist at Wythenshawe Hospital wept as he told the Manchester hearing: She was physically quite tough but she was seeing her GP for mental health issues - we talked about it regularly. She was good at taking instructions from her GP and we talked about counselling. Out of the blue she started crying at university, she would come to me but I couldn\u0027t give her professional advice so I advised her to go and talk to someone. She went to counselling organised by university - everything was going well so she came off the medication. But in January last year she started crying again, and she said to me \u0027Dad, I need help.\u0027 After she had been to the GP she was told it was going to be three months before she was going to get any counselling, she said she couldn\u0027t wait for three months and said she wanted to go private.  She found one counsellor but she didn\u0027t like them. We were talking about money and I offered to help her out. I gave her some money to pay for the first few sessions and she found one she did like. She was able to organise the counselling herself. She said she was happy with the lady she found. He added: Clara was a staff nurse but she had done a training course in intensive care. She was on duty in May last year during the Arena attack. It was traumatic for her and I rang her, I was in hospital too, and I said to her: \u0027Are you OK?\u0027 And she said: \u0027Yeah Dad, it\u0027s really tough, I\u0027ve seen some of the kids didn\u0027t make it.\u0027 We had a long chat and I said to her that I realise this is very traumatic for her and  she was upset then she should tell her seniors, or  she felt unwell she should tell her managers. I just said to her not to worry and that it was going to be fine.  A few days after there was a debriefing provided by the MRI. She rang me afterwards and said there had been 50 people there including her seniors and management. Everyone there told how wonderful the team had worked and she was delighted. We talked on a regular basis, either over a glass of wine or dinner. If she had an issue she would talk about it to me in a professional manner  it was to do with work. I was involved  she wanted to talk about anything. She would tell me about the patients she helped, she never said she felt understaffed or overworked. She shared everything with me. I had a very good relationship with my daughter.  When she felt stressed she would share it and talk with me. In the weeks leading up to her death, there were none such conversations. On the weekend before she was due to come for her dinner. She said she was on the train and she was very busy with things and she had been visiting a friend in London - there was no dference in her at all. Miss Malagon\u0027s flatmate Grace Callaghan who found her friend on her  home from work said: She had said to me she was feeling low and she made an appointment with her doctor to prescribe some more antidepressants. \u0027But that weekend we said we would have to have a curry night as we had not seen each other properly. She was one of the loveliest people I ever knew - on the night before there wasn\u0027t any concern about her. GP Dr Gill Aitken said Miss Malagon had been prescribed Citrallipram but in September 2016 she came off it and finished her nursing degree.  In a statement Dr Aitken said: She came back to me and said she was feeling low and crying, and feeling apathetic. Whilst there was no trigger, I believe this was work related. She was anxious about work, she had her own self doubt and confidence issues and she said she wasn\u0027t sleeping. But she denied any suicidal thoughts. She said she wanted some medication and I suggested a review in two weeks time, which she did. She said she had been back to Spain for a few weeks but she felt upset and felt guilty for not being a happy person to be around at the time. She had contacted a Manchester self help group. I asked  there were any issues at work and she said there had been some complex patients. She said she had no suicidal thoughts. She told me her family were a strong protective factor for her. I told her who to contact  she felt in crisis and said  she needed anything she could make an emergency appointment with the team.  Police examined Miss Malagon\u0027s iPad and laptop but found no evidence she would take her own le - with one message to a friend in a social media chat saying she had a successful counselling session. Recording a conclusion of suicide, Coroner Andrew Bridgman said: Clara had her full professional le ahead of her. Her father has told me that she was a fit and active young woman who had lots of hobbies. But it is clear from the evidence that she had mental health issues from around 2016 which correspond with her final year of her degree. She was on medication for around 6-7 months, to which she came off it and appeared to be fine. However this resurfaces towards mid June 2017 - three to four weeks following the Manchester Arena tragedy when she was on duty. It clearly had some effect on her however I have had a discussion with her father, and there was no specic reference to the trauma of the events of that night. She sought therapy and she did take private counselling, and found this helped her. Clara did intend to take her le but this inquest cannot answer why.

Quick-thinking Charlotte Ellett, 15, knew something was wrong when she ed home from school and found dad, Nick, 46, mumbling nonsense. Nick, who suffers from an unrelated heart condition, lay down after lunch feeling shivery and unwell. His we Aquilla took his temperature, but a faulty thermometer gave her a false low reading.  Charlotte, a St John Ambulance cadet in Northfleet, Kent, came home from school to find her father alarmingly unwell. Charlotte told : “I immediately picked up something was wrong. Mum was panicky, dad was sleeping and mumbling gibberish. When he woke up he asked for water but couldn’t hold the cup to drink. “His nails were blue and his lips were turning blue. “I checked his oxygen levels which were low, his heart rate was high even considering his heart condition, and I could tell his temperature was higher than the thermometer was reading.  “St John Ambulance taught me to rule out any other conditions, like heart attack or stroke. When you look behind the lines and add all the elements together you realise that this could be sepsis. “I told mum, ‘dad needs an ambulance now\u0027. “I had to persuade mum a bit because dad doesn’t like asking for help but she agreed to call an ambulance. “Sepsis had been in the news a lot and I knew it moved fast. You have to spot it quickly. When paramedics arrived Nick\u0027s temperature was more than 40 degrees and he was rushed under blue lights to hospital on May, 3 this year. He was treated for sepsis and a leg infection was later identied as the cause.  Nick said: “It’s astonishing what she did. I’m sure she would have done it for anyone, but she did it for me, her dad. Not everyone would be able to stay calm in a family situation like that I’m very grateful. When Charlotte came home from school that day she picked it up straight away and when the paramedics arrived she instinctively gave them the handover - like she\u0027d do at cadets - telling them my oxygen was down, I had lost strength, my temperature was higher than the thermometer reading. I\u0027m very proud of her. She\u0027s our angel. Her mum Aquilla added: “I definitely think Charlotte saved Nick’s le. By the next morning he may not have been with us  she hadn’t persuaded me to call an ambulance.” Charlotte, from Gravesend, plans to pursue a career in medicine, as a neurological consultant or a paramedic.  She was presented with the Guy Evans Young Hero Award at this year\u0027s St John Ambulance Everyday Heroes Awards. The award is presented in honour of Guy Evans, who sadly died from a heart arrhythmia at 17 years old when basic first aid skills may have helped save his le: The charity’s annual event recognises the outstanding bravery and first aid skills of iniduals and teams of people who stepped forward when it mattered most to help people, support communities, and have a positive impact on health. Charlotte said: “To win this award is amazing - I didn’t expect it at all. “When I saw my dad’s face flash up on screen to show that I had won I started crying. “Saving his le means everything to me, I love him and we’re very close. Sometimes it hits you that  I had not gone to St John’s and they had not trained me there he might not be here today. It’s scary to think about the ‘what s’.  The awards were hosted by celebrity vicar and one half of 80s band The Communards, The Reverend Richard Coles, who said: Tonight’s winners didn’t leave. “Instead, they stepped forward when others needed them most and their actions saved lives. “I have met people this evening who would not have survived without their timely interventions, and I am delighted to see these Everyday Heroes recognised by St John Ambulance for their bravery and dedication.” Other winners included 15-year-old army cadet Courtney Powdrill from Luton who went to the rescue of a young man being attacked by a group of youths with a large kne.  The youths ran away, leaving him bleeding on the ground and – without hesitating – Courtney used her St John Ambulance first aid training to apply pressure to a signicant leg wound and raised his legs to reduce blood loss. Fellow award winner Molly Harris was praised for her quick-thinking when her stepdad went into cardiac arrest. Army cadet Molly from North Devon calmly took control of the situation and performed CPR to keep him alive.  Father and son, Garry and Ellis, were also recognised for their le-saving actions winning the Community Hero award after cutting short their round of golf to run to the aid of a man who collapsed on the course. St John Ambulance’s Chief Executive, Martin-Houghton Brown congratulated the award winners and praised the work of St John Ambulance’s volunteers. “The achievements of our award nominees and winners are extraordinary and I have been overwhelmed by the stories of their everyday heroism in protecting le and health,” he said. “These Everyday Heroes have used their links to St John Ambulance to save lives whether that’s as our dedicated volunteers, through using skills they learned in our first aid training, or by working closely with our charity.

Londoners can pay \u0026pound15 an hour to catch some shut eye in small rooms made for relaxation and sleep.  Pop and Rest launched last year in the capital as a pop-up in Monument and following a surge in demand for rooms, a permanent base was set up in Shoreditch in June.  Inspired by Japanese capsule hotels, customers who usually work nearby, can have a short rest in one of the four pods .  Sometimes people don\u0027t prioritise sleep, it\u0027s seen as weak in the working environment, but that\u0027s wrong, says Mauricio Villamizar, co-founder of Pop and Rest. People are starting to realise how important sleep is for a good quality of le.  He says people from all walks of le have used the pods so far local office workers, backpackers, people who work hard and play hard, and new parents. It helps them get through the day  they\u0027ve only slept for a few hours the night before and have to get up for work. The rooms hold a single bed, desk and some plants, with dark walls, a lavender aroma, ear plugs and an eye mask to help with relaxation. The minimum booking time is for 30 minutes, which costs \u0026pound8. Snoozy customers can also reserve them for one hour at \u0026pound15, and two for \u0026pound28. Sleepers can choose to rely on their own alarm to wake them, or have someone knock on the door.  Villamizar, 28, and his Pop and Rest co-founder Yoann Demont came up with the idea after observing Londoners’ hectic lestyle and long working hours. The company currently attracts around 30 to 35 customers a week, many who are freelancers and those working in the gig industry. Villamizar says a nap can help you refocus and recharge to have more energy in the afternoon. He added: We want you to feel like you\u0027re at home, where you can relax and unwind.

The anonymous pre-school worker from Calornia took to Reddit to share the jaw-dropping story. Posting under the username HelpfulButterscotch2, they explained their shock at discovering the child was only being taught the Star Trek language and nothing else \u0027on purpose\u0027. The little boy is described as only knowing the most basic of words like \u0027yes\u0027, \u0027no\u0027 and \u0027juice\u0027. But according the minder at the nursery in the States, in the last month the boy has begun chatting away and his incredibly limited vocab has doubled.

I looked up a lot of languages and for the le of me could not identy it. The worker then claims to have asked bosses what the language was. They all suddenly got big smiles on their faces, they said. They explained to me in depth that the dad was a linguistics hobbyist who was trying to recreate an experiment where he raises his kid to speak a language from the TV show Star Trek.

Stephen Ringo weighed 29st at his heaviest after gorging on two Big Macs, two large fries, and two large cokes as well as 20 chicken nuggets every day for lunch, followed by a Domino\u0027s pizza for dinner. But after the collapse of his married it forced the 38-year-old to re-evaluate his health and he knew he had to make a change. Before he lost weight, Stephen, of Johnson City, Tennessee, was so large he struggled to put on his socks, and the extra pounds drove his sex drive “into the ground”.  The 5ft 7in IT expert said his body issues deeply affected his confidence and wore away at his marriage until he got orced in 2016. Stephen then began to curb his fast food addiction and ed to his power-lting roots in October 2016, shedding an incredible 16 stone in just two years. The super slimmer said: “It’s fair to say that my weight ruined my marriage. “It was the single biggest factor. “My relationship with my we deteriorated as my weight crept up. “I was depressed and as that set in intimacy kind of left. My weight drove my sex le into the ground.  “I believe my depression and lack of sex drive ultimately drove my we away from me. “If I had been a better husband I might have been able to pull the marriage back together. “My weight held me back from doing so many things. Getting dressed in the morning was tough. I could hardly put on my socks. “My ex-we and I went on vacation to New York City in 2012 and my weight really took a toll on me. When you’re in New York, there is a lot of walking involved. After a walk in Central Park I had to sit on a bench to catch my breath for a half an hour. I felt like a failure. I never prepared meals and I usually ate fast food, he added.   I would usually go to McDonald’s for lunch and order a Big Mac family meal, which was two Big Macs, two large fries, and two large cokes as well as 20 chicken nuggets.  I would drive through the drive through so they might think I was ordering the meal for a family. After I finished I always felt so bad about myself. I hated myself. For dinner I would order Pizza Hut or Domino\u0027s. I was almost as round as I was wide. My pants were 60ins and I was 67ins tall. Stephen said his  to the gym in October 2016 was extremely discouraging as he realised how far he had let his fitness slip.  But the former powerlter hit the gym every day and began practicing intermittent fasting which sees him eat only between 5pm and 9pm each evening. The combination, which Stephen has documented on his YouTube channel, has helped him shed 222lbs and his 60ins waist shrink to 32in. Stephen said: “My first time in the gym I was disgusted with myself. I could literally bench 175lbs which is as much as I could when I was a young teenager. “I don’t know how I had let myself get that far. “Gradually I’ve built myself back up 340lbs. “Now I practice intermittent fasting which means I only eat between 5pm and 9pm. When I get home I break my fast with an apple and for dinner I have ground turkey and a pound of green beans. “I have two cups of air popped popcorn and one low-fat ice cream.” "},{"url":null,"title":"scrabble dictionary adds 300 new","story":"NewsScrabble dictionary adds 300 new words - including one everyone\u0027s been waiting forThere\u0027s the potential to score some seriously high points with this updated list of acceptable wordsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer13:16, 25 SEP 2018News\" content=\"https:i2-prod.mirror/incoming/article212768.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_scrabble-image-2-308702789.jpg\"/These new words could help people win\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email We\u0027ve all tried putting down words in a game of Scrabble that we\u0027re not totally sure are legit to get a high score.

Benny, five, has been learning to skate for a year after his owner, former coach Cheryl Del Sangro, 56, took him along to a practice on a whim. During that first foray on the ice last winter, adorable Benny scooted around on the ice after his owner, gleefully - and skillfully - picking up pucks.  It inspired Cheryl - who had rescued the pup from death row at a shelter when he was just a few months old - to take him under her wing as her newest student .   The animal lover has since taken Benny training once every two weeks at the Las Vegas Ice Center, teaching him an array of tricks including turns, crossovers and bunny hops. \u2028She even made Benny a special pair of ice boots by attaching blades to doggy shoes, which he wears on his front paws while using his back paws for grip.  Incredible videos show the talented pup whizzing masterfully around the ice - and one clip has even racked up 30,000 views on Facebook .  Cheryl, of Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, said: “From day one, I couldn\u0027t believe how anyone could not want this dog. “He was absolutely perfect. We had this bond from the first day. “He\u0027s the happiest dog, and he loves learning new tricks. “Now, you can\u0027t keep him off the ice. He just keeps getting better and better. “You can\u0027t help but smile when you see it.”   She added: “We’ve looked into it and we can’t find any other dogs that can skate.”  Cheryl has been skating since she’s four and was a semi-professional in her twenties, but opted for a career in coaching which she pursued for 20 years. She later gave up the career to run a restaurant with her husband Flory, 68, and daughter Brittany, 35. But last year, Flory began attending physio sessions following hip surgery at a clinic close to the Las Vegas Ice Center. Cheryl decided to pop into the rink for a spin and instantly fell back in love. Shortly afterwards, she decided to take Benny onto the ice with her at the suggestion of a pal - and quickly realized he was a natural. She said: “Last winter I started skating a little bit just for myself to stay in shape.  “A friend of mine said we should make a video of Benny, getting some shots of him on the ice and I said, ‘OK, let\u0027s do it.’ “He followed me around and was running after me on the ice. Maybe because it\u0027s so hot here in Nevada, he enjoyed being out there in the cold. “He was rolling around on his back and everything. He enjoyed it so much. “Our daughter, Brittany, I taught her to skate when she was 17 months old. I thought, well,  I could get little 17 month old to skate, why couldn\u0027t I get him to skate?  “We took some dog boots and old blades and we glued them together. “I had him on a leash first in the rink and I helped him along with his feet. “He knows how to turn now, and do crossovers, and he can do little bunny hops with his front feet. “He\u0027s getting more powerful and soon we’re going to have to get the skates professionally put together.” Though the accomplished pup has only been on ice for a few short months, coach Cheryl has big plans in store. She plans to teach him a routine, get him spinning to music and hopes to secure him a part performing for the Vegas Golden Knights’ NHL team’s as on-ice entertainment. She said: “Our mission is to get a little bit more ice time. Next, I want to teach him a routine, maybe to do a spin with some music. “Every time anybody sees him skate, they just laugh. It\u0027s so unbelievable. “I had somebody offer me money to buy him a couple times since, but I would never, ever sell him.

The rear of the building, on Yeaman Shore, would also be remodelled to create an entrance.Internally, the building would have 102 underground car parking spaces.The ground floor would contain the

goods today at home to Hibs  they are to finally get some Premiership points on the board, according to midfield man Paul McGowan.In his usual no-nonsense fashion, McGowan admits the Dark Blues “haven’t been good enough” this season.That’s left them rooted to the foot of the table with no points to their name.The 30-year-old, though, is adamant Dundee have the ability to get themselves out of the trouble they find themselves in.He said: “A bit of luck is just missing for us right now but we need to make our own luck.“We need to start finishing the chances we are creating and we’re not keeping clean sheets.“That doesn’t bode well for trying to get the three points but we need to stick together, start from a clean sheet and then, hopefully, finish off a chance.“Listen, I could sit here and go through all sorts of stuff but it’s time to man up now and be counted.“It will be hard out there, the crowd will be on us a wee bit and rightly so with the way we have started but we need to overcome that and, hopefully, get them onside by putting in a performance.“We need to give them something to shout about because they haven’t had that.”And McGowan says he has no problem with having to deal with a bit of stick from the stands.“The fans have paid money so they’re entitled to have a moan because we’ve not been playing that well,” he added.“We accept that, we’re grown men and  you can’t take criticism then you shouldn’t be in this game.”After a 4-0 tanking at Ibrox last week where the Dark Blues were blown away in the early stages, trailing 2-0 within 15 minutes, McGowan has urged his team-mates to be more streetwise going forward.“You’ve got to weather that first 10, 15 minutes or so and we didn’t.“We gted them two goals and you can’t do that at Ibrox – you can’t do that against any team in this league.“We need to be more streetwise with how the game is going,  we’re under it a bit, just sit in and soak up the pressure until the game settles down a bit. We need to learn that.“Inidual mistakes are costing us and we’re getting punished for them all.“It’s amazing how quickly football can change. At the start of the season we had the chance to go 2-1 up at St Mirren but missed the penalty and then we conceded a freak goal.“Things like that can just turn and luck starts going against you but, listen, we haven’t been good enough.“I’m not going to make excuses or any rubbish like that – we haven’t been good enough and that’s down to the players.“We need to stand up and be counted and start showing how good a football team we are. We need to produce, starting today.“I believe in every one of us that we are good enough to get out of the situation we’re in.“It’s only five games into the season, a couple of wins gets us right up there.“I know we are a good footballing side, it’s the other side we need, being hard to beat and getting clean sheets.”The Dens men come up against a formidable attacking outfit when Neil Lennon’s Hibs come to town – McGowan, though, is certain Dundee can cause some problems of their own.He added: “Hibs are good going forward but they can be got at at the back. They are expansive, have a go, that’s the way Lenny like’s it but he’ll have them well-drilled and well up for it.“It’ll be a big ask for us to get the three points but I’m pretty sure we can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united boss csaba pleased to have more options for falkirk clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo admits he is relieved to, finally, have close to a full squad to choose from.Csaba will have more at his disposal for the clash at Championship bottom side Falkirk today and could hand starts to key men Fraser Fyvie and Billy King.Both are rated touch and go while Sam Stanton, Nicky Clark and Stewart Murdoch are working their way back to full training.Csaba said: “We have spoken with Fraser and he still hasn’t decided but he is not far enough along psychologically but I think, definitely, he will be part of the squad.“We are looking to protect the player in the long term, not just one game.“It will be a decision between him and me. He has worked very hard and the physios and doctors have done a good job.“You saw on Saturday how important a player he is for our team.“He told me that,  it’s necessary, he would come on to the pitch.“He may not be ready for 90 minutes but I think 45 could be OK for him.“Any decision from his side will be accepted from my side.

I am not a player made for playing without any pressure because then I wouldn’t be playing well.“I need pressure to thrive and it’s a big club – it should be in the Premiership.“It’s about how we deal with the pressure and Dundee United is probably the team with the most pressure on it in this league.“You feel like the fans definitely want to get out of the Championship. I want to get out of the Championship as well.“I’m not coming here to play my two seasons on my contract in the Championship.“It’s going to be a tough game and, in this league, every game is tough. It’s not because they are bottom of the league that we should underestimate them.“They have a new coach and they showed last week they played very good in the first half and the thing is they have nothing to lose, we have everything to lose.“You see in this league there is not one game you can predict. Everybody can beat each other.”After disappointing draws against Alloa and Morton in recent weeks, Frans knows there can be no more excuses.He has captained the side in the absence of the likes of Fraser Fyvie and Stewart Murdoch and feels they are now more equipped, with their ‘leaders’ coming back to the squad, to go on a winning run.“If you look at the way we played last weekend, we had 11 players starting who weren’t here last year but still we produce some good stuff,” he added.“We need to be more efficient. We missed a few chances but also we concede every game.“I do think we defend well but somehow we concede a penalty and the week before it was a free-kick against Alloa.“It is not because of bad defending, just small things, and we need to get better at them.“I think you see every week we are improving but, OK, there comes a time you need to put it in results and start to go on a run.“You see Fraser Fyvie coming back, Billy King, Sam Stanton is still injured, Murdoch is out.“These are players who would walk into a lot of Championship teams and be the leaders.“There are positive things to look forward to.”United will go toe-to-toe with pointless bottom side Falkirk today on an articial surface.However, Frans says they will not be using that or the ongoing stormy weather as excuses for another disappointing display.“I don’t like to talk about the pitch because I don’t want to have any excuses. Whatever pitch it is we should play well.“We went to Queen of the South and I think the first half we produced one of the best performances since I’ve been here.“You come up against dferent circumstances and maybe it’s going to be 100mph wind.“Every week it’s something so  you think too much about circumstances you are not focused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"falkirk boss ray mckinnon looks ahead to clash with old club dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon accepts there will be an added dimension to this weekend’s game against old club Dundee United because he is only “human”.However, the Falkirk manager is adamant his sole focus will be on trying to land a first league win of the season for his new team.McKinnon will be facing United for the first time since being sacked by the Tangerines in October last year.He was axed just 10 games into the season with the Tannadice outfit in fourth place and just five points off the top of the Championship.He said: “I’m treating it just as another game but I am human, so I am naturally going to look at all the scenarios.“However, the focus will definitely be just on us and making sure we are set up properly.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/KMil_Penguin_Auct-17.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"here is how much each maggies penguin parade statue sold for at the public auction in va dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn incredible £540,000 was raised for Maggie\u0026#8217s at a public auction at the conclusion of the popular Penguin Parade.A packed audience at the V\u0026ampA gasped in delight as the £539,000 total was announced following frantic bidding for the 82 lots on offer.A donation of £1000 from the floor rounded the total figure to the fundraising target of £540,000 \u0026#8211  meaning which is the costs to run Maggie\u0026#8217s Dundee for a year.P-Pick Up The Phone Penguin was the highest-selling figure going for an incredible £11,000.Judy Murray snapped up Andy Murray-themed Don for £10,000, while the Dundee and United penguins went for £5k and £6, respectively.Here is what each penguin sold for:1 Bonnie Dundee £6,5002 R2DunDee2 £5,5003 Mr Sofishticated £4,0004 Blue Planet Penguin £6,0005 Bagpipes \u0026amp Flippers £9,0006 Engullfed £5,0007 Sid the Penguin £9,0008 Charles £10,0009 Gothamatryoshka £5,00010 Don £10,00011 What Lies Beneath £7,00012 4 Seasons in One Day £5,50013 Heat Reactive Hue £4,00014 I Choose Dundee £7,00015 Dundee Star’s Penguin £6,00016 Absent Penguin £5,00017 Pinguis Anatomica £4,50018 Punky Penguin! £7,00019 Dundee United FC Penguin £6,00020 Sunrise £7,00021 Pen Broon £5,50022 Emperor’s Voyage of Discovery £8,00023 Dazzle Penguin £5,50024 Peter Panguin £7,00025 Pluguin £6,00026 The Store Hus Pingvin £3,50027 Penguinstein £6,00028 Journalism £10,00029 Old Tom Morris £7,00030 Penguin Street £6,00031 WellBEEing £7,00032 Capguin Scott £5,50033 Pop and Pip £9,00034 “PJ” The Poetry Penguin £6,00035 I Believe I Can Fly £10,00036 Fish Food £4,50037 Lord P.

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 7:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117654.jpg","title":"Pensioner pleads for help with poorly cat","story":"\u0026nbspAn Inverness pensioner is appealing for help with her cat\u0027 medical treatment after discovering that her monthly pet plan does not cover the cost of an X-ray.Marie MacIver\u0027 five-year-old cat Charlie has a painful leg and needs the scan to determine what treatment can be given.However, Mrs MacIver, who relies on disability benefit, is unable to afford the X-ray, which will cost about \u0026pound300.She has now contacted the\u0026nbspmedia in a plea for kind-hearted Invernessians to come forward.\"There is no way I can afford to pay for the X-ray,\" she said.\"Since it\u0027 very dficult for me to get out, I have already had to pay for the vet to come to the house and give Charlie a medical, as well as a bottle of anti-inflammatories which cost \u0026pound29 and did nothing.\"I already pay \u0026pound10 a month for a pet plan but it doesn\u0026rsquot seem to cover anything.\"I have tried everywhere to get help with the vet\u0027 bills \u0026ndash the PDSA, RSPCA and Cats Protection, but I haven\u0026rsquot been able to get help from anywhere.\"I hate to see him in pain and I think it\u0027 getting worse.\"It came out of the blue about a month ago, and now it is just not going away.\"Mrs MacIver lives alone with Charlie and says she has a special bond with her little cat.\"He\u0027 my companion and is often the only company I have,\" she said.\"He sleeps on my bed and follows me into the kitchen, and he seems to know not to stray too far from the house because I need him.\"He\u0027 really more like a dog than a cat.\"I try my best to take care of him but things like this are very dficult, and it is such a shame because he is a lovely little cat.\"I need to help Charlie get better.\"\u0026nbspCan you help Mrs MacIver with the cost of Charlie\u0027 X-ray?

The market has the latest refrigeration technology and capacity for 10,000 boxes of fish at one time.With access for boats on the quayside and lorries on shore, it is hoped the new market will ensure product quality is maintained as the fish pass through.

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan. However, neither is promoted and both are largely ignored.\u0026#8216The only time senior management appear to take any interest in those iniduals and families living with autism is  it they think it is going to cost the authority money.\u0026#8216At senior manager level, Argyll and Bute Council has rejected our knowledge, rebuffed our experiences, frustrated our efforts, sapped our enthusiasm, drained our goodwill and defeated us.\u0026#8217There is good news, however. Operating in Argyll and Bute with the support of Scottish Autism, the Get Set 4 Autism project provides online resources for professionals dealing with autism.Parents of recently diagnosed children also have access to an autism advisor and the Right Click online programme, helping to provide clear, timely and sensible information and support.Alison continued: \u0026#8216Autism Argyll has raised awareness, improved knowledge and understanding, and forged partnerships with iniduals and organisations such as Scottish Autism. We should be proud of our achievements.\u0026#8217Responding to the criticism, an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We are saddened that Autism Argyll has been dissolved and we thank the organisation for its work down the years to educate the wider community on autism and to support people living with the condition.\u0026#8216We are working with our partners, including Cornerstone and Scottish Autism, on the development of residential resources in Garelochhead and Helensburgh, and also to improve services for people with autism across Argyll and Bute by way of introducing and implementing the Autism Toolbox.\u0026#8216Additionally, we have engaged with Autism Network Scotland for their assistance in further implementing our autism strategy, and these meetings will continue.\u0026#8217Responsibility for autism support also falls under the remit of Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership, and a spokesman confirmed that it had advertised for a new autism practitioner.He added: \u0026#8216We have been working closely with our partners to support those iniduals living in Argyll and Bute with autism and we have been exploring how we can build on the current services that are available. \u0026#8216PICS:Back to the beginning \u0026#8211 Autism Argyll is formed in 2000. no_a38AutismArgyll01Committee members past and present gather for the last-ever Autism Argyll AGM. 06_a38AutismArgyll03It was an emotional occasion for founder members Maureen MacIntosh, left, and chairwoman Alison Leask. 06_a38AutismArgyll02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"furnace shop and post office facing closure","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 2:49 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFurnace Village Store and Post Office is set to close at the end of the year unless someone can be found to carry on the business.The shop, with its three-bedroom bungalow behind, has been owned and managed by Mike and Syb Masters for the past 18 years.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

An early-morning police raid revealed Thomas Caldwell’s disgusting collection. The 35-year-old was caught with 18 Category A movies- showing the most vile type of child abuse. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that Caldwell, of Kyle StreetAyr, immediately admitted that he ‘downloaded some stuff’. And he blurted out to officers “I don’t get a lot of girls”. Caldwell admitted being in possession of the indecent material between March 15 and November 6. And he faced his sentencing last Thursday for his heinous behaviour. Defence solicitor Tony Currie told Sherf John Montgomery: “He did everything to be compliant with the police process. “He’s a man who’s used pornography in the past and he’s unfortunately allowed it to stray on these occasions. “He lost his employment as a direct consequence because of this matter and he’s actually sourced alternative employment.”  The Sherf queried reference made in the reports to one 27-minute long video. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin replied: “That’s the one they’ve chosen to describe in detail.” Steering clear of putting Caldwell behind bars, the Sherf said: “Quite clearly any offence of this gravity well merits a custodial sentence. “But my  is to consider  custody is the only option. “And in your case, involving mitigating and aggravating factors in respect of your offence -I’ve come to the conclusion that the mitigating outweighs the aggravating, and therefore conclude that you could be dealt with by way of a community payback order. “You will be supervised in the community for three years and it will be a requirement that you will be part of the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. “You do not approach or speak to a child under the age of 16 unless approved from your supporting officer.” Caldwell was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, and must not access the internet via computer or mobile phone. He has been placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register.

The boss saw his side blitz Falkirk with a second half super show on Saturday. And he insists inspiration was drawn not from his words – but the famous Somerset Road End. McCall admitted: “People are giving me credit for some kind of masterful team talk. “But the reality is our fans were dferent class and played a huge part in getting us back into that game. “At times it felt like the Somerset Road End was pulling the ball into the net. “That’s what makes this such a dficult place for opposition teams to come and we need to make the most of it. “I honestly don’t think our fans realise just how important they are to the team. “Saturday was proof of the key part they can play so let’s hope there’s a lot more to come.” United boast a 100 per cent record on home turf this season and McCall is determined that Somerset will become a fortress again. He said: “You look at the league and would maybe say Ross County have that class edge because of the money they’ve spent. “They have a Premier League squad. “But as for everyone else...there’s no reason why we can’t hold our own.  “Nobody is going to get an easy game at our place and we’re proving we can live with the other sides in this ision. “Had we kept 11 men on the park at Inverness we’d have won there and would be sitting top of the league right now. “So we know  we play at our best we’re a match for anyone.” Ayr will head for old rivals Alloa tomorrow knowing they have a chance to hit top spot should results go their way. Jamie Adams will be rested from the articial surface while Daniel Harvie completes his two match suspension. McCall said: “I’ve got Steven Bell banging down my door wanting to play so we have no issues there. “It’s getting to the stage where a number of guys are giving me real headaches.” •Craig McGuffie bagged a hat trick as Ayr’s reserves beat Airdrie 3-2 on Monday. •Ayr have pledged to defend a court action from former right back Jonathan Tfoney.

Last October, the Post reported how devastated cancer patients would have to travel up to 100 miles for le-saving chemotherapy as the axe falls on the treatment at Ayr Hospital. And it could take them three hours to travel from the Carrick area like the village of Ballantrae to Crosshouse in Kilmarnock as hospital chiefs push ahead with plans to centralise services. A campaigner attended a meeting of Cumnock Community Council to get their support for the campaign. He said: “I was asked to get involved in a steering group in January to fight this. “I don’t think we can’t facilitate the amount of patients in Kilmarnock “We want to keep two open. “It is consultation period just now but we think that they are going to shut the one in Ayr. “We will be looking to host roadshows to the public. “In this area, cancer had affected a lot of the population. “Very few people in this area know about the proposals. “They want to take everything down to Crosshouse.” Cumnock Community Council agreed to support the campaign. One community councillor said: “I think we need to fight this. “We also need to think of people who live in the likes of Damellington and Patna.” And the campaigner said: “We will fight to keep it open. We want the support of community councils, MSPs and councillors to keep the facility in Ayr open.” A community councillor said: “We should write to our MP andMSPs. They should listen to us and we should write to them and ask them to come here. “We should fight to keep two of them open. We should be ploughing money into the two of them. We should be fighting for two of them.” A NHS Ayrshire and Arran spokeswoman said the future arrangements for Chemotherapy Services in Ayrshire and Arran remain under review. She added: “An important aspect of reviewing the service is to ensure that we can continue to deliver increasingly complex chemotherapy treatments to the highest standards possible, taking account of all relevant clinical evidence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"new ayrshire nursery gets thumbs","story":"NewsNew Ayrshire nursery gets the thumbs upHuge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:00, 24 SEP 2018NewsHeads of Ayr farm park nursery design \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new nursery is to be built surrounded by farmyard animals and cute critters. Huge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park. And up to 20 jobs will be created. In a recent Ayrshire Post article celebrating 25 years of the farm park bosses Craig and Edna Rankin were excited about gaining approval for the nursery. They had suffered a blow as planning officials knocked it back in March on seven dferent policy points. But the couple’s architect Chris Stewart of Casa design in Ayr revealed: “Planning permission has now been granted for a new nursery school for up to 60 children. “It was approved on appeal on by the councillors on the Local Review Body.” Naturally the new nursery will have an outdoor theme. Edna said: “There is demand to get children back to nature and get outdoors. “There are so many new houses at Fisherton and Doonfoot and the area needs something. “Our own staff here cannot even find places to send their children.” Highly unusually, the plan had won universal support from the public with not one objection lodged with South Ayrshire Council. The application had been sent in earlier in 2017 but it was thrown out in December by council planners who were branded “very negative” by the architect. The site is currently a donkey pasture to the left of the farm steading and attractions and will include a new dedicated entrance from the A719 and car parking. The nursery will be built in the agricultural style with plenty of wooden cladding and some roof lights to mock a barn. The park attracts 180,000 people a year and has 90 staff. Director Greg Rankin said: “We were delighted to have planning for the Nursery granted by the Councils Local Review Board and I would like to thank them. “They were able to see the clear benefits that this project will bring to the area both for the local economy and local families . As well as all of the advantages to having a Nursery on site at Heads of Ayr Farm Park providing kids with the chance to learn and play in a safe outdoor environment. “Work on the Nursery starts shortly and we hope to have construction completed by Autumn next year. We are very excited to get started on its development and have been encouraged by lots of support from Locals and regular visitors of the Farm Park.” Casa Design architect Chris added: “It has taken two years to get to this stage, with ious consultations with the Planning Department and the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. The owners of the Farm Park have extensively researched this type of rural nursery, tied in with farm parks elsewhere in the UK and are very excited about the project. “It was very disappointing that the Planning Department decided to refuse the application in March this year on seven points which they construed as being contrary to the South Ayrshire Local Development Plan and Scottish Planning Policy. “We have found the Planning Department to be very negative with this application from the start. However, we are delighted that after an appeal, the councillors at the Local Review Body hearing this week saw the bigger picture and overturned their planners decision to refuse the application.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"pro wrestling elite stage stacked","story":"NewsPro Wrestling Elite to stage stacked card in Ayr as Kenny Williams defends Heavyweight TitleThe thrills and spills of PWE are ing to Ayr Town Hall tomorrow night with a packed card.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet15:16, 21 SEP 2018NewsPro Wrestling Elite champion Kenny Williams\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat tomorrow as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

Two more goals from Lawrence Shankland helped the Honest Men to victory at Alloa, putting them in prime shape for Wednesday\u0027s Betfred Cup trip to Ibrox. So what did we learn from this afternoon\u0027s display?   1. Shank You Very Much   Ayr fans are running out of superlatives for their star man and he delivered once again here. Lawrence Shankland arrived at Somerset Park 12 months ago with a reputation of unfulfilled talent - but it\u0027s safe to say he has long since put that record straight. Shankland is much more than a penalty box striker and he proved it again here with an all action display, leading from the front. His first goal - a clinical finish - underlined the class dference between these sides and Ayr rarely looked back. Most pleasing for United fans was the sight of Shankland berating teammates for a couple of loose passes as the clock ticked down in its final seconds. His desire and drive to raise standards is proving an example to all and with Shankland in their ranks, the sky could be the limit for Ayr.   2. Liam\u0027s A Touch Of Class   He was talked up as a quality signing and Liam Smith is proving the real deal. The Scotland under-21 full back has been deployed on the left during Daniel Harvie\u0027s suspension and, even though not his natural position, has looked a standout. Once again he offered Ayr real thrust here and was involved in most of their positive play. Boss Ian McCall has said he expects Smith to slot in at right back in the long term, but with such competition for places it is a nice problem to have.    3. Could Ayr Really Stun Rangers?   This was a workmanlike performance from United and they will need to raise their game signicantly to trouble Steven Gerrard\u0027s men on Wednesday night. But Ayr will rarely have the chance to go to Ibrox in better heart and in Shankland they have a genuine match winner who would not look out of place at the top of Scotland\u0027s Premiership. If they can hold their nerve and service the 15-goal striker, they may just cause a shock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterRangers NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Rangers newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotland U21s football teamAyr United FCAlloa Athletic FCRangers FC"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon pensioners 900 mile solo","story":"NewsTroon pensioner\u0027s 900-mile solo effort for charityGeorge Dunlop, from Troon, peddled across the country to raise money for Ayrshire Cancer Support, who offered him care and help 28 years ago when he had cancer.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie12:46, 25 SEP 2018Updated12:47, 25 SEP 2018NewsGeorge reaches Land’s End as he crosses the finish line \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pensioner with an articial knee has cycled almost 900 miles in the name of charity. George Dunlop, from Troon, peddled across the country to raise money for Ayrshire Cancer Support, who offered him care and help 28 years ago when he had cancer. The 68-year-old cycled from John O’Groats to Land’s End and despite having an articial knee and suffering a puncture at Birmingham, George completed the cycle in 19 days. Cancer survivor George said: “I had never forgotten the help Ayrshire Cancer Support gave me getting to hospital, and I wanted to  the favour. “The cycle was hard going but I had something in my system that refused to give in. “I did it all on my own, without back-up, and it was a tremendous. “I cycled on canals and old railway lines and, to make up time, sometimes on busy roads.” George lived in Fenwick until 2015 and, following the passing of his we, moved to Troon.  Having been diagnosed with cancer in 1990 and survived the illness, he was motivated to complete the series of climbing all of Scotland’s 282 Munros. When given the all-clear, he had taken up cycling to regain full fitness and continues to cover many miles on two wheels each week. Laura Brown, income and marketing manager for Ayrshire Cancer Support, said: “Despite not liking to ask anyone for money, George collected \u0026pound300, including \u0026pound130 on the road during his arduous cycle the  of the UK. “I’m sure when people know that he has undertaken this huge cycle in aid of Ayrshire Cancer Support, they will be only too delighted to dig deep and show their support. “We are grateful for the support of all fundraisers, whose generosity is crucial to the services we provide for those affected by cancer. “George pulled out all the stops to benefit Ayrshire Cancer Support and it is thanks to him that we can continue supporting families all across Ayrshire affected by cancer.” People can donate to George’s appeal by sending cheques or donating directly to Ayrshire Cancer Support at 22 Wellington Square, Ayr.

Mark Crane insists the rising star from Buckinghamshire will curb his temper during this week\u0027s clash in Paris. It comes as the spotlight shines on Europe\u0027s underdogs and their ability to perform against a formidable American line-up. But Crane, who has proved a lethal partner for Hatton since taking his bag earlier this year, believes Hatton will thrive in the Paris pressure cooker. He said: People have a perception of Tyrrell from the TV and view him as a fiery character. Away from that he\u0027s actually quite dferent and we get on incredibly well, which is why it works on the course. He wears his heart on his sleeve and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that. I guess I\u0027m there as the calming influence! The pair have joined forces to register top ten finishes in the US Open and PGA Championship this season. And Crane, 36, who runs Prestwick\u0027s Bar Central, is expecting another big performance. He said: Everyone is tipping the Americans but I’m not sure why they’re favourites. The Europeans know this course well and being accurate off the tee will be vital. Do the Americans have a formidable looking team? Sure. But we also have plenty of guys at the top of their game and it\u0027s going to be an incredible contest.  The appearance marks Crane\u0027s second Ryder Cup, following his debut in 2016 at Hazeltine carrying the bag of Chris Wood. Meanwhile, Barassie greenkeeper Kerr is among an army of 180 course staff working at Le Golf National. The 39-year-old, now a course manager in Gothenburg, Sweden, said: “It’s a huge honour. “Any golf fan would give their right arm to be involved in what is the pinnacle of our sport. “The rough is long and will undoubtedly favour the Europeans. “But you look at the line-up coming across from America and have to say they are worthy favourites.” Kerr, who grew up playing Royal Troon, has been drafted in by friend, Alejandro Reyes, who is course manager at the Ryder Cup venue. Kerr said: “This will be the second Ryder Cup I’ve worked at and nothing compares to the event. “I’m on holes two, three, 13 and 14 and some of the stuff they’ve done with the course is incredible. “It’s been totally stripped back and rebuilt just for this week.” The event kicks off on Friday and is live on Sky Sports from 6.30am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnRyder CupTroonPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"amazon-adventurer-pip-takes-the-path-for-galashiels","story":"PIP Stewart likes a challenge.\nShe\u0026rsquos cycled 10,000 miles from Kuala Lumpur to London in time to start a new job, pedalled and paddled the distance between Brazil and Peru, and most recently kayaked the entire  of the Essequibo River, the largest in Guyana and third-longest in South America.\nBut, for Pip, these adventures are not just about pushing physical limits, they are opportunities to raise awareness of environmental and human issues that exist in the area.\nAnd this is her ambition as she speaks as part of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society\u0027s Inspiring People talks programme in Galashiels next Tuesday .\nIn her talk, entitled Human Reflections in the Amazon, Pip will share stories and insights from her travels in the region, with a focus on her recent 1,000 km kayak down the Essequibo River in Guyana and the people she met along the way.\nLargely unheard of in the UK, the Essequibo is almost entirely untouched by humans.\nAs such, it has a rich flora and fauna playing home to more than 300 unique species of fish.\nAnd, prior to Pip\u0026rsquos expedition, a signicant portion of the upper river had never been paddled before, making it one of the last great exploratory wonders of the world with potential for a genuine world record.\nStarting in the interior of the country, at the source of the river, the all-female team consisting of Pip, Laura Bingham and Ness Knight were soon required to traverse the imposing Acari Mountains and navigate through remote Wai Wai Lands, the home of the intriguing Wai Wai People, a Carib-speaking Amerindian population who, in Guyana, number just 1,000.\nFollowing this, Pip and the team moved downstream through some of the most fascinating and untouched rainforests in the world, roaring rapids and contentious gold-mining areas.

This is simply not good enough and the SNP\u0026rsquos failure to deliver is holding Scottish businesses back and is unfair for consumers.\nThe report shows around a quarter of those in rural areas, such as the Borders, still cannot get speeds of 10mbps or more.\nThe European Union\u0026rsquos definition of superfast internet, which the Scottish Government has adopted, is 30mbps.\nBut local MSP Christine Grahame  said there were positives to highlight: \u0026ldquoBroadband access is in fact a matter reserved to the Tory UK Government, however  it hadn\u0026rsquot been for the intervention of the Scottish Government, the percentage of premises connected to fibre broadband in the Borders would be 39.3 per cent, rather than the current 91.4 per cent.\n\u0026ldquoThis report recognises that the roll out won\u0026rsquot be easy to deliver, but that is why this SNP Government has matched its ambition for broadband with \u0026pound600 million of investment \u0026ndash the biggest public investment ever made in a UK broadband project.\n\u0026ldquoI would highlight that the report also praises the Scottish Government for exceeding its target of 95 per cent fibre broadband coverage across Scotland by the end of 2017.\n\u0026ldquoAnd that, due to higher than expected take-up and lower than expected costs, the programme will in fact reach 60,300 more premises than planned \u0026ndash at no extra cost to the public sector.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos absolutely disgraceful that, despite being a reserved matter, the UK Government\u0026rsquos funding contribution to R100 is just three per cent of the total \u0026ndash perhaps Mr Lamont should focus on putting pressure on his colleagues in the Tory UK Government to step up to the plate and better support Scotland\u0026rsquos ambitions.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltown learns about the air ace of argyll","story":"A collection of artefacts belonging to an Argyll airship captain and First World War

a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on to Helensburgh and Dunoon.Councillor John Armour,

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

He said: \u0026ldquoWe are about to begin consultation on our plans for the next stage of development at the National Museum of Flight and warmly invite members of the public to come and hear our plans and tell us what they think.  \u0026ldquoWe are working with Hoskins Architects to design an entirely new hangar to be built on land right next to the museum\u0026rsquos home at East Fortune Airfield.  \u0026ldquoThis would provide a permanent home for the museum\u0026rsquos star attraction, Scotland\u0026rsquos Concorde, and help us protect other historically important aircraft which are currently at risk because they are displayed outdoors.  \u0026ldquoThe new building would enable us to signicantly improve the experience for visitors to the museum by creating a new entrance with better public facilities.  \u0026ldquoIt also presents us with the opportunity to rethink and enhance the presentation of the historic Second World War airfield, which is an important artefact in its own right.

The drop-in session, which runs from 3pm to 7pm, will allow members of the public to see the initial designs and also speak to members of the team behind the proposals. A second event takes place 6-8pm at East Linton Primary School on October 24.  Mr Rintoul added: \u0026ldquoThe National Museum of Flight is already a signicant component of East Lothian\u0026rsquos visitor economy and this investment will drive additional employment opportunities and help further stimulate the development of the area\u0026rsquos tourism sector.  \u0026ldquoThis is the next step in the development of the museum, which started with the arrival of Concorde in 2004 and has seen extensive investment in the site in recent years, including the creation of new exhibitions in 2009 and the restoration and re-display of two original Second World War hangars in 2016.  \u0026ldquoWe hope that residents will take the opportunity to come along to one of our two planned consultation events, view the design and discuss it with our team.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip.

The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.

Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.

It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful.

The plan is a step closer after being awarded \u0026pound8,640 from the Scottish Land Fund.  Sustaining Dunbar claims the project could add \u0026pound800,000 a year to the local economy.  Osbert Lancaster, development officer, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThe building has been standing empty for some time.  \u0026ldquoUntil we know the full condition of the building and cost of remedial work and refurbishment, we don\u0026rsquot know  the project will be financially viable.

The 67-year-old from Ardtalnaig, Perth and Kinross, says she knows there will come a time when she won\u0026rsquot recognise their faces or know who they are.  The considerate grandmother is also writing them each a letter before her memory deteriorates.  Although she was diagnosed with the \"horrible\" illness, Olive says she still remains determined to make the most of her le while she\u0027s able.  She said: \"I was born in Scotland and in my family it was always a tradition that once you turned 21 you would receive a key - it\u0027s an old-fashioned thing.  \"I did the same thing for my kids.  \"So because of my personal experience I felt it was a good idea to do the same for my grandkids.  \"But because I have vascular dementia I\u0027ve had to prepare it early. I went to an antic store in Edinburgh to get the keys for them.  \"And I\u0027m going to write letters to all of them too.  \"I really hope they will appreciate this special tradition and that they will also do it with their own children someday.\"  Olive has been married to Ronnie, 74, for 41 years and she still keeps a close bond with her three children - Douglas, 46, Alene, 48, and Christopher, 43.  Her six grandchildren are Andrew, 17, Colin, 12, twins Liam and Connor, eight, Luka, seven, and Isla, four.  When she was first diagnosed with the illness, Olive said she felt her le had suddenly stopped.  She said: \"When I first found out I was fed up and depressed, I didn\u0027t want to talk about it with anyone.  \"I eventually sucked it all up and I thought  I decide to give up then I would have already been defeated.  \"You just never know which part of your brain will go first but I will enjoy today and worry about tomorrow later.\"  When Olive realised she was no longer good at mental arithmetic and struggled to remember words, she took it upon herself to find out  she had dementia - as there is a family history of the condition on the female side.  That was in 2012 when she was 61 and had ed to Scotland to retire after 40 years in Canada.  The gran-of-six was referred for tests and, aged 63, was told she had a 10 per cent memory loss at that stage.  In 2015, following further tests, she was officially diagnosed with vascular dementia.  Recently, Olive, who previously managed a care home, completed a mammoth trek to raise money for pioneering research.  On May 1 Olive started walking the famous Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route through France and northern Spain with her husband, Ronnie, for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK.  Walking a minimum of 10km each day, the couple took two months to complete the 780km route \u0026ndash a month quicker than planned.  She said: \"I was looking for ideas for something we could do to raise money.  \"There are some things I can\u0026rsquot do, but I watched the film The Way, starring Martin Sheen, where they trek the Comino de Santiago route, and I thought \u0026lsquoI can walk, let\u0026rsquos go for that\u0026rsquo.  \"The trek was very tough, but we got stronger and stronger each day.  \"The hardest point was early on when we both got sick.  \"Because we were focused on walking, we didn\u0026rsquot realise how ill we were. We had to stop and rest for three days.\"  Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia and occurs when blood flow to the brain becomes reduced.  It\u0026rsquos estimated to affect about 150,000 people in the UK and is rare in people under 65.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-and-senior-colleagues-resist-party-pressure-for-backing-peoples-vote","story":"  Party sources suggested the likely outcome of deliberations on having a vote at the end of a debate on Brexit tomorrow would be a \u0026ldquofudge, which would stress the party\u0026rsquos clear preference for another general election, should Theresa May\u0026rsquos final plan on Britain\u0026rsquos EU withdrawal fail to get the support of MPs later this year.  Any move by the Labour leadership to directly back the so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash the supporters of which say it should include the option of staying in the EU - would be a reversal of policy, which is simply to keep it on the table.  It would also be a landmark decision in the Brexit process as it would align Labour not only with the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign itself but also the Liberal Democrats.  Mr Corbyn said he was \u0026ldquobound by the democracy of our party but also noted: \u0026ldquoLet\u0027s see what comes out of conference.  His deputy Tom Watson also made clear  party members voted to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote, he would support the move.  \"Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour Party back to its members. So,  the people\u0027s party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it,\" he said.  Last night, around 100 Labour delegates were engaged in intense discussions behind closed doors deciding on the key issue of the wording of the Brexit motion to be debated and voted upon.  Earlier, the Labour leader, while he made clear he would support the will of the party  its members decided to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote, stressed he personally believed a general election would be a better way to resolve the political crisis over the nature of the UK\u0027s departure from the EU.  And Len McCluskey, the Unite leader, warned that any second vote on Brexit should not be asking  the public wanted to stay in the EU as proposed by those supporting a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  \"We have already had a People\u0027s Vote they voted to come out of the EU,\" declared Mr McCluskey.  At a fringe event last night, he warned: \"We have to be careful about how we play with our democracy.\"  Highlighting the tensions at the top of the party, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, admitted to having \"reservations\" about backing another vote because, she argued, the Conservative Government \"might be able to skew it in particular directions to secure the result they wanted\".  The Labour leadership, which has always said it respected the 2016 referendum result, is fearful that any open support for a second EU vote, which included the option of reversing that decision, would alienate a swathe of Labour voters, who backed Brexit.  The position of the leadership has been made dficult after a poll found 86 per cent of Labour members thought voters should have the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations and 90 per cent said they would now vote to remain in the EU.  Yesterday in Liverpool, thousands of people, including MPs, MEPs, trade union leaders and activists marched through the city and attended a rally, calling for a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  As he addressed the gathering Labour MP David Lammy said: \"Are you listening Jeremy Corbyn?\"  Highlighting how people from across the UK were present, the Tottenham MP said: \"They are saying squarely to the leadership of the Labour Party: \u0027Listen to us, hear us, give us a People\u0027s Vote.\u0027  \"When we have that People\u0027s Vote let us ensure that the option to remain in the EU is on the ballot paper,\" he declared.  A crowd waving EU and other flags chanted \"b*****ks to Brexit\" and \"it\u0027s not a done deal\" as they walked from St George\u0027s Hall in the city centre to the rally at Pier Head, close to where the conference is taking place.  Manuel Cortes, the General Secretary of the TSSA transport union, also backed calls for Labour to support a second referendum on Brexit.  \"The terms of Brexit should be put to the British people,\" he declared, adding: \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union but that doesn\u0027t mean buying a pig in the poke or giving the Prime Minister a blank cheque. Whatever she negotiates she needs to bring back to the British people.\"  Last night at a rally at the World Transformed Festival, running alongside the conference, Mr Corbyn said the rich were on \"borrowed time\" as he took aim at their tax breaks and offshore havens.  After receiving a rapturous reception, he told the audience the \"poorest and most vulnerable\" had been forced to pay the price for the 2008 financial crash.  The Labour leader said that winning an election was \"not going to be easy\" but hailed the power of \"popular movements coming together\".  Stressing how challenging neoliberal economics was \u0026ldquofundamental to what we believe in,\" Mr Corbyn added: \"Austerity has been meted out on the poorest and most vulnerable people in our society.  \"They are the ones who paid the price of the banking crisis of 2008, all the time the very richest in our society have had tax breaks, giveaways and tax havens.  \"I tell you what: they are on borrowed time because a Labour government is coming.\""},{"url":null,"title":"marianne-taylor-jeremy-corbyn-has-one-last-chance-to-do-the-right-thing-over-brexit","story":"  At the other end of the political spectrum Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have descended upon Liverpool for surely the most important Labour conference in a generation. Despite spending a long, hot summer fiddling while Rome burned, becoming ever more deeply embroiled in an antisemitism row rather than putting forward a coherent position on Brexit, the party still has a chance to help lead the country away from the Brexit clf edge.  After all, backing a second referendum on Brexit is the party\u0026rsquos last chance to make a meaningful, potentially game-changing contribution at this moment of crisis. If it fails to do so future generations will never forgive Mr Corbyn for blowing the chance to either stop or soften Brexit.  What is the point of Labour  it is not to protect the folk from the worst excesses of the Tories? And make no mistake, it\u0026rsquoll be the already brutalised millions in the middle and at the bottom who will suffer most from the no-deal Brexit we are careering towards.  Yet the mood music coming from party leadership remains as off-tune as ever. Yesterday, Mr Corbyn grudgingly conceded he would back the so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote  his membership absolutely insists upon it, arguing that a general election is the answer to the country\u0026rsquos currently problems.  Meanwhile, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said over the weekend that Labour would push ahead with Brexit  it won a snap election, insisting his party would somehow miraculously get a much better deal from the EU than the Tories, despite also having ruled out staying in the single market. Does he honestly believe Brussels will look more favourably on Labour rejecting fundamental EU principles such as free movement than the Tories? Didn\u0026rsquot he see President Macron\u0026rsquos two-fingered reaction to Mrs May\u0026rsquos rhetoric last week?  It is simply not credible for Labour to fight a general election on a manesto that favours ploughing ahead with a similarly destructive Brexit when a poll would only be necessary because the Conservatives had failed to agree a plan.  Mr McDonnell also claimed during an interview that pulling back from Brexit could result in xenophobia. What planet is he living on? Can\u0026rsquot he see that leaving the EU hands victory on a plate to the xenophobes?  A recent tweet by his shadow cabinet colleague Barry Gardiner revealed just how twisted the logic of the party leadership has become. When asked by a despairing Labour activist why the current Brexit chaos elicited only silence from Labour, Mr Gardiner replied: \u0026ldquoNever interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.  The idea that keeping your mouth shout and failing to make a credible alternative case, either for a soft Brexit or no Brexit at all, makes you a suitable and trustworthy opposition when the country is heading for utter disaster is either naive, arrogant or stupid - most likely all three.  Despite continual obfuscation, it\u0026rsquos crystal clear that Mr Corbyn and his deputy are as Eurosceptic as many of the Tories they have spent their lives opposing. In light of this, perhaps Mr Gardiner\u0026rsquos tweet should more accurately have stated: \u0026ldquoNever interrupt your enemy when he is saying something you agree with, but don\u0026rsquot have the guts to admit to.  I\u0026rsquom not suggesting Mr Corbyn should not be allowed to oppose Britain\u0026rsquos EU membership. What I\u0026rsquom saying is that he should have been honest about it from the start. As a potential prime minister, however, he must also be able to let go of personal principles, no matter how deeply and honestly held, when the good of the country is at stake. As we have seen regularly since his election, however - most recently during the antisemitism debacle - compromise is not something that comes easy to this dogmatic old Leftie.  We must hope, therefore, that the party membership, many of whom are young people who oppose Brexit, can force common sense upon the leadership. There is overwhelming support there for a second referendum, with one recent poll suggesting 85 per cent want a say on the outcome of negotiations, with an even higher proportion in favour staying in the EU.  There would potentially be a signicant electoral boost in adopting the People\u0026rsquos Vote, at last giving Labour a strong, distinctive and viable policy that people from across the UK - including Scotland - could get behind. And an electoral lt is exactly what the party needs despite taking the country to the edge of the abyss, the Tories remain ahead in the polls.  Mr Corbyn now has one final opportunity to redeem himself and put country before conviction. We must hope he has the sense and humility to take it."},{"url":null,"title":"non-religious-pupils-could-be-excluded-from-nativity-plays","story":"  The attack comes after the Church said such pupils would face wider exclusion from \"charitable fundraising, Nativity plays and feast day celebrations\".  Officials from the Humanist Society Scotland and Secular Scotland said denominational schools could even face legal action  they followed the advice.  Earlier this month First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government intended to incorporate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into Scots Law.  The a move is signicant because the UN\u0027s Children\u0027s Rights Committee recommended the current right of parents in Scotland to opt out of religious observance should be extended to pupils.  Responding to the suggestion a spokesman for the Catholic Church said: \"Current guidance, allowing pupils to express their views on religious observance, allows them to be given an explanation of the advantages of religious education and religious observance, following which many pupils continue to attend.\"  The spokesman said schools would organise \"purposeful work\" for those pupils who still wanted to opt out.  But he added: \"Parents and pupils who wish to opt out on grounds of conscience are advised that, in order not to contradict their wishes, schools will ensure they are not part of any other religious education and religious observance activities such as religiously-motivated charitable fundraising, Nativity play or feast day celebrations. Very few wish to be excluded in this way from the le of the school.\"  The statement provoked an angry backlash from Gordon MacRae, chief executive of the Scottish Humanist Society, who described it as \u0026ldquodisturbing.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis suggests denominational schools coerce or threaten to isolate children and young people from the school community because of their faith or belief.  \"Following such a course of action would put denominational school headteachers in potentially actionable situations and completely distract them from the professional work they do educating pupils and running inclusive school environments.  \"All schools in Scotland, including denominational ones, have a responsibility under law to respect and uphold the independent human right to freedom of religion and belief.\"  Robert Canning, chair of Secular Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe would not agree that children opted out of religious observance, by themselves or their parents, should automatically be excluded from all activities connected with religion, since not all such activities involve worship or prayer.  \"Children acting in Nativity plays are obviously expressing the outlook of the characters and not their own beliefs, and a child might want to be part of a fundraising effort without having the religious motivation that other participants might claim.\"  Professor Paul Braterman, from the Scottish Secular Society, said: \"Parents and pupils should be allowed to decide for themselves regarding matters such as Nativity plays and Feast Day celebrations, on a case-by-case basis.  Meanwhile, teaching unions welcomed the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos intention to incorporate the UN\u0027s convention on children\u0027s rights into Scots Law.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland said the union would support the right of children, at a suitable point in their development, to be able to withdraw from religious assemblies  they wished.  He added: \"We would support children at a suitable point in their development having the right to withdraw  they wish and note that Scottish Government guidance makes it clear that in no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.  \"Under the terms of the Equality Act, schools have a legal duty to prevent discrimination against those who hold particular religious or philosophical beliefs and to actively ensure that they have equal opportunity to participate in the le of the school.  \"To actively exclude children from activities which may be religion-related, but which would not be classied as religious observance, is likely to invite strong legal challenge.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"The existing statutory guidance recognises that when a parent chooses a denominational school ... there is an expectation that they have opted into the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice including activities relating to religious faith and observance.  \"Our guidance also states no pupil should be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawal from religious observance.\"  In Scotland, all young people require parental permission to pull out of religious observance, unlike England and Wales where sixth form pupils \u0026ndash typically aged between 16 and 18 \u0026ndash have the right to opt out.  The law which governs religious observance, originally dating from 1872, has not been updated since 1980 and the latest guidance from the Scottish Government was issued in 2011.  The guidance states: \"Where a parent chooses a denominational school for their child\u0026rsquos education, they choose to opt in to the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice which is imbued with religious faith and religious observance.  \"In denominational schools, it is therefore more dficult to extricate a pupil from all experiences which are influenced by the school\u0026rsquos faith character.  \"Where a pupil is withdrawn from religious observance schools should make suitable arrangements for the pupil to participate in a worthwhile alternative activity. In no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.\""},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-says-any-peoples-vote-should-not-include-option-of-britain-staying-in-eu","story":"  Pro-EU activists\u0027 hopes of the party fully throwing its weight behind a People\u0026rsquos Vote suffered a major setback at Labour\u0027s conference in Liverpool.  More than 100 constituency parties submitted motions demanding a second referendum and thousands of people joined a march calling for a so-called People\u0027s Vote in order to put pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to change course.  But, as expected, after a marathon \u0026ldquocompositing session on Sunday night, the exact wording of the motion to be put to a vote at the party\u0027s conference tomorrow states only that \" we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\".  This is effectively a restatement of the leadership\u0026rsquos position.  However, John McDonnell, a key ally of the party leader, went further this morning by making clear that  there were any second referendum, it should be on whether or not to accept a Brexit deal or conduct fresh negotiations with Brussels rather than seek to reverse the 2016 decision to leave the EU.  The Shadow Chancellor explained: \"We argued for Remain in the past but we lost that vote so we have to respect that. All the polling that we have seen is that the country is still pretty split down the middle.  \u0026ldquoMy big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  it\u0027s slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.\"  He noted how the 2016 poll \"opened up all sorts of xenophobic feelings and a rise of the Right\" and stressed: \"I don\u0027t want to revive Ukip in any way or even the far Right\".  The precise wording of the referendum question would be a matter for Parliament, Mr McDonnell pointed out, telling BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"If we are going to respect the referendum, it[a People\u0027s Vote] will be about the deal.\"  On Good Morning Britain he suggested that a general election would be \"the real People\u0027s Vote\" because it would give the public the chance to change the team carrying out the negotiations, replacing Theresa May with a Labour government.  But he acknowledged the debate at the conference \"may be rumbustious\".  Labour MP David Lammy, a prominent campaigner for a second referendum, was not best pleased, saying it would be \"farcical\" to have a vote without the option of remaining in the EU.  \"A People\u0027s Vote is the only realistic option to save this country from the car crash of Brexit, declared the London MP.  \"No Tory or DUP MP is likely to vote for a general election. Turkeys do not tend to vote for Christmas.\"  He added: \"We\u0027ve now got to turn up the noise until we secure a public vote which gives us the option to remain in the UK.\"  Mr Lammy received support from his Labour colleague and fellow Remainer Chuka Umunna, who called for an \"unequivocal\" commitment to a second referendum with remaining in the EU as an option.  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats said, by ruling out the option of Britain staying in the EU in a second referendum, the Labour leadership was aiding and abetting Theresa May on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove spent two years backing the Tories\u0026rsquo catastrophic Brexit and are even now trying to ignore their own members who want a People\u0026rsquos Vote with the option to remain in the EU.  \u0026ldquoIt beggars belief that McDonnell and Co are spending so much time trying to trick and stitch up their own conference rather than campaigning for an exit from Brexit to protect jobs and services in the UK.

Liberal Democrats demand better than Brexit and want to give the people the final say on any deal through a People\u0027s Vote where they will have the option to remain in the EU.  Eloise Todd of pro-EU Best for Britain said it would be \"unthinkable\" for a second vote not to include the option of Britain staying in the EU and was \"not what the 90 per cent of Labour members who back a public vote would expect\".

Remember this was the one which Tony B changed to entrench New Labour\u0026rsquos commitment to economic dynamism.  \u0026ldquoI say the Clause 4 principles are as relevant today as they were back then, declared Red John. Comrade X shouted: \u0026ldquoYes, yes, yes, and clapped loudly.  The Shadow Chancellor praised the Archbishop of Canterbury - not an everyday occurrence - who got into a spot of bother after calling zero hours contracts \u0026ldquoevil it emerged some Anglican churches were advertising the very same.  Justin Welby got it in the neck from the right-wing press but Red John had some soothing words for the archbish: \u0026ldquoWhen they get round to calling you a Marxist, I\u0026rsquoll give you some tips on how to handle it.  Next up was giving workers a shareholding in their companies and the creation of a social idend to help fund public services. Comrade X hollered his support.  Then came the N-word the nationalisation of water, energy, the Royal Mail and the railways. My neighbour was by now jumping up and down with delight.  After hitting out at the banking fat cats, it was onto Brexit and the chance for Red John to send an electric shock throughout the entire conference hall.  Noting how he was not going to lower expectations, the wannabe Chancellor declared to a wave of applause: \u0026ldquoThe greater the mess we inherit, the more radical we have to be. By now Comrade X needed a glass of water.  But the peak of my neighbour\u0026rsquos enthusiasm was about to be hit when the Labour chief mentioned how the Tories were supposedly drawing up secret plans for a quick general election. \u0026ldquoSo, the message from this conference is, declared Red John: \u0026ldquobring it on!  The electric current shot out from the podium and Comrade X punched the air repeatedly as the conference hall erupted.  After visiting Anfield at the weekend, it was perhaps inevitable that Red John, the son of a Liverpool docker, would go one step further and quote the footballing legend Bill Shankly.  He declared: \u0026ldquoWhenever the General Election comes, we are ready. Ready to campaign for victory, ready for Government, ready to build the future.

If passed, the Bill would flip the current system in towns and cities, where the default limit is generally 30mph, but councils can apply to restrict it to 20mph in specic areas.  Under the proposal, the default limit would instead become 20mph, and councils would have to apply to make it 30mph.  The change would affect the C-class and unclassied local roads which make up around 60 per cent of all UK highways, but not arterial A and B class roads.  The idea has the support of around two dozen MSPs from all the parties at Holyrood bar the Tories, as well as support from the leaders of Glasgow and Edinburgh city councils.  The Scottish Government has not endorsed it, saying it believes councils are best placed to decide speed limits on the local roads they oversee, but will now examine more evidence.  The Bill documents say the expected costs to councils, principally signage, would be around \u0026pound22m, based on previous small-scale roll-outs.  However a 10% fall in accidents could save the public purse close to \u0026pound40m in police, NHS and economic costs, and previous trials have seen a 20% fall in accidents and fatalities.  People are seven times less likely to die  hit by a vehicle travelling at 20 rather than 30mph.  Campaigners for the change also say it would help reduce pollution and encourage more people to walk and cycle, because they would feel less threatened by traffic speeds.  Mr Ruskell said that  the Bill received strong support at Holyrood is could become law by the end of 2019, then phased in after a further 18 months.  He said: \"As a local councillor and as an MSP I have seen first-hand the frustration of communities that want lower speed limits but find the current process overly-complicated.  \u0026ldquoBy making 20 the norm in built-up areas we can end this frustration and provide the clarity that residents and motorists deserve.  Mark Beaumont, who became the fastest round-the-world cyclist by cycling 18,000 miles in under 79 days, said: \"It\u0027s great to see Mark Ruskell\u0027s bill in the Scottish Parliament helping build the momentum on this issue and I hope we see it become law in the near future. This is about saving lives, reducing injuries and improving public health and enjoyment by making our streets safer and healthier places to cycle and walk.  \u0026ldquoThe current system of patchwork 20mph zones is time-consuming and costly for local councils, and confusing for road users. Scotland has a real chance to take a lead on this so let\u0026rsquos go for it.  Emilia Hanna of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: \u0026ldquo20mph zones make our streets safer and fairer for everyone using them, and are a vital part of the solution to air pollution.  \u0026ldquoThe faster people drive, the greater the risk of accidents, and the more off-putting it is for people to walk and cycle. Cars dominate our streets far too much already.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be a much more level playing field between pedestrians, cyclists, public transport users and drivers. Slowing traffic is a key way to achieve this.  But Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: \u0026ldquoTo take drivers along with them the authorities need to explain not only what they are doing to improve safety but also how the changes will make people\u0026rsquos journeys smoother and more reliable.  \u0026ldquoThere will be many urban roads in Scotland where, given the congestion, drivers couldn\u0026rsquot get up to 20 mph even  they were allowed to.  from Neil Grieg, Director of Policy and Research at IAM Roadsmart, said: \u0026ldquoAll roads dfer in their form and  at a very detailed level and the limit should reflect that.  \u0026ldquoThis is why IAM RoadSmart does not favour a blanket approach to speed limits or a wholesale change in the urban limit from 30 to 20.  \u0026ldquoIf you want to change driver behaviour you need to spend more and change the character of the road. That means more high quality surfacing and shared space. Drivers will get the message and share the road even more safely than they do already.  A spokesperson for government quango Transport Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe are clear that 20 mile per hour speed limits are a good idea when implemented in the right environment.  \u0026ldquoGiven the ied nature of Scotland\u0027s urban road network and the number of factors which need considered when setting appropriate limits, we believe decisions on 20 mph speed limits are best taken at the local authority level.  \u0026ldquoThe Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity met with Mark Ruskell MSP regarding his plans to bring forward a Member\u0026rsquos Bill on 20 mph speed limits and we look forward to seeing the detail of any legislative proposals submitted to Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"back-in-the-frame-national-gallery-of-scotland-re-boot-scheme-with-21m-plan-to-open-in-2021","story":"  Now priced at \u0026pound22m, up for the previous estimate of just under \u0026pound17m, the National Galleries of Scotland are to begin a major revamp of the key gallery in the centre of Edinburgh.  The troubled project was put on a \"pause\" last March when it was facing spiralling costs, many posed by the complex site: on a hill, in a major public park, under a listed building and close to a major railway line.  Now the galleries  have unveiled a new conception of the revamp, which will create new galleries for the display of Scottish art, and a complete rehang of the gallery space.  It will open in early 2021.  : When Galleries pressed \u0027pause\u0027 on revamp project  The galleries have long wanted to change the display of Scottish art at the National Gallery, which for many years was shown in a \"cramped and dark\" concrete basement.  Work will begin in October, and the NGS say that the galleries will remain open throughout the redevelopment project.  However, to enable excavation works to the galleries directly beneath, the notable Playfair Steps, at the rear of the National Gallery, will be closed for the duration of the building work.  The Playfair Steps, designed by William Henry Playfair, are an historic steep flight of steps from the Mound to Market Street, and are often busy, especially during the Festival.  The new galleries, with large windows running the  of the new Princes Street Gardens facade, will have a \"broader\" look at Scottish art, and will open in 2021.  : Stop and start history of landmark revamp project  They will feature the art of Allan Ramsay, Gavin Hamilton and Sir David Wilkie, as well as 20th century artists such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Stanley Cursiter and the Scottish Colourists S J Peploe and F C B Cadell.  The plan will involve \"extensive new landscaping in the gardens\", as well as a larger shop, and a new cafe.  The galleries say that once open, they will have a \"dedicate family day\" one daya a week, and more volunteers working in the galleries.  The first sign of the revamp will be construction work in October, followed by a new coffee shop at Christmas, and new steps and paths by next spring.  Funds for the revamp are from the National Lottery, worth \u0026pound4.9m, and the Scottish Government, worth \u0026pound5,5, as well as signicant fund raising.  : Director previously hoped for 2020 re-opening  Sir John Leighton, director-general of the National Galleries of Scotland, said: \"This is a hugely exciting time for us, as we see our ambitious plans for the Scottish National Gallery getting underway.  \"We will create the perfect showcase for the nation\u0026rsquos extraordinary collection of Scottish art, giving it room to breathe and showing it off with real pride to the world.  \"This ambitious project will completely transform the experience of our visitors, creating a National Gallery that is even more open, engaging and inviting with new presentations of Scotland\u0026rsquos art in a setting that will be truly world-class.\"  Dr Tricia Allerston, co-director of the Scottish National Gallery Project, said that visitor numbers to the Scottish National Gallery have almost \"doubled in the past ten years but fewer than one in six of them made their way to the cramped, dark spaces which used to house the national collection of Scottish art.\"  She added: \"Soon, visitors will be able easily to discover, appreciate and enjoy our highly signicant collections of Scottish art through a series of innovative displays designed expressly to engage them.  \"Imagine looking at a painting of Sir Walter Scott and then looking out of the windows into Princes Street Gardens, a landscape created during his letime and which is now dominated by the great monument marking his international fame.\"  : Sir John Leighton on national gallery\u0026nbsprevamp plans  The designs for the revamp are by Hoskins Architects.  The main entrance will be to Princes Street Gardens.  Aside from a short period in early 2019, the Mound precinct will remain open, and events such as the Christmas market will go ahead as scheduled.  Lucy Casot, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a hugely exciting time for Scotland\u0026rsquos arts and cultural heritage with the recent openings of Mackintosh at the Willow and the V\u0026ampA Dundee and now the beginning of a wonderful new gallery, none of which would be possible without funds from the National Lottery playing public.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour-divisions-over-second-vote-on-brexit-flare-up","story":"  Yesterday, the party\u0026rsquos rt over a so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote was laid bare after John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, insisted that Remain would not be part of any question put to voters in any second referendum. Later, Sir Keir insisted it would be.  And in his keynote speech the Shadow Brexit Secretary again claimed the possibility of Britain retaining its membership of the EU in future public not only had to remain an option in another referendum but no-one, including Mr McDonnell, was ruling it out.  However, during an at times passionate debate on Brexit, Steve Turner, Assistant General Secretary of Unite the union, told delegates that  the Tories were not brave enough to call a general election, then Labour would \u0026ldquodemand they go back to the people with a vote on the deal.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThat is not in a second referendum, despite what Keir Starmer may have said earlier, it will be a public vote, that\u0026rsquos a vote on the terms of our departure.  Len McCluskey, the union\u0026rsquos leader, has made clear that he believes the 2016 Brexit vote should stand and there should not be a rerun to keep Britain in the EU. He too wants to see a general election to get rid of Theresa May\u0026rsquos Conservative Government.  In his conference address, Sir Keir made clear the party was set to vote against the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Brexit plan when it was put to a Commons vote and that a general election should be triggered  she were unable to win Westminster\u0026rsquos approval.  As he went through the key passage, delegates regularly applauded ious sections and at one point around two-thirds of delegates rose to their feet.  The Shadow Secretary of State argued that  Labour could not secure a general election, then \"we must have other options that must include campaigning for a public vote\".  He went on: \"It is right that Parliament has the first say but,  we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.\"  Sir Keir\u0027s comments departed from the text of his speech and was at odds with Mr McDonnell\u0026rsquos view.  But, earlier, the Shadow Brexit Secretary sought to play down the split, claiming it did not exist and that the Shadow Chancellor\u0026rsquos initial assessment could be put down to having been \"up early\" for his interviews on Monday, just hours after Labour\u0027s policy motion was thrashed out in Sunday night\u0027s marathon meeting.  Explaining Labour\u0027s strategy for the looming Commons showdown on whatever deal Mrs May brought back from Brussels, Sir Keir said there was \"ision, chaos, failure\" under her premiership and \"the Government has no credible plan for Brexit, weeks out from the deadline\".  He told conference: \"The Tory civil war on Europe that has been going on for years now risks our prosperity.  \"The party that once promised that it would fix the roof while the sun was shining is now intent on burning the whole house down, declared Sir Keir.  \"So, I\u0027ve got a message for the Prime Minister:  your party wants to tear itself apart, that\u0027s fine\u0026hellip but you\u0027re not taking our country with you.\"  He noted that it was \"increasingly likely\" that whatever plan Mrs May brought back to the Commons would fail to meet Labour\u0027s tests for a Brexit agreement and  so \"we would vote against her deal\".  Labour would also vote down a \"vague\" deal, a so-called \"blind Brexit\" that did not spell out details of the future relationship.  \"This is not about frustrating the process it is about stopping a destructive Tory Brexit,\" insisted Sir Keir.  He refused to accept that the only option available  Mrs May\u0027s plan were voted down was a no-deal Brexit.  \"No deal would be a catastrophe and no government has the right to plunge our country into chaos because of their own failures,\" declared the Labour frontbencher.  Under the terms of the motion set to be voted on late this afternoon,  Labour could not force an early general election, it would \"support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\".  The possibility of another referendum after 17.4 million voted to leave the EU has led to fears of civil unrest and the rise of far-right politics.  But Sir Keir said that that could be avoided and the party had a responsibility to save the UK from leaving without a deal.  Ahead of his speech, he told BBC Radio 5 Live a no-deal Brexit would \"rupture our trading arrangements and this will cost jobs, I don\u0027t doubt that the pound will begin to drop\".  The Shadow Brexit Secretary explained: \"We won\u0027t have any arrangements for security and counter-terrorism - I worked, when I was director of public prosecutions, on counter-terrorism work across Europe - the idea that we wouldn\u0027t have an arrangement in place for that would horry people,\" he said.  \"And, frankly, this idea that we might have medicines stockpiled for six weeks has spooked people.  \"We don\u0027t want to face that situation and we have got a duty to do something to stop it and that\u0027s why the option of a public vote is important as something that may have to happen when we get to that stage.\"  Acknowledging the sensitivity of the issue, Sir Keir said: \"We have to manage it in a sensible way but we have to accept we are only having this discussion because of the failure of the talks.\"  Labour\u0027s position leaves the PM brutally exposed to a rebellion by restive Tory backbenchers, with fewer than a dozen able to fracture her fragile control of the Commons in the upcoming vote.  The Shadow Brexit Secretary confirmed talks were taking place with potential rebels, telling the BBC: \"If we get to that stage this autumn, most MPs would be prepared to say: \u0027We need to do something to prevent us crashing out of the EU without a deal.\u0026rsquo\"  In response to his conference speech, Eloise Todd for the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: \"Keir Starmer\u0027s speech has put staying in the EU firmly on the table.  \u0026ldquoAfter an unprecedented grassroots effort mainly from Corbyn\u0026rsquos supporters, Labour look set to back a public vote should an election not happen. The delegates should listen to the standing ovation that accompanied Keir\u0026rsquos words and confirm the motion this afternoon.  Gerard Batten, the UKip leader, said: \u0026ldquoKeir Starmer is another member of the Remainer elite who thinks he knows better than the people. I will remind him that five million Labour voters also voted for Brexit.  \"Labour, Liberal or Tory, it\u0027s clear that  people want Brexit, then they will have to vote for UKIP at the next General Election.\"  Stephen Gethins for the SNP said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time for Labour to stop playing games and finally nail its colours to the mast with a genuine alternative to a Tory extreme Brexit.  \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos shameless \u0026lsquoman without a plan\u0026rsquo political posturing is simply not good enough. It is a total absence of leadership on the biggest issue facing the country and it shows Labour is not fit for opposition let alone government.  The party\u0026rsquos Europe spokesman went on: \u0026ldquoUnbelievably, Labour still appear to back the harmful fundamentals of a Tory hard Brexit dragging Scotland out of the EU against its will and causing huge damage to jobs and the economy by taking the whole of the UK out of the single market and customs union, which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.  The Fe MP added: \u0026ldquoWith just six months to go before the UK crashes out of the EU, it is staggering that Labour have failed to outline a clear alternative to the Tories and continue to pursue a reckless path that they know will destroy jobs, damage businesses, and inflict lasting harm on the incomes and living standards of millions of people\u0026hellip  \u0026ldquoIt is time Labour ditched their support for a Tory hard Brexit and joined the SNP in standing up for the interests of the country.  Brandon Lewis, the Conservative Chairman, said: \u0026ldquoKeir Starmer has confirmed Labour would break their promises and take us back to square one on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIn the space of one morning, he has refused to rule out delaying Brexit, refused to confirm Labour would end freedom of movement, and opened the door to staying in the EU with a second referendum. Labour\u0026rsquos promises on Brexit aren\u0026rsquot worth the paper they\u0026rsquore written on.  \u0026ldquoLabour can\u0026rsquot deliver the change the British people voted for and it\u0026rsquos only the Conservatives who have a plan to take back control of our laws, borders and money, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"leonard-pledges-land-reform-to-end-dominance-of-feudal-private-landlords","story":"  The Scottish Labour leader in his keynote conference speech also made clear his party in power would give more state aid to Scottish businesses instead of foreign-owned companies.  The self-styled Corbynista insisted that society should \u0026ldquostop iding people on the basis of nationality and start uniting them on the basis of class.  He insisted the \u0026ldquoreal ision in Britain was not between Scotland and England but between the wealth owners and the wealth creators.  Deriding the Tories\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquofervent devotion to inequality and the Nationalists\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquotimidity and mediocrity, the Central Scotland MSP said it was time for \"moral courage and audacity\" from Labour and proposed a wealth tax on Scotland\u0026rsquos wealthiest 10 per cent, which, he calculated, would raised \u0026pound3.7 billion for public services.  On land reform, he said Labour had unfinished business and that after abolishing feudalism in the first term of the Scottish Parliament the nation was still living with \u0026ldquofeudal ownership with 432 private landowners owning half of privately-owned land in Scotland.  Describing the earth as a \u0026ldquocommon treasure, he insisted what was needed was land ownership in Scotland for the many and not the few.  A Scottish Labour government would introduce a new Land Reform Act to break up the dominance of private landowners and will look at the possibility of introducing a tax on land value, capping the amount on landowners\u0026rsquo beneficial interest and a residential requirement on absentee landowners.  Mr Leonard also pledged to overhaul state aid for business, Regional Selective Assistance[RSA], to provide more support for local industries and home-grown businesses after the crisis with marine energy company BiFab, which left communities facing ruin as hundreds of workers were threatened with redundancy earlier this year.  He party leader stressed how reform of RSA would prevent foreign-owned companies continuing to benefit from nearly twice as much RSA than Scottish companies.

And so it goes on \u0026hellip and on \u0026hellip until Judgement Day.  The sprawl of referenda facing us makes the map of New York\u0026rsquos subway system seem understandable. Labour members want a second referendum, a People\u0026rsquos Vote, on the Brexit deal, which may, or may not, include a question about staying in the EU. However, Labour won\u0026rsquot allow Scotland to have a second independence referendum. How does that work? A second referendum on the EU is okay, but not a second referendum on independence? That\u0026rsquos a straight-up fail in logic class.  Then we come to the SNP \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a big push for the First Minister to back a second People\u0026rsquos Vote, but she\u0026rsquos not committing. That\u0026rsquos probably because the party is committed to a second Scottish independence referendum \u0026ndash although, when that might be, we don\u0026rsquot know \u0026ndash and some worry a People\u0026rsquos Vote will set the precedent that a future independence referendum can be overturned.  But that doesn\u0026rsquot make sense either. If pro-independence folk push for a second independence referendum, then why shouldn\u0026rsquot Unionists push for a third in the event the No side loses, or push for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on any independence \u0026ldquodeal? If you want a second indyref, then why not back a second EU vote? Why not a third vote on Brexit called by the Brexiters  they lose a People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash why not just keep going until I have grandchildren in middle age? Why not just keep going until we are all driven stark staring mad?  We\u0026rsquore now playing referendum Jenga \u0026ndash piling up phoney choice on phoney choice in a rickety tower that cannot stay stable, and it\u0026rsquos democracy which is at risk of tumbling down.  I spit my curse on referenda not because of sour grapes \u0026ndash my side got beaten in two votes. I support Scottish independence, and I support remaining in Europe. I spit my curse on referenda because I see more of them coming in the future, and  we think we\u0026rsquore ided and unhappy now, wait and see how we feel when we\u0026rsquove been through one or two or three more.  Let\u0026rsquos stick with losers like me for a moment. We got beaten 45-55 over independence and 48-52 over Europe. Look at those margins. In Scotland, 45 per cent of the population were left with their dreams crushed. In the UK, 48 per cent had their world pulled from under them. Should 55 per cent of the population have the right to leave 45 per cent sitting in the corner crying? Should 52 per cent have the power to trash the house of the other 48 per cent?  This is the tyranny of the majority \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquove long been thinking about what it would have been like  the shoe was on the other foot. I hope I would have felt empathy for a defeated Unionist or a Brexiter. Their political positions are not wicked \u0026ndash both are legitimate, decent opinions to hold \u0026ndash but the binary black and white of referenda puts the boot well and truly into the face of empathy. No-one walks in another person\u0026rsquos shoes when it comes to a referendum, you steal their shoes, tie their laces together and fling them over a telegraph pole in spite.  It may sound crazy given the public mood, it may even sound anti-democratic, for which I ask forgiveness, but perhaps this whole clunking winner-takes-all referenda path we\u0026rsquore on is deeply damaging to democracy. No matter what side of the fence you sit on \u0026ndash pro-independence, pro-Union pro-Europe, anti-Europe \u0026ndash you cannot say that the choices we\u0026rsquove made and the way those choices have been acted upon has been beneficial to the common good. It\u0026rsquos a bitter mess from Caithness to Cornwall.  Would it be better  referenda were settled with a 60-40 win? At least then the utter crushing of the losing side would not be so deadly and isive. If 60 per cent of the population told me I was wrong over independence and Europe, then perhaps it would have been more palatable. When Yes lost I felt as  a dream had evaporated because I was looking to the future \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost what I never had. When the Brexiters won I was bereft as I felt part of my identity had been stolen \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost something very tangible. Pull a switcheroo, and imagine that Yes won, or Brexiters lost, and you can see the same unhappiness across the ide: Unionists robbed of identity, anti-European dreams dashed.  But the ghost is out of the bottle. We can\u0026rsquot stop this chain reaction of referendum leading to referendum, nor can we tweak the rules \u0026ndash once we\u0026rsquove started down this path the road must remain level. So, on we will go, vote after vote, a slim minority of people hurt and thrust into the cold, a slim majority gloating in victory \u0026hellip until calls for new votes start again.  This is a Naked Lunch moment \u0026ndash a frozen moment when everyone sees exactly what is on the end of their fork. What I see is that we\u0026rsquove embraced endless ision, that we\u0026rsquore happy to hurt the other side on an existential level, that we cannot empathise with those who hold dfering political views \u0026ndash and that is because we brought in the blind god of referenda to stand in place of the slow grind of discussion.

The ruling party has long been making noises that Scotland - and an independent Scotland in particular - needs an influx of working-age immigrants to keep its economy afloat, and earlier this year it made the case for Scotland taking control of its own borders regardless of whether it remains part of the UK or not.  The bid has met with a mixed response from the public, with respected pollster Sir John Curtice finding in January that 63 per cent of Scots wanted to keep the same immigration rules as the UK, while a report issued last week by the National Conversation on Immigration suggested that practically the same proportion  now back immigration devolution.  Part of the reason for the flip-flopping is likely to do with the focus on the benefits immigration brings to the economy as a whole, with little attention given to how it impacts on us inidually. Yet you only need to look at the state pension, a benefit every one of us should expect to receive sooner or later, to see the dference greater immigration could make.  It is no secret that Scotland has a rapidly ageing population and in its Sustainable Growth Commission report the SNP noted that while the country\u0026rsquos pensioner population is expected to grow by 28% in the next 25 years the working-age population will grow by just 1%. This matters because, contrary to popular opinion, our tax and national insurance contributions are not being collected in inidual state-pension pots to be paid out on retirement, but rather are being used to fund current pensioners\u0026rsquo monthly payments, just as future generations\u0026rsquo taxes will be used to pay ours. It also matters in the context of the independence debate because in the UK as a whole the pensioner population is expected to grow by 33% and the working-age population by 11%, meaning the need for increased immigration, while still there, is less pressing.  The implication of this is clear: without a marked increase in the working-age population, an independent Scotland would be unable to continue paying the state pension - a benefit we should all be entitled to in some shape or form \u0026ndash without taking drastic, and electorally unpopular, action such as increasing taxes or raising the retirement age.  We all know how popular the former idea is, and the UK Government\u0026rsquos plan to press ahead with the latter has met with signicant opposition north of the Border due to le expectancy in some parts of Scotland being so low. Increasing immigration, and so the tax take, would have the potential to negate the need for doing either.  Of course this is all moot for now, with a Home Office-commissioned report issued last week by the independent Migration Advisory Committee concluding that \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is [not] sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  There will be some in the yes campaign that say this only strengthens the argument for independence, but the problem is that those shouting loudest for a second referendum appear to be the least likely to embrace an increase in immigration on any scale, let alone the scale an independent Scotland would require in order to thrive.  It should come as no surprise that there exists a scepticism towards incomers when a hard-core of indy supporters so vocally hanker after a country that is ours alone. Indeed, ahead of the 2014 independence referendum St Andrews academic David McCollum led a study that found \u0026ldquoevidence of some  hostility towards migration on the part of the general public in Scotland and a possible link between nationalist leanings and opposition to \u0026lsquoOthers\u0026rsquo. This opposition appears to have crystallised into the backward-looking \u0026lsquothis land is our land-ism\u0026rsquo of the kind of die-hard secessionist who believes that screening Mel Gibson\u0026rsquos Braveheart at a rally will strengthen the indy cause.  Regardless of political stance, as an electorate we are always asked to make binary decisions - him or her, red or blue, in or out, yes or no - when the implications of those decisions are anything but black and white. In the normal course of events backing the wrong horse doesn\u0026rsquot matter too much because another election will always come along to let you change your mind. With referendums, however, the decision is far more binding, meaning voters will have to sacrice some of their beliefs in favour of other, more palatable ones.  While some in the electorate may have independence at the top of their wish list and will do anything to get the chance to vote for it, the truth is that  immigration is not up there with it then even the staunchest of independentistas would be better off sticking with the UK, in all its Brexity glory."},{"url":null,"title":"turning-glasgow-on-to-health-benefits-of-vegetables","story":"  A lack of fruit and vegetables in our diet has been identied as one of the major causes of serious illness, yet Glasgow\u0026rsquos consumption of vegetables in some areas is falling at an alarming rate.

The proposals are part of a five-point plan to revive town centres and stem their decline following the dficulties faced by a string of major retailers.  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, said: \"Our high streets need saving from a slow and agonising death.  \"As part of our plan to rebuild Britain and breathe le back into our communities, Labour will scrap ATM charges, deliver free WiFi to town centres, introduce a register of empty properties, provide free bus travel for under 25s and overhaul the broken business rates system which is hammering retail.  \"Boarded-up shops and deserted high streets are a result of years of neglect and austerity. Our country needs to radically change course so our towns can thrive again,\" she told conference.  The high street has been battered this year by several high-profile retail administrations and store closure programmes.  House of Fraser, Maplin and Toys R Us have all gone bust, while New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare have shut stores.  Meanwhile, on the issue of cash machines, there have been widespread closures of ATMs with cuts to funding resulting in the loss of thousands of machines rural areas and Scotland have been the worst affected.  Labour pointed out how the number of people who relied almost entirely on cash had risen to 2.7 million, up by 500,000 over the last two years.  Research by Which?, it said, had shown that the loss of free-to-use ATMs would leave one in 10 people struggling to make payments, forcing consumers out from local shops and services.  Labour analysis has found that in the last three years alone 100,000 jobs in the retail sector have been lost. British Retail Consortium research also shows that a fth of British retailers are planning to cut the number of people they employ in the next three months.  Scottish Labour MP Ged Killen, who has been campaigning to maintain ATMs, said he welcomes his party\u0026rsquos commitment to ban ATM charges and ensure people could access their own cash for free.  \u0026ldquoIn Scotland, a free-to-use ATM is closing at a rate of one a day, he declared.  \u0026ldquoThis means every day a there is one less place to take out money for the school lunches or one less place to withdraw money to pay in local shops, noted the Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP.  \u0026ldquoNo one should have to pay to access their own money.

Delegates chanted \"Free Palestine\" as a motion condemning the Israeli response to protests in the Gaza Strip was moved by Colin Monehen from Harlow CLP.  He said an \"army\" would be needed to remove him from the stage, prompting cheers and claps from many in the audience, after he was told his speaking time was up.  He said: \"If you want me off this stage, you\u0027re going to have to get security up here and they better send an army, because Eastenders, like Palestinians, don\u0027t go down easy.\"  Mr Monehen said the Palestinian people could not be \"left alone in the darkness\", saying their story \"must be told\".  He went on: \"I want us to send a message to Mr Trump that cutting the funding to the UNRWA, the humanitarian agency set up by the UN to assist these people in exile, born homeless, born stateless, in refugee camps, will not crush their spirit.  \"It will not lessen their resolve to  home. Expelling Palestinian diplomats will not make them disappear like a snowflake in the hot sun,\" added Mr Monehen.  The debate happened after the Labour leader threw his support behind a two-state solution to Middle East peace, saying he wanted a \"secure and viable\" Palestine alongside Israel.  Addressing the Labour Friends of Palestine conference fringe event, he attacked Donald Trump for moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and cutting funding for the UN Refugee Agency.  He also called for a \"sustainable, just peace\" with Israel after \"51 years of occupation\".  Mr Corbyn went on: \"But peace cannot be achieved with the existence of settlements, human rights abuses, and a disregard for international law by the current Israeli government, like last Sunday\u0027s demolition of the Palestinian village of Khan Al Amar.  \"The security of one country can never be achieved at the expense of another and Britain has historic responsibility towards Palestinian people, declared the party leader.  He added: \"We will continue to stand up for Palestinians, we will recognise an independent state of Palestine as soon as we take office.\"  At the same fringe meeting, Ms Thornberry echoed the party leader, saying an independent Palestine was needed, \"while there is still some Palestine left to recognise\".

Almost one in five  of those living in the worst off areas had been worried about running out of food over the last year \u0026ndash with 21% of single parents reporting this as a concern.  The findings from the 2017 Scottish Health Survey, which for the first time included questions on food insecurity, also found 7% ate less than they should and 4% did run out of food.  Earlier this year calls to top up child benefit by \u0026pound5 a week and lt 30,000 youngsters out of poverty were rejected yesterday by the Scottish Government.  Campaigners had wanted the SNP to write the measure into new social security laws, using newly devolved powers.  But in a vote the party rejected Labour\u0026rsquos amendment.    Scottish Greens health spokesperson Alison Johnstone MSP said it was time for the Scottish Government to rethink their refusal to top-up Child Benefit.  \"It\u0026rsquos appalling that in wealthy 21st century Scotland we have so many people either worrying about running out of food due to lack of money or actually going hungry because they\u0026rsquore strapped for cash,\" she said \"The impact of poor nutrition on people\u0026rsquos physical and mental health is well understood, and it\u0026rsquos particularly detrimental to children\u0026rsquos development.  \"I hope in light of the new findings on food insecurity SNP Ministers think again about a \u0026pound5-a-week top-up of Child Benefit and finish the job on mitigating the Benefit Cap, to ensure families no longer go hungry.

The survey found 8% of adults had experienced food insecurity in 2017, with this defined as being a worry they would run out of food because of financial problems.  This affected one in five  adults aged 16 to 64 who were living alone.  The report said there was a \u0026ldquosignicant association between area deprivation and food insecurity in 2017, noting that 18% of those in the most deprived areas had been worried about running out of food at some point in the last 12 months, compared to 3% of people in the least deprived areas.  Charities Oxfam Scotland, the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, Nourish Scotland and The Poverty Alliance joined forces to set up A Menu for Change \u0026ndash a project aimed at tackling food insecurity and poverty.  Policy officer Mary Anne MacLeod said: \u0026ldquoThese statistics paint a grim picture of hunger across the country. Given Scotland isn\u0026rsquot facing a food shortage, this is clearly a problem of widespread poverty.  \u0026ldquoThe figures show 16 to 44 year olds are most likely to be going hungry.

Responses will feed into a new waste strategy being developed, aimed at ensuring the area maximises the environmental, local and financial benefits from the waste it produces as a community.Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate is 43.5%, but services currently available to residents should allow a recycling rate of over 70%. Over half of the materials put into local non-recyclable waste bins are actually recyclable through existing services – equating to around 30,000 tonnes of recyclable materials being binned at a cost of £3.5million a year.Sending waste to landfill costs twice as much as recycling, so not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other council services.

Fresh from another incredible month of spectacular performances at the world-renowned Edinburgh Tattoo, Scotland’s State Band, as it is also known, will be performing at the Beach Ballroom on Friday, September 28.                                                     Members of the band local to the area recently joined Aberdeen Provost Barney Crockett and the Poppyscotland team to spread the word about the eagerly anticipated concert.        Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.                                                                                                         Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online. However, Ms Oag believes it is leading to a surge in the number of abandoned and ill-treated animals.\"It\u0027s not fair on them to be sold alongside kids\u0027 bikes and unused furniture,\" she said. \"Too many people are just not taking responsibility.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusTuesday 25 Sep 2018 7:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117685.jpg","title":"Wind turbine blades hold up town traffic","story":"\u0026nbspMOTORISTS making their way through Wick faced a delay as an extra-long convoy of trucks set out for Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm on the Causewaymire.Three giant blades each measuring 45 metres were driven up from Wick harbour by lorries from Campbeltown-based McFadyens with an escort of the company\u0027s support vehicles. Because of the sharp turn from River Street up the Clf Road the lorries are required to reverse all the way up from Wick harbour after the blades are loaded on their trailers by crane. They then negotiate the turn up the Clf from River Street and can proceed as normal.All possible obstacles are temporarily repositioned and in the case of River Street this means folding over a hinged lamp-post so the blade tip doesn\u0027t hit it as the lorry turns.The three McFadyens trucks were monitored by the company\u0027s support vehicles and road policing officers.The Senvion MM92 turbine comes in eight pieces that the haulage company conveys to the site in convoys that never go beyond three lorries.Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm, which began construction in March 2017, will feature 13 of these 2.05MW turbines with a tip height of 112 metres.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 7:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 25, 2018 at 2:05 pmIn the same week that the Men\u0026#8217s Shed movement is being celebrated internationally with Men\u0026#8217s Shed Week, Orkney Men’s Shed  will mark one year since it opened its doors this coming Saturday.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, 128 tonnes of plastic bottles are incinerated every year.Here in Orkney, OIC\u0026#8217s waste team will be carrying out a number of activities including a drop-in at Tesco on Monday, visits to local schools, as well as sharing recycling information and tips on its Facebook and Twitter feeds.The team will be also be encouraging local people to take part in the Scottish Government’s national consultation on a deposit  scheme on disposable drinks containers for Scotland.OIC’s project coordination manager for waste, Jayne Venables, believes that small improvements in Orkney’s recycling rates could make a huge dference.She says for every one per cent extra material that is recycled, the council can save up to £12,500 on waste disposal costsIain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland added: “Recycle Week is the ideal opportunity to do more to make sure we’re recycling as much as we can. We all use plastic bottles in our daily routines — from shampoo and shower gel, to cleaning products —which can all be widely recycled, and it doesn’t take long to do.\u0026#8221You can also follow activity and share messages throughout the week on the Eco Active Orkney and/or OIC updates Facebook pages or using #RecycleWeekScot on Twitter.More information on deposit  and Recycling Week is available on the Zero Waste Scotland website at: www.zerowastescotland.org.uk\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor. Normally I\u0026rsquom sceptical about these sort of competitions but this has been great. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity for everyone to take a look at what they\u0026rsquore doing. There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 7:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part.

It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgTuesday 25 Sep 2018 7:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804970.1537873330!/image/image.jpg","title":"life expectancy in scotland decreases for first time","story":"        Growth in le expectancy in the UK has come to a halt - and has decreased in Scotland for the first time, new figures show.

While only 1% of people living in the most affluent communities reported having nothing left to eat in the previous 12 months, new figures on food insecurity showed this increased to 10% in the most deprived areas.            Almost a fth  of those living in the worst off areas had been worried about running out of food over the last year - with 21% of single parents reporting this as a concern.            The findings emerged from the 2017 Scottish Health Survey, which for the first time included questions on food insecurity.Campaigners said the results “paint a grim picture of hunger across the country”, adding the problem was due to “widespread poverty”.Almost 3,700 adults and just over 1,600 children across Scotland took part in the 2017 survey - with the findings showing increased consumption of fruit and vegetables.Almost a quarter  of adults ate the recommended five portions a day, the highest total since 2003 - although the figures also showed that 10% had not consumed any fruit or vegetables on the day prior to the survey being carried out.But on average adults in Scotland consumed 3.3 portions of fruit or vegetables, against the highest since 2003, with children 2.9 portions on average - the best since 2008.            The survey found 8% of adults had experienced food insecurity in 2017, with this defined as being a worry they would run out of food because of financial problems.This affected one in five  adults aged 16 to 64 who were living alone, while 7% of Scots reported eating less than they should because of money worries, and one in 25  running out of food at some point in the last year. - Le expectancy in Scotland decreases for first timeThe problem was worst among younger Scots, with 6% of those aged 16 to 44 running out of food, compared to less than 0.5% of those who were 65 or older.            Meanwhile 18% of single adults living alone and single parents said they had eaten less than they should at some point over the past year because of their finances.The report said there was a “signicant association between area deprivation and food insecurity in 2017”, noting that while 18% of those in the most deprived areas had been worried about running out of food at some point in the last 12 months, compared to 3% of people in the least deprived areas.Charities Oxfam Scotland, the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, Nourish Scotland and The Poverty Alliance joined forces to set up A Menu for Change - a project aimed at tackling food insecurity and poverty.Policy officer Mary Anne MacLeod said: “These statistics paint a grim picture of hunger across the country. Given Scotland isn’t facing a food shortage, this is clearly a problem of widespread poverty.“The figures show 16 to 44 year olds are most likely to be going hungry.

Rather than graty him by repeatedly referring to his meanderings, I’ll use them as a jump-off point to explain why ­Brian Beacom’s rant is not only unhelpful to women, but also to discussion about the other side of the gender coin: masculinity.            In this age of growing awareness of the myriad challenges many women face, I am trying to reason as honestly and openly as I can. I feel it is my responsibility to look beyond the first emotional impulse on any given issue and try to see the bigger picture.             Admittedly, this hasn’t been an easy road, and especially true where gender is ­concerned. It took me a long time to reconcile the ­personal experience of feeling frightened by women as a kid with the political and cultural reality that many of the challenges, prejudices and threats women face are – like many of the roles assigned to them by society – a direct result of their gender. The notion that so many ­women feel powerless, threatened or afraid was hard to map onto my own experience, where women always appeared to be in charge – sometimes ruling with an iron fist. Realising the personal and political are not mutually exclusive has been bumpy and sometimes frightening. In the age of social media it requires almost no effort to be extremely uncharitable, whether dishing it out or on the receiving end. Beacom makes a mockery of those of us who are grappling with matters of gender and masculinity, sometimes counterintuitively. It takes a lot of work  to resist hardwired reactions to a cascade of conflicting social media posts, blogs, articles and news stories. Where, often, men are discussed in generalities that do not account for the specicity of our experiences and where we are often commanded to “talk about our feelings” and “stop making it all about us” simultaneously. It was hard for me to accept, for example, that my mother’s aggression and violence towards me was, as I have heard it said, simply another form of toxic masculinity – that her abusive behaviour was rooted in trauma she experienced at the hands of men when she was a young woman. I had a lot of baggage to unpack and as I did so, much of it on public platforms, I was accosted on occasion. Sometimes my assailants had a point. Sometimes that point was drowned out by social media hyperbole. Ironically, the people who were most helpful, compassionate and understanding were other feminists who valued a willingness to ­examine my own attitudes and behaviour over a carefully constructed avatar that always knew the wokest thing to say.I licked my wounds and kept going. All around me I could see once powerful men being recontextualised as predators and abusers. One thing they all had in common was a seemingly sincere belief that they had done nothing wrong. It struck me that, just because I didn’t regard myself as ever harming, harassing or abusing anybody, this didn’t automatically mean I hadn’t. But this is a dficult thing to confront, especially in the public domain, when you are caught in the crossfire between two types of men who are always engaged in the ­discussion around gender.            In one corner, we have the woke bros. They are a good lot. They use whatever means available to echo the sentiments expressed by progressive women. They observe the day’s contested gender story through a feminist lens and are keen to be seen publicly standing in solidarity with whatever their comrades think. You’ll find them right across the political spectrum and, ostensibly, they were born with all the correct opinions and attitudes installed – because we never hear how they came to be so woke. Also, you rarely hear anything from them about their experiences as men, in relation to women. Nothing about what they struggle with, or those attitudes and behaviours in their private lives that haven’t always so conveniently aligned with their public proclamations. Apparently, we are to believe these guys have never intruded on a woman’s privacy out of emotional insecurity, never gratied themselves to ethically nightmarish porn and never harboured a hateful thought or said or done something that berated, hurt, pressured or harmed a woman.  Some of them even want us to accept that we live in a patriarchy that infects all who emerge from it with misogynistic impulses, but that they, themselves, are strangely unaffected.Maybe I’m just jealous because I am so evidently flawed. But while I am sure the many women with whom the woke bros stand in solidarity are thrilled to see their allies batting for the right team, the woke bros are virtually useless when it comes to engaging sections of the male population who, like me, have not been so perfectly configured, men who perhaps sense that they must change but require guidance from other men on the path – as opposed to Twitter pointers from men who only speak publicly about other behaviour and not their own. Then we have Brian Beacom types. Men who’ll go to the grave believing the song and dance they made about gender equality was a valiant cry from the wilderness – and not the agonal gasp of a privileged but increasingly irrelevant perspective. Somewhere between the woke bros and the Beacoms, sit men like me, trying to carve out a new lane where a more honest and potentially vulnerable conversation about masculinity must take place. Which is what must happen  the struggle for gender equality is ever to arrive at its final destination.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804714.1537815363!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment labour party line offers little hope","story":"        The Labour Party conference will this afternoon vote on whether to \u0026#8220keep all options on the table\u0026#8221 when it comes to Brexit.                This aspiration, broad and vague as it is, may include the possibility of campaigning for a new referendum. But before any frustrated Remainers get too excited, it’s worth paying attention to the detail. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and is closest allies at the top of the party are no more enthusiastic about the possibility of a second referendum than they were yesterday.            Keeping all options on the table is language of the most non-committal nature. Anyone who would like to truly understand the Labour leadership’s position should pay attention to remarks made early yesterday by shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who said any so-called “People’s Vote” should be on the terms of the Brexit deal rather than on whether the UK should, in fact, remain part of the EU.            Labour Party members may yesterday have waved banners reading “Hate Brexit – Love Corbyn” but the very most it seems they can hope from the party leadership is support for a referendum which offers a choice between whatever deal Theresa May is able to salvage from the chaos - and a potentially-catastrophic no deal.Later yesterday, Mr McDonnell adopted the “all options on the table” party line but the truth was already out there.  When Mr Corbyn succeeded Ed Miliband as Labour leader in 2015, he promised a new kind of politics but it is becoming increasingly apparent that with increased trade union influence and the centralising of power to a small clique, the modern Labour party is the living breathing example of what we might consider the old politics. And the bad old politics, at that.Prime Minister Theresa May limps on, politically wounded by treacherous colleagues, humiliated by the EU, and struggling to find a vaguely plausible narrative on Brexit. Add to this unfortunate mix polling which shows growing support to reverse the decision take in 2016, and Labour is presented with the opportunity to seize the initiative, and perhaps even help the UK avert the worst impact of Brexit. Yet still he refuses to show leadership.Jeremy Corbyn may have convinced his supporters that they all have a voice in his party. Those who do not parrot the leadership line on Brexit should not, however, expect to be listened to.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nTuesday 25 Sep 2018 7:41 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbsp\n\nFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.\nIt is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.\nLaunched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.\nThe service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.\nFair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.\nThis means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.\nThe service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.\nDelivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.\nJamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\n\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\n\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"\nOne of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .\nHe has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.\nAlan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north.

partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards

the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a

have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished

We have an EU target to reach 60 per cent by 2030, and with your help, we aim to meet this and also exceed it.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“All councils in Northern Ireland are participating in Recycle Week 2018 and we urge you to check out top tips on council’s website and Facebook page over this week to help you recycle those sometimes missed items around your household.\n\nMid and East Antrim mayor Cllr, Lindsay Millar, said: “Household waste costs over £100 per tonne landfill tax. Recycling this waste saves over 50 per cent  on this cost. \n\n“Council can redirect this cost saving to finance local civic projects across the borough. \n\n“Recycling is good for the environment and will leave our countryside and green spaces in a beautul and undisturbed state for your children and grandkids as a result of less landfill sites across the country.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Why not also check out council’s Facebook page during Recycle Week where we’ll have a Q\u0026ampA session running all week.\n\n“You can ask questions about certain waste items you’re unsure about recycling, ask about which bin to use correctly, ask questions about your local Household Recycling Centre, and more! If you don’t have access to a computer, you can always contact our Waste Helpdesk on 0300 124 5000.”\n\nBelow we’ve included some short tips and advice on recycling more from around your home.\n\nReduce - Use a lunchbox instead of plastic wrap or tin foil. Carry a fork/spoon instead of using plastic cutlery. Buy fruit and veg loose, avoiding that plastic packaging. Buy boxes rather than bottles of detergents which can then be recycled.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nRe-use - Save take-away food containers for storage of nails/screws/buttons, etc. and make pots from empty plastic bottles. Have some items you could take to your local charity shop? Most accept clothing, shoes, jewellery, household items including glasses, plates, ornaments, etc.\n\nRecycle - Use your blue bin/kerbie box for recycling plastic bottles, ice cream/margarine tubs, yoghurt pots, biscuit trays and fruit punnets. Bring large plastic items such as garden furniture and toys to your local household recycling centre.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8642067.1537454750!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley by election recall process cost 188 000","story":"\nThe recall petition which failed to unseat Ian Paisley cost the public purse around \u0026#163188,000, it has emerged.\n\n                \nThe Electoral Office revealed the costings yesterday after the process – the first of its kind in the UK – came to an end after six weeks.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt is understood the bulk of the costs related to staffing the three centres where people could sign the petition in Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDUP MP Mr Paisley retained his seat after 7,099 people signed, 444 short of the required number.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland.

But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help? They are being left on the scrapheap and that’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nJackie is urging women who need help and advice about vaginal mesh implants to contact her via her Facebook page ‘TVT POP Mesh Problems N Ireland’ or by email: meshgirlni@icloud\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8639705.1537348575!/image/image.jpg","title":"storm ali latest motorists advised that m1 has reopened","story":"                \nEarlier the motorway was closed in both directions between Lisburn and Blacks Road due to a power line down across the road.\n\nwindow.twttr =  [0],    t = window.twttr ||      t  js = d.createElement  js.id = id  js.src = \"https:platform.twitter/widgets.js\"  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore   t._e = []  t.ready =        t\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n.tweety\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEarlier a post on PSNI Banbridge Facebook said: \"This will cause signicant disruption so please find an alternative route.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Please share.\"\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nA PSNI spokesman added: \"M1 Motorway is closed westbound from Black\u0027s Road Dunmurry and east bound from Saintfield Road due to fallen cables.\n\n\"Motorists should seek alternative routes. \n\n\"Saintfield Road is also closed at the junction of the old Ballynahinch Road due to a fallen tree. \n\n\"Motorists are advised to exercise extreme caution in adverse weather conditions.

He just went from a child to an adult.\n\n“As he grew up as an adult, he turned to a spiral of drink and drugs. He thought it was helping him but in reality it wasn’t. He didn’t know when to stop.\n\n“His doctor wrote him a letter, basically saying could he be housed in some sort of sheltered accommodation. It never happened.\n\n“As parents, we were desperate. He was either sitting in his room or out on the drink and drugs.\n\n“He couldn’t get out of the loop he was in. He needed serious help and he just was not getting it. It was a constant cycle that was going downwards. He needed professional help to deal with the grief he suffered.”\n\nIn April, Billy and Sharon were told by Social Services that it was not safe for Sebastian to live in the family home with his younger brother  and three sisters, ,  and .\n\n“As  putting him on to the street was the solution for a vulnerable adult who has addiction and mental health problems,” added Billy. “Social Services’ attitude was basically Sebastian is out of the house and the kids are safe. Now their big brother is dead. They are going to need counselling. It is just a vicious circle.\n\n“We are terried of a knock-on effect. What  someone else in our family decides to take their own le? We were given no help to find him somewhere. We had to find him some sort of sheltered dwelling to live in.”\n\nOn August 13, Sebastian’s West Belfast flat and the Haggan family home were raided by police who claimed they had a warrant to search for ammunition and weapons. The family have complained about the searches to the Police Ombudsman. Sebastian took his own le just five days later and Billy believes the raid set him over the edge. \n\n“Sebastian was out on the streets again after the raid when his landlord put him out. I got him sorted with a place in Ballymena. Five days after the raid, he killed himself. I think it was a trigger – he just could not cope with any more stress.\n\n“He was found with heroin paraphernalia lying around him. We are still waiting on official confirmation but it seems pretty likely he took a heroin overdose to end his own le. Earlier this year, he told his sister the best way to commit suicide was a heroin overdose. He was right.”\nBilly and Sharon have criticised the system which they say is failing people suffering from mental health issues.\n“Sebastian needed professional help but it just was not there. We begged for help from a psychiatrist and for him to be sectioned but nobody would do it.\n\n“We think he attempted suicide on three occasions before. After the second attempt when his sister rescued him from jumping off a bridge, the hospital said he was ‘stable’ and that he ‘wasn’t that bad’. \n\nSebastian himself was willing himself to get help. What more did he need to do? He’d just tried to take his own le. The authorities need to listen to families who are suffering. The system has crashed, it simply does not exist. Hospitals just cannot deal with the issue. \n\nPoliticians need to start doing something. There is a deluge of mental health patients at the moment and basically no help out there for them. Nobody seems to want to tackle the problem. More mental health staff and teams are needed.\n\n “We tried everything we could. At the end of the day, Sebastian was the one who injected himself and killed himself but it all goes back to mental health issues. \n\n“We won’t be the last family to suffer. I wouldn’t like to think what the total number of suicides will rise to.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But in a dire situation when there are few good options, desperate measures can sometimes be necessary. A referendum may be the least bad option now.\"\n\nMr O\u0027Brien suggested that the most likely outcome of the Brexit negotiations at present was the UK crashing out without a deal.\n\nHe suggested the blame for this almost entirely lied with the British side.\n\nHowever, he admitted: \"The decision by the Irish and EU side last November to demand of the British that they concede the principle that part of their sovereign territory - Northern Ireland - be removed from their customs territory was a major miscalculation. \n\n\"Perhaps it is because Europeans have shared the same customs territory for more than half a century that the signicance of the proposal was under-estimated. But under-estimated it was.\n\n\"Countries do not cede their customs territory to others on demand.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rhi inquiry dup special adviser regrets not declaring his fatherinlaw was recepient of scheme earlier","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Is that the case?”\n\nMr MacCarthy replied he did not know, but the law states it is a payment paid to each president and is not surrenderable at the end of the year.\n\n“It’s bizarre to me that public money is given out annually with no responsibility to anyone with no audit,” Mr MacSharry said.\n\n“It was remiss of previous PACs to not hold this meeting before, it’s timely and informative and I can think of 317,000 reasons why it was worthwhile.”\n\nThe allowance is paid on top of the 249,000 euro a year salary paid to the President.\n\nIreland’s highest ranking civil servant, Martin Fraser, whose responsibilities include being accounting officer for the President’s office, appeared before the Public Accounts Committee with Mr McCarthy to explain the processes and expenses of the Aras an Uachtarain.\n\nThe decision to examine presidential expenses was made after questions were raised over the summer over claims of extravagant spending by the office including expensive hotel suites on state visits.\n\nThe committee also heard that the personnel charged with auditing of the office did not meet for over three years.\n\nMr Fraser was accused of passing the buck and bad governance when he admitted the committee did not meet from 2014 to 2018, but claimed there were extenuating circumstances.\n\nThe internal audit committee was formed in 2014 when Mr Fraser appointed a chair and two other members to oversee the accounts.\n\nDue to a signicant personal issue, the chair had to be recused from his duties, no substitute chair was ever appointed and the committee did not meet again until February 2018.\n\nMembers from across the political spectrum were quick to criticise Mr Fraser’s decisions.\n\nWhen Mr MacSharry asked who does their job when they’re not available, neither of the men could offer an answer.\n\n“Is that proactive? If someone isn’t there the work stops – do you appreciate that’s a failing?  It’s poor practice of a way to run the country,” he said.\n\n“It’s a matter of public funds, I would hate to think that the work of the Oireachtas would stop because of the absence of one person.\n\n“The fact is when the chairman was missing, we didn’t do anything for nearly three years.”\n\nMr Fraser added that he took great assurance from Comptroller and Auditor General, who provided end of year audit reports in the absence of the committee.\n\nMr Fraser also received criticism for a letter he wrote to the committee stating that any investigation into the president’s expenses could be considered unconstitutional, which some members of the committee took offence at.\n\nMr Fraser questioned the political ramications of examining the president’s expenditure so close to the election on October 26.\n\nHe noted the constitution, which states the president is not answerable to either house of the Oireachtas or any court for the exercise of his office.\n\nIndependent TD Catherine Connolly said that the office of the president should be held to the same standard as other institutions and that Tuesday’s meeting exposed gaps in governance.\n\n“Every week we have this committee and put ious organisations like Gardai through this, it would be unfair not to put president’s office through it too,” she said.\n\n“We’ve looked at processes and you’ve admitted that some processes leave something to be desired.”\n\nMr Fraser said he was keen to stress he was not interfering, but that he was paying close attention to the constitution.\n\nHe said: “I wasn’t interfering with committee, I was making points it was my job to make.\n\n“The presidency is above politics, my job is dferent in the Aras than it would be in the Oireachtas.\n\n“The president himself is open to scrutiny and that will come out in election campaign.\n\n“I’m just very careful about the constitution.”\n\nThe committee also heard that although it is stated that the president’s office expenditure is 3.2 million euro a year, it is closer to 8.2 million euro when operational and other costs are considered.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar brexit deal can be done by november","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has said any move that would see Northern Ireland’s regulations dfer from the rest of the UK’s, likened to putting a border in the Irish Sea, would be a bad outcome.\n\nHer parliamentary allies, Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists, are strongly opposed to such a scenario.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s Chequers plan has been assailed by critics and Brexiteers have reiterated their support for finding a technological solution to the border.\n\nMr Varadkar said he had sought a lot of counsel in recent months from “wise old heads” who know Europe and know British politics and know Northern Ireland.\n\nHe added: “I came away from those meetings with the advice that it’s unchartered territory and unpredictable and do your best and I think that was probably the best advice I could have got.”\n\nMr Varadkar said Mrs May had reinstated her commitment to having a legally operative backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement while at an informal summit of European leaders in Salzburg recently.\n\nHe said: “And the EU 27 again in Salzburg gave their full solidarity behind Ireland and restated our position that there won’t be a withdrawal agreement at all, no transition period for the UK  there isn’t an Irish protocol, a legally operative backstop as part of that.”\n\nMeanwhile, during debate in the Irish Dail parliament, the Taoiseach touched on efforts to restore Northern Ireland’s stalled powersharing administration at Stormont.\n\nHe said: “I think clarity around Brexit could help.\n\n“Perhaps  by the October summit, or the November summit  there is one, we’re in a position to have a roadmap as to how Brexit going to work, what the new relationships are going to look like, we might be in a better position then to bring the parties together again.\n\n“Certainly the Government stands ready to do that.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36717510.ece/30238/AUTOCROP/w620h342/rabaneStpats20183.jpg","title":"irish to maintain uk rights after brexit but no preferential treatment for eu citizens","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

a position also supported by the Labour party. \n\nThe Cabinet meeting heard from the committee\u0027s head Prof Alan Manning. \n\n\nIts report\n states it is working off the assumption the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland will continue after Brexit, so \"any future restrictions on EEA migration will not apply to the Irish\". \n\n\"Sometimes we refer to the group of UK and Irish as simply the UK-born to make the report more readable,\" the reports states. \n\nMonday\u0027s Cabinet meeting was told that in the post-Brexit immigration system, EEA and non-EEA nationals \"should be part of one universal system\". \n\nIt is on the basis high-skilled migration is of more economic benefit to the United Kingdom than lower skilled migration. \n\nMinisters also agreed that once free movement is brought to an end, the new system tailored to suit the needs of the UK would boost productivity. \n\nDespite this belief, there are fears restricting the movement of lower-skilled labour could potentially damage the UK economy. \n\n\nThe BBC reports\n a Cabinet source as saying the agreement was not a firm decision, and there would be room for \"light touch migration\" for EU nationals as part of a trade deal with the EU. \n\nThe broadcaster\u0027s political editor Laura Kuenssberg notes that ending freedom of movement has become a \"rhetorical non-negotiable for Theresa May\". \n"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan steps out on first solo royal engagement","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It’s clearly linked with how active we are, the food we eat and the amount of sleep we get. Screen time can displace physical activity and is associated with a pattern of unhealthy snacking. It also increases our children’s exposure to the marketing of unhealthy foods. We need to get this balance right and parents can make a start by reducing their own screen time.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nFor children aged 2-5, the weekday average was approx. 1 hour 49 mins and 2 hours 13 mins at weekends.  For over 5s, the weekday average was almost two hours rising to more than 3 hours at the weekends.\n\nCaroline Bloomfield, Health and Social Wellbeing Improvement Senior Manager at the Public Health Agency said: “Ideally, under 2s should have no screen time while under 5s should have no more than an hour a day. For older children, it’s important to agree set limits that suit your family and to stick to them. Screen time is such a part now of daily le that trying to cut down on it might seem challenging. Children love to copy what others do so  they see Mum or Dad on the smartphone, chances are they’ll want to do the same. Having wind-down time with no screens before bedtime and enjoying more screen free meals together are two good places where parents can make a start.”\n\nThe START campaign aims to provide practical tools and advice for parents, to help them set limits on screen time and to encourage the whole family to become more active. It is encouraging families to make a ‘play pact’ by committing as a family to pause for play and spend less time on their screens. This doesn’t have to be organised physical activity or sport and all movement counts.\n\nFor more information visit:\n \n\nwww.makeastart.org\n It provides lots of simple ideas on getting active in and around the home and ways to make a positive, healthy start.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry sinn fein mla disappointed lack progress new investment bbc ensure equal access gaelic games northern viewers","story":"\nSinn Féin Foyle MLA Raymond McCartney has expressed disappointment at the lack of progress and new investment from the BBC to ensure equal access to gaelic games for northern viewers. \n\nHe was commenting after a Sinn Féin delegation held a meeting with the BBC in Belfast. \n\nRaymond McCartney said: “Sinn Féin met with the BBC on Monday to once again voice our concern at the lack of televised coverage of gaelic games for viewers in the north. \n\n“We are disappointed that BBC have made absolutely no progress or new investment to ensure the quarter of a million gaels in the north have equal access to gaelic games. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“While we welcome the live coverage of the 12 Irish League games, this cannot overshadow the need for more coverage of the GAA which is the largest spectator sport on the island of Ireland. \n\n“Since launching the Fair Play for Ulster Gaels campaign we have heard the frustration felt among GAA fans at what they feel is decades of neglect by BBC in terms of televising and mainstreaming gaelic games.\n\n“We believe that a collaborative approach from sporting organisations and broadcasters is required to end the inequalities surrounding televised coverage and parity of esteem for northern gaels.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"litter loathing puppet reminds people derry keep city tidy","story":"\nPhoto Caption:  Jodie McAneaney, Keep Northern Ireland Beautul’s Live Here Love Here Manager, is pictured with the star of a new anti-litter campaign – a litter loathing puppet who pulls no punches when it comes to offenders!\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor gives backing recycling week urges local householders reduce reuse recycle","story":"\nHouseholders across Derry were reminded this week of the need to ‘Reduce, reuse and recycle’ as Recycling Week got underway.\n\nThe Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, gave his backing to the campaign yesterday with the launch of a new furniture restoration course at Council’s New 2 You Re-use facility at Pennyburn Recycling Centre.\n\nLaunching the course, the Mayor said it would provide the opportunity for people to find out new ways of reusing old materials.\n\n“I am delighted to be here today to find out more about the services offered at the New 2 You centre,” he declared.\n\n“The skill and creativity of the staff in breathing new le into old and unwanted household items is extremely impressive and a great way of utilising old materials.

So it’s vital that there is a renewed focus on deterring illegal parking in the area as the new term begins.\n\nHe added: \"With this in mind I have asked the PSNI and traffic wardens to give a particular focus to the areas in question over the coming weeks to ensure there is minimum disruption for local residents.\"\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"festive fun in store at llanfyllin christmas market","story":"\nLlanfyllin Christmas Market is set to  in November\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8702039/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nFestive fun in store at Llanfyllin Christmas Market\n\nThere will be plenty of festive fun at Llanfyllin Christmas Market\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8702040/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                \n                            \n\n                            \nSkip to next image \u0026raquo\n                        \n                    \n"},{"url":null,"title":"llanfair caereinion teddy surprise for rail visitors","story":"\nTeddy meets Station Master, John Brinkley.\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8719001/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nTeddy surprise for rail visitors\n\nThe Vintage Weekend trains require extensive shunting activity at each terminus.\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gt \u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8718998/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nTeddy surprise for rail visitors\n\nTwo-year-old, Rowan Vivers meets Big Ted at Llanfair Train Station.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

attend his constituency dinner at a cost to ratepayers of \u0026#1631,500, it has emerged.\n\n                \nA special sitting of the Causeway Coast and Glens council was held in Coleraine earlier this week, where officers explained how £1,500 was paid to sponsor a table at the event hosted by Mr Paisley.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt is one of two councils to have sponsored a table at the dinner event it was revealed in May that Mid and East Antrim Council had done likewise at the same cost to ratepayers. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Electoral Commission has confirmed it is investigating and is treating that payment as “a donation” to Mr Paisley.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Northern Ireland Auditor’s office has also confirmed to the News Letter that it has looked into the payment as part of a wider audit of Causeway Coast and Glens Council.\n\nUlster Unionist councillor Richard Holmes told the News Letter: “The officers did present councillors with the correspondence surrounding the event. In essence, a phone call had been made by Ian Paisley Jr to the director of leisure and development Richard Baker, basically offering an invite to what he  communicated to be a business engagement dinner.\n\n“Council took him up on the offer and invited guests along from local business, the local community etc.\n\n“Council went along to the event, but they were not under the impression that it was a fundraiser. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The Northern Ireland Audit officers put a few shots across the boughs of the council, saying that you were being asked to co-ordinate with the DUP MP’s office. The audit office was basically saying there should have been a few alarm bells ringing.\n\n“The chief executive  did say he was embarrassed at the whole thing.”\n\nMr Holmes added: “I believe the council officers acted in good faith, but at this stage we do not know  council has inadvertently made a donation to a political party – but of course the Electoral Commission is investigating.”\n\nSinn Fein councillor Cara McShane, meanwhile, said: “Ratepayers have a right to be angry at this decision and Causeway Coast and Glens Council should immediately take steps to have the money reimbursed back into the public purse.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Paisley said in a statement: “I am content to await the outcome of the  Commission’s inquiry, commenced after political rivals made a complaint.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n

country singer \"Big Tom\" McBride has praised a new statue of him as a \"fitting tribute\".\n\n                \nIrish President Michael D Higgins unveiled the monument to Big Tom in Castleblayney on Sunday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe praised it as \"a wonderful testament to the popularity of Big Tom\".\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"That love for Big Tom, his music and the man he was is something that you know best but of course share, not only with people across our island of Ireland, not only in Irish communities across the world, but with many other peoples from dferent cultures,\" he said.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBig Tom, who was a huge star in the 60s and 70s, died in April aged 81, as the statue and festival in his honour were in the process of being planned.\n\nThe entertainer\u0027s son, Thomas, described the unveiling of the bronze statue of his father as a celebratory moment, tinged with sadness.\n\nThe Co Monaghan town centre was packed on Sunday with over a thousand fans travelling from across Ireland and further afield.\n\nThere were cheers as Mr Higgins unveiled the statue, before a rush of fans eager to see it up close and get their photo taken with it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThomas told those assembled that his family were devastated his mother Rose, who also died earlier this year, as well as his father were not there to see it.\n\n\"The main focus of my few words is to give thanks, and we have many people to thank for making this day possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This day is a very proud day for the McBride family, celebratory yet tinted with sadness, for they have departed, Mum and Dad.\n\n\"We are devastated that Mum and Dad aren\u0027t here today, I know they would have loved it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Thank you all.\"\n\nBig Tom and the Mainliners were formed in the 1960s and achieved widespread success.\n\nHenry McMahon, another member of the Mainliners, also described it as a day tinged with sadness.\n\n\"It\u0027s a wonderful day, tinged with sadness, but it\u0027s no less than Big Tom deserves, he was an icon, and still is an icon,\" he told the Press Association.\n\nUK-based sculptor Mark Richards said he had never seen a crowd like it, in the unveiling of all the pieces he has worked on.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained initially he had considered a sculpture of Big Tom on stage performing, but later decided on the sitting pose without the microphone in front of him, like a \"barrier\" between him and his fans.\n\nThat option was chosen by the family who felt it best reflected Tom\u0027s approachability and \"man of the people\" persona.\n\nAmong the fans in attendance were Richard and Marian Phillips from Co Kildare.\n\n\"I have been following Big Tom since 1971, he had a lovely manner, very natural, very down to earth, everyone was his friend,\" said Mr Phillips, who was wearing a Big Tom T-shirt.\n\nMyles Kavanagh had travelled from Kilkenny and dressed as Elvis for the occasion.\n\n\"It\u0027s magnicent, Big Tom would be proud of us all, Big Tom was the king of country, I may be the king of rock\u0027n\u0027roll but he was the king of country, we\u0027ll always have Big Tom in our memories,\" he said.\n\n\"He was so kind, he brought so much happiness to people with his music and he was a gentleman on and off the stage.\"\n\nThe unveiling came during the inaugural Castleblayney Celebrates Big Tom Festival, which opened on Culture Night and continued across the weekend.\n\nMcBride\u0027s career spanned more than five decades, culminating in his induction into the Irish Country Music Awards Hall of Fame in June 2016.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n
