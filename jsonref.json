It falls asleep inches from my head and wakes up beside me. I breathe its breath. I’ve always been reluctant to call my apartment “home” here in Catania. Over the past 10 years I’ve traversed the Middle East, photographing cities, their inhabitants and the conflicts that have ravaged that area of the world for decades. The streets of Baghdad, Mosul, Kabul, Amman, Khartoum and Tehran have been my home. I’d always considered those 50 sq metres in Catania as a pied-à-terre, a place to keep my clothes and my photo archive. I never could have imagined that after documenting the desperation of refugee camps in Iraq or mass graves in Sinjar, or aboard an ambulance collecting the dead among the Kurdish resistance in northern Syria, that I’d have to confront the world’s biggest story in my own small apartment.I’ve been living with Covid-19 since mid-March. My mother, my partner, the war reporter Marta Bellingreri, and other people close to me have been infected, but somehow I have been spared. I interpreted this peculiar twist as if Covid-19 had chosen me to photograph it from a different perspective. And I met the challenge, also because the reasons that brought the virus into my apartment are also extraordinarily tied to my career as a photographer.Last 25 February I hosted some friends and family members for a celebratory dinner. World Press Photo had just announced the 2020 winners, and, for the second time, I was selected, for my photograph of an Isis bride embracing her child in the prison camp of Al-Hol, north-east Syria. At the same time, cases of Covid-19 throughout Italy had risen from four to 322. No one could have imagined that Sicily’s patient zero was at that dinner table, a friend who had returned from Germany. He had no idea he was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. I left the day after for Khartoum with Marta to photograph a country in the throes of revolution for over a year.The call that changed that trip and the following weeks came six days later, in early March, as Italy and the world were changing for the worse. My friend who had been in Germany had tested positive for Covid-19. The alarm was sounded: phone calls to notify those who may have been infected and tests for the older adults who were at the dinner. Some of my family members tested positive, and my mother was taken immediately to an hospital. She’s 69 and has suffered from respiratory illness in the past. Her life was at risk and my world caved in.Turkey, where we had a connecting flight on the way to Sudan, had already cancelled all flights to Italy. Other countries had restricted entry for anyone who had been to Italy in the previous 14 days. Marta started manifesting symptoms: slight headache, a light fever. We started a self-imposed quarantine in Sudan. But we needed to go back. We returned to Italy with a connecting flight through Asia. Later the ministry of health in Sudan contacted us to track down the people we met: no one had symptoms, tests were negative and all were placed in preventive quarantine. Knowing that Sudan still has only six Covid-19 cases made us breathe a sigh of relief.Upon our arrival, everything seemed surreal. People wearing masks, deserted streets. As soon as possible, we had ourselves tested. Marta received a phone call from the doctor: “Good morning. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that you’ve tested positive. You mustn’t leave the house for any reason. If your fever exceeds 38°C or if you have difficulty breathing, call this number. Do you understand?”I tested negative and was incredulous. I’d been with Marta since that dinner on 25 February. And yet, the virus did not seem to be interested in me. The doctor believed that the test was a false negative, because I began developing symptoms. My temperature ranged between 37.3°C and 37.7°C for days. I decided to grab my camera and do something I had never done before: while I had always photographed others’ suffering, now I had to photograph Marta’s suffering and my own, just as Marta’s condition began to worsen. She had trouble breathing and chest pains, as if a stone were lodged in her ribcage. I put myself in self-isolation, spending the next 14 days with Marta, in my apartment, using protective gear.The doctor suggested that we order an oxygen saturation monitor from the local chemist. It became our best friend. “If the level is 95, everything is fine. If it drops to 92, you need to run to the hospital.” My level was 99 Marta’s 98. But she was not doing well: she told me that it was as if she were wearing a bodice with the laces pulled tight. Friends brought us our groceries, leaving them outside the door. We did our best to plan our days: take our temperature, drink our freshly squeezed orange juice, take our temperature again, call the doctor. We included the oxygen monitor in our daily regime and moved on. I saw my mother on Skype. She was now breathing more easily. We exchanged smiles, but I was out of sorts.The doctors asked me to take a second test, but again I tested negative. Perhaps I’m immune? The days dragged on in my apartment, in black and white, like my photos. Sometimes we tried to smile, imagining that I was asymptomatic, because I was the virus. Our smiles seemed to bring good news. My mother left hospital, but I won’t be able to see her for weeks. Marta started breathing well again, and so did I. I would have liked to photograph my country in the midst of this emergency, the battles that the doctors wage on the frontline, the hospitals pushed to their limits, Italy on its knees fighting an invisible enemy. That enemy, a day in March, knocked on my door instead.Alessio Mamo was talking to Lorenzo Tondo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24136b4a5b6517f706e88e645b8a947634d28e38/0_193_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c086568488e8bd5040ab2598bb45469","title":"europa28 review female writers on europes future","story":"Freedom is a recurring theme in an ambitious collection edited by Sophie Hughes and Sarah CleaveEuropa28 is an ambitious project organised by the Hay festival aiming to highlight the contribution of European women across literature, science and the arts.

In a standout piece, Irish actor Lisa Dwan brings the plays of Samuel Beckett to bear on dissolving the “confines of identity”. The German writer Yvonne Hofstetter makes a case for Europe to develop as a “major hegemonic power”, but much of the writing focuses on the need for us to forge relationships with other human beings, particularly refugees.The scale of vision is ambitious, looking far back in history and across vast territories.

I picked it not knowing anything about her – that fabulous title was enough – and I was swept away by the energy and immediacy of the stories. She has all the verve and daring of the best of Junot Díaz, with the insight of Edith Pearlman. I’m slowing down because I don’t want the book to end.The book that changed my lifeAngela Carter’s The Bloody Chamber. It was one of the first books I read after I finished my degree. Having spent three years immersed in classics, I was dumbfounded by Carter’s irreverence and inventiveness. It made me want to have a stab at prose up until that point I’d only written poetry. Quite bad poetry.The book I wish I’d writtenI’m not sure I wish I’d written it – because how on earth could I possibly have done so? – but I wholeheartedly admire and adore Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë. If I could only save one book from a supernatural conflagration of all books ever written, it would be this one.The book that influenced my writingThe economy and particularity of Albert Camus’s The Outsider set against the generous scope and unsettling omniscience of George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda.The book that is most underratedAmy Bloom is well known for her novels – and rightly so – but I have been in love with her short stories for years. The economy and pacing she employs while describing the entire life of a character fascinates me, as does her understanding of the tension between our interiors and exteriors. I am always urging people to read them.The book that changed my mindGermaine Greer’s Shakespeare’s Wife is a rigorously researched and deftly argued examination of the life of Anne Hathaway. It made me fully aware of the obloquy that has been inexplicably heaped upon her for centuries, by scholars and popular culture alike. I read it when I was beginning to write Hamnet and it made me want to give Anne Hathaway a voice and narrative of her own.The last book that made me cryI cannot get enough of Mary Oliver’s poems but they often make me a bit tearful so I try not to read them in public. My favourite is probably “Green, Green Is My Sister’s House” the line “It is impossible not  to remember wild and want it back” gets me every time.The last book that made me laughMy daughters and I have been reading Katherine Rundell’s Rooftoppers together, which is a firm favourite in our house. The relationship between Sophie and her ward, the absent-minded but affectionately liberal Charles, always makes us laugh. We particularly love it when he comes up against the dull and tedious child services woman, who believes that girls should wear dresses and always brush their hair. Hilarious notions.The book that I couldn’t finishI confess to making heavy weather of Henry James. I have, more times than I care to admit, made an optimistic start on The Bostonians before swerving away to read something else. Maybe this is the year I’ll make it to the end.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readThere should be no shame attached to reading, only pleasure. If you’re not enjoying a book, I tell my children, put it down and try a different one. Life is too short and libraries too large to waste time on books you don’t like.The book I give as a giftThe one I’ve probably wrapped up most often is Life After Birth by the brilliant Kate Figes. It’s a collection of essays about early motherhood, and I give it to friends who have just had a baby. It’s part insight, part research, part memoir: a mix that Figes pulled off like no other. I remember reading it during night feeds in the first few weeks of my son’s life and it instantly made me feel less alone. I am now deep into her book about the other end of parenting, The Terrible Teens, which is mystifyingly out of print. Someone, somewhere, please reissue it.The book I’d most like to be remembered forThe many books I’ve read to my children. There are books encountered at an early age that infiltrate your being, and they return to you throughout your life, along with the voices that read them to you. I suppose I’d like my offspring, in their distant adulthood, to occasionally recall that specific comfort and thrill of a good bedtime story.My earliest reading memoryI was listening to my parents’ copy of the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper with the sleeve lyrics open. The track “Fixing a Hole” began to play and I realised that I could see and comprehend the words in front of me because they matched what Paul McCartney was singing. It was an extraordinary, explosive epiphany for me. My comfort readMolly Keane’s Good Behaviour and Loving and Giving.

I cycled from Nunhead to her home in Blackheath. On the way I passed a tense crowd of people being forced to wait to get into the Iceland store in New Cross. I reached my friend’s block of flats, climbed the stairs to her front door and laid my satchel on the doormat. She opened the door, greeted me from a distance of a couple of yards, removed the groceries she’d asked me to bring, some salmon and a bottle of olive oil, and put them away. We chatted for about half an hour, me sitting on a step out in the hall, her standing in the doorway, neither of us getting closer than two yards. Her husband, whose mild cough a couple of days earlier had triggered her self-isolation, was a disembodied voice offstage. My friend and I always kiss hello and goodbye we’ve known each other for 10 years. Not this time. I went back to Nunhead, to queue for more food for my family – the butcher, the fishmonger and the greengrocer all had queues outside – then went home and washed my hands.It’s the small necessary tasks that get you through the abnormality: the assignments, the missions, the good deeds. They break down the fearfulness and strangeness of the greater emergency into smaller, more manageable chunks of personal time where we can see what we have to do and see, just as importantly, that we can actually do it. The more we have to confront the enormity of the changes around us, and our own inidual powerlessness to alter the tide of events, the more likely we are to break down or be paralysed. The merciful paradox of crises like these is to bring so many new chores and duties that the difficulties – sometimes the novelties – of solving each step helps occupy the part of our brain that yearns to know what’s going on and do something about it.Large, terrifying realities like the growing death toll from an incurable infectious disease, the collapse of the world economy, the sundering of all natural intimacy with wider family and friends – the fact nobody has any idea what happens next – take second place to immediate tasks. How can S and I entertain our four-year-old today? Do we have enough milk? How can my siblings and I help our parents in Scotland, who are in their 80s, if we can’t go to them? Am I two metres away from that guy? How much salmon is appropriate for a care package? Can I cycle up this steep hill to Blackheath, or should I get off and walk?In the past I saw the saving power of urgent personal tasks when I went to wars to write about them. It was quite frightening to head to a place where a war was: not knowing how you were going to be able to do your job in an unknown situation, the possibility of being detained and the (very remote) chance of being hurt. But I found that the closer I got to where war was, the less frightening it became. It broke down into a series of tiny surmountable personal tasks, surmountable, invariably, with the help of kind strangers as well as cash. Getting transport, the right ID, food, somewhere to sleep, finding people to interview, trying to talk your way past checkpoints, working out how, in a pre-mobile, pre-internet world, to communicate with home: seeing these problems and being obliged to overcome them created a set of stepping stones through chaos.It doesn’t always work out. If it’s impossible to win those small personal battles – because you’ve pulled a 14-hour hospital shift and there’s no food in the supermarket, or you haven’t got any money, or you’re a single mother with a young child and you’ve just fallen sick, or you missed the NHS-111 callback you waited all day for, or because the struggles you overcome are in your job and your job has disappeared – the anxiety about the bigger picture rushes back into the empty space left by a task undone.Or you may find yourself dragged by the need to feel a personal win to more extravagant projects. Early in the series of wars that wracked Chechnya as it tried to secede from Russia I came across an army of volunteers, drawn from the cohort of middle-aged, working class, ethnically Russian and Ukrainian women who did much of the municipal manual labour in late Soviet times. They were attempting to rebuild, pretty much by hand, the railway station in the centre of the Chechen capital Grozny, using the bricks from the shell-demolished rubble of the old one. I suspect they probably knew in their hearts that their work wouldn’t stand – as it turned out, the worst of the shelling of their city still lay in the future – but that was why the sight of their self-consciously cheerful labour was so moving: they toiled feverishly in the moment to smother their misgivings about the future.I don’t mean to sound confident in my knowledge of how to get through this. The day of my salmon run to Blackheath was also the day I realised my experience wasn’t worth so much. I lived in Soviet Kiev when the USSR fell apart. I know first-hand about shortages and hoarding, hyperinflation and the black market. I spent a couple of years in a world where the only way you could get petrol was by buying it illegally from a taxi driver’s official ration. I was once given a brick-sized bundle of banknotes tied up with string as small change for a bottle of wine. I queued for bread. I queued for half an hour for what certainly seemed like the only hard cheese left in the city, then saw the last kilogram bought by the woman in front of me. I’ve also spent much of the past six years writing a novel set in England during the first onset of the plague in 1348.And yet there I was, in Britain in 2020, realising that my fellow citizens, many of whom have never been to a country in breakdown or been interested in the Black Death, absolutely had the jump on me in terms of hoarding – in the sense that every online outlet in the country had long since sold out of paracetemol, small freezers and cheap webcams. Experience and common sense tell me that panic-buying is a mistake. But if my experience had been that of a participant in a crisis, rather than a witness who always had the option of going back to a safe and normal country, it might have offered an alternative piece of wisdom: don’t be the last one to panic.If you’d asked me a few months ago, I would have speculated that the people of Britain weren’t ready for a global health emergency. The evidence now is of a more nuanced truth: that a significant number of people aren’t surprised when everything falls apart. Even if they’ve never known quite how it would go down, they’ve been expecting it, and the reaction is not to take comfort in the achievement of small, practical, immediate steps for daily life but to act as if the only two possible states for society to exist in are normality, and the apocalypse. I feel sure now that a hefty minority of my fellow citizens harbour the innate ability to switch from Gardeners’ Question Time persona to protagonist of The Road in the blink of an eye – and, what is more disturbing, back again.The boundary between the normal and the abnormal, between the states of social security and social breakdown, is elusive. Usually to arrive in the middle of somebody else’s war or disaster as a foreigner is to be dropped into a kind of mirror image of a “normal” country, where a massacre or the violent destruction of a building is a shocking event. In a country at war, or facing utter economic ruin, the sight of smartly dressed young people going off to work in an office, or a new building being built, is as shocking as an explosion. What you tend to miss, as an outsider, is the moment of transition from one state to another – when a normal country with occasional outbreaks of emergency shifts to being a crisis country with occasional outbreaks of peace and pleasantness.Once in Grozny at the end of 1994 I experienced this transition as a visitor. On the first day, the separatist-held city, surrounded as it was by Russian troops, still turned its face to the world of civilisation, in the sense that when the Russians bombarded an oil installation, the city authorities sent a fire engine, pointlessly, to tackle the flames, as if earnest civilian effort could enclose chaos and make it disappear. The next day, the Russians attacked, and regardless of the detail of what happened afterwards, the mood of the city changed. Its civilian character shrivelled. It seemed to me that when I walked across the main square in the morning there were still a few civilians trying to go about their business but that when I walked back a few hours later the passersby were all soldiers. The peace of the city, its civic spirit, had drowned. The only sound between the gunfire was the crackle of burning roof timbers and broken glass underfoot.I feel in the last couple of weeks I’ve lived through a similar transition as a native, but without the obvious physical destruction – a different kind of abnormality. I’ve never been in an epidemic before and yet I find myself dogged by a kind of false memory of one. When I set out to write a novel set in a time of plague, unable, as I thought, to visit an infected England, I thought I would at least make, on foot, the journey my characters made, from the Cotswolds to Weymouth, where the Black Death first made landfall. I walked the route at the time of year the plague arrived, in July, and the summer of 2013 was hot and sunny. I imagined my characters disbelieving that the pestilence could be rife in such a fair green land of larksong, downs and flowers. For all the memories of wars this is the memory, the memory of an imagined thought from an epidemic six centuries ago, that comes to my mind on these days of brilliant blue plane-free skies, when the apple, cherry and magnolia blossom is so lush on the trees of London and the gutters are filled with pink petals: how can so many people be suffering when the world looks so fine and peaceful? But in the present I can’t keep my thumb off the phone for long. And I don’t know whether there are more ambulances or I simply notice them more: I hear sirens. I remember that people are suffering, and normal has gone away.• To Calais, in Ordinary Time by James Meek is published by Canongate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88622903e3c40d16117d6108750a0216c790d84/0_40_4017_2410/master/4017..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be04563d1b49ea0f5b47d0597f9fb224","title":"coronavirus sainsburys to ease shopping limits but allow only one adult per household","story":"New rules begin on Sunday and supermarket says stock is closer to normal levelsSainsbury’s is to loosen purchasing restrictions on most items from Sunday – excluding some high-demand essentials – but is introducing a policy of limiting one adult per household entering its stores.In a letter to its customers, the Sainsbury’s chief executive, Mike Coupe, said that as panic-buying had largely subsidised supermarket shelves were now full throughout the day.“People have been queuing to get into our stores when they open in the mornings, but customers are now finding they can shop at any time of the day and feel confident in finding most of what they need,” he said.“Most people are now just buying what they need for themselves and their families. This means we now often have stock on the shelves all day and at the end of the day.”Coupe said limits on the number of items customers could buy would start to be removed, although the three Easter egg limit had been scrapped immediately. Restrictions would remain on “the most popular items”.“I am pleased to tell you that we will start to remove limits from Sunday,” he said. “Limits will remain in place on the most popular items which include UHT milk, pasta and tinned tomatoes.”Earlier this week, supermarkets including Aldi, Lidl, Morrisons and Waitrose announced the relaxation of quantity curbs after a decline in the number of shopping trips as a result of the lockdown.Coupe also said Sainsbury’s was to start to enforce a one adult per household rule to keep customers and store workers better protected from the virus.“From today, we are asking everyone to please only send one adult per household to our shops,” he said. “This helps us keep people a safe distance apart and also helps reduce queues to get into stores. Our store teams will be asking groups with more than one adult to choose one adult to shop and will ask other adults to wait. Children of course are welcome if they are not able to stay at home.”Coupe also said Sainsbury’s online grocery service had undergone a huge expansion from offering 370,000 home delivery and click-and-collect slots two weeks ago to 600,000 by the end of next week, with capacity set to grow further.He said the grocer had offered priority online delivery to more than 450,000 elderly or vulnerable customers. “I apologise to customers who have been unable to get through to our online team,” he said. “The team is working at full capacity and we are doing our very best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68a45b4dcd66a087357013ca50029424e5f57f7/0_183_5496_3298/master/5496..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb0922906a952aff858422be942e6622","title":"stocks markets data china economy covid19 coronavirus non farm payrolls jobless us pmi business live","story":"Composite PMI data shows UK business activity sunk to a record low in March following the Covid-19 lockdownIn our full write up of UK and eurozone PMI’s, Claus Vistesen captures most people’s reaction to the bloc’s business activity figures: In one line: horrid, hideous, harrowing … you get the picture.We are struggling to come up with words to describe these numbers, which are now so far out of any reasonable range that they are difficult to interpret.You can find the full story here:“The likelihood of a global recession is now a given.” That’s according to Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply which publishes the PMI market data. Commenting on the latest UK services figures, Brock said:The services sector was sucked into a black hole and flung into the unknown by the forceful impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus, affecting every area of supply chains from transport to purchasing levels and job creation. The abrupt drop in new orders was the sharpest since the survey began in 1996 according to the PMI data. Export orders were hit particularly hard and, in some cases, dissolved into nothing as border closures and travel restrictions resulted in the immediate cessation of normal business activities.He adds that this had a severe knock-on effect on employment, with job losses jumping to levels last seen in June 2009. It’s increasingly difficult to find the words to describe the devastation as every region in the world fights to save human life as the first priority. The likelihood of a global recession is now a given, though its duration and severity has yet to reveal itself. One thing is for certain, with the lowest business optimism for over 20 years, the immediate outlook for the services sector is beyond grim.And in case you’d like a visual representation of what’s been going on between Moscow and Riyadh:More on the oil price moves amid reports that Opec+ (the cartel led by Saudi Arabia and Russia) is set to hold a virtual meeting on Monday.Here is the latest from our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose: Global oil markets appear torn between hope and despair after US President Donald Trump triggered the fastest oil price surge in history by claiming to have brokered a ceasefire in Russia and Saudi Arabia’s oil price war.The oil price retreated from its biggest ever one day gain on Thursday by tumbling from brief highs of $33 a barrel to below $29 in early trade as growing scepticism of the President’s claim set in. Since then, the price of Brent crude has climbed back above the $30 a barrel mark, nearly 20 per cent higher than its levels 24 hours earlier, after Opec sources reportedly confirmed that the cartel is debating whether they can make the cuts.Trump’s tweet claiming that Riyadh and Moscow plan to put aside their rivalry to strike a deal which would cut at least 10 million barrels a day from global production may have been premature - but, for now, the market is pricing in the chance it just might happen.Unsurprisingly, European stocks have fallen even further since the disappointing PMI data this morning. Newsflash: China is slashing the amount of cash that small and medium sized banks have to hold as reserves, to help pump more liquidity into the economy. The People’s Bank of China is expected to cut the reserve requirement ratio by a total of 100 basis points, split between April and May. It is expected to release around 400 billion yuan (£46bn) into the Chinese market, according to reports. The move is part of attempts to support China’s economy, as it starts to emerge from the coronavirus crisis. Senior management at Primark’s parent group Associated British Food have agreed to cut their pay in half during the coronavirus crisis, our colleague and retail Sarah Butler explains. While all of the decline in business activity across the UK and eurozone aren’t necessarily be surprising given the coronavirus lockdown, the falls are proving even worse than initial estimates and are causing a re-think about how severe the contraction will actually be. The beleaguered airline industry may have at least one rescue package on the horizon. Air France-KLM is said to be in talks with banks about securing a multibillion euro loan package backed by both the French and Dutch governments.Air France may get as much as €4bn euros in French-guaranteed loans while KLM could get close to €2bn backed by The Hague, Reuters reported, citing sources. Taken alone, the UK services sector suffered its steepest decline for more than two decades. The reading came in at 34.5 for March, below flash readings of 35.7 and down from 53.2 in February.The report from IHS MarkitCIPs explains: The slump in activity was almost exclusively linked by survey respondents to business shutdowns and cancelled orders in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. That exceeded the previous record low logged during the height of the global financial crisis. It was also the fastest downturn for the services sector since the survey started in July 1996. That is despite an uptick in technology services, where there were pockets of expansion (which is pretty much to be expected following the surge in remote home working). You can read the full survey here.There’s been no relief for the UK either.UK composite PMI came in at 36.0 in March, which is even lower than flash estimates of 37.1. That is a sharp fall from 53.0 in February and marks the lowest level since the survey began in January 1998. The IHS MarkitCIPS survey notes that there has been a slightly faster reduction in private sector output than seen at the at the height of the financial crisis, when the index fell to 38.1 in November 2008.

This time they will be held accountable for how prepared Britain wasThroughout history, pandemics have often had profound economic effects. The most famous of all, the Black Death of the mid-14th century, wiped out between a third and two-fifths of the population of western Europe. The labour shortages that followed are credited with hastening the end of the feudal system.Covid-19 is nowhere near as deadly as the Black Death, but the shock it has dealt to an already vulnerable global economy has been immense. Perhaps inevitably, there is talk of life never being the same again.But this is what was said last time. Many on the left thought that when the banks nearly went bust in 2008, the dominant free-market model would be replaced by a more progressive alternative.It didn’t happen. The scale of the crisis wasn’t enough to bring about fundamental change those who were the largest beneficiaries of free movement of capital were rich, powerful and well dug in and the narrative that emerged about the 2008 crash was at odds with what really happened.Narratives matter a lot. Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s message to the American people in the 1930s was that their lives had been wrecked by Wall Street’s greed. FDR positioned his government as the friend of the unemployed and the enemy of reckless speculation. The story told by the Thatcherites and the Reaganites in the late 1970s was that organised labour had become too powerful, and the big states that emerged from the New Deal era were strangling enterprise.The best example of how narratives shape political outcomes happened in Britain after the last crisis. The truth about the 2008-09 recession was that it was a global phenomenon facilitated by the deregulation of finance and inadequate supervision of banks. This allowed a debt bubble to inflate over many years. When it popped, the banks found themselves unable to meet the losses on their wild speculation. London’s role as a global financial centre meant Britain suffered more than most.But the narrative that emerged was different. The story told by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government of 2010 was that Britain’s problems were the result of the previous Labour government’s profligacy. Budget deficits had been run in good times and had exploded when the economy started to contract. The Conservatives offered any number of soundbites: Labour had crashed the car, it had maxed out the nation’s credit card, it had failed to mend the roof while the sun was shining. Britain would have to endure a painful period of austerity to mend the hole in the public finances, but Gordon Brown was to blame.It all looks a bit different this time. Although his approval ratings have picked up, Boris Johnson’s task of weaving a compelling narrative out of twin economic and public health crises is much more difficult than the challenge that faced David Cameron in 2010.Johnson has been forced to go further and faster in his response to Covid-19 than Brown did back in 2008. The cost of lost output is unknowable because it is unclear how long the economy will be locked down, but it will be enormous – and inevitable. The government has decided to keep all but essential workers at home. It therefore has no choice but to protect jobs and incomes, whatever it takes. The budget deficit is going to balloon, just as it did at the end of the noughties, and for the same reason: recession means the government spends more and takes in less in tax.Nor will it be realistic for Johnson to say that he has no alternative but to impose another period of belt-tightening when the economy eventually comes out of hibernation. Austerity was an economic failure, resulting in a lost decade for wages, sluggish growth and public finances in a worse state than they were before the last crisis.But austerity has also proved a political liability for the Conservatives. The public is in no mood to stomach NHS cuts. Nurses and care workers are a lot more popular than bond dealers and bankers. To scrap infrastructure projects – the customary, if short-sighted, response of hard-up governments down the ages – would be a repudiation of the manifesto that won the prime minister his election victory less than four months ago.One of the problems a party faces when it is in power for a long time is that blaming the opposition for the mess it allegedly left behind no longer cuts it. The Conservatives have been in power for a decade. They will eventually be held to account over how prepared the UK was for this crisis.Questions will arise: was the NHS equipped to cope with a pandemic? The years ahead of the financial crisis saw the biggest sustained increase in health spending since the creation of the NHS in 1948 the years since 2010 have seen the smallest increases. Was the welfare system in a better shape to cope with the sharp contraction of the economy in 2008, or in 2020? Benefits were far more generous a decade ago than is the case today. Labour actually made a much better job of mending the roof.For the right, this is the second major economic crisis in little more than a decade. It’s the second time the state has needed to come to the rescue of an economic system where the gap between rich and poor has widened, corporations pay as little tax as they can get way with, too little attention is paid to the climate emergency, and a large proportion of the workforce is one paycheck from penury. For the left, it should be an open goal.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e473fa3a1921ec0a7dbbdb3ca0b0c6657e7d78b/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d31c27cce7a5568d7b51aa75b1f4d97","title":"jared kushner coronavirus pandemic","story":"Trump’s adviser bragged of his own wisdom and reportedly told the president that Cuomo was being ‘alarmist’ Jared Kushner is not a guy to turn to for sound political advice. Most recently, he reportedly told the president that Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor, was being “alarmist” after he announced that his state required 30,000 ventilators to help get through the pandemic.To add insult to injury, Kushner also bragged of his own wisdom and told those assembled that Cuomo was wrong. According to Vanity Fair, Kushner declared: “I have all this data about ICU capacity. I’m doing my own projections, and I’ve gotten a lot smarter about this. New York doesn’t need all the ventilators.”The princeling has helped place American lives and bodies on the line. New York’s hospitals have become combat zones, its morgues and funeral homes look like abattoirs. Meanwhile, the US is locked down and the administration is projecting up to a quarter-million dead even if everything goes right.American carnage is now. We may witness more deaths in months than its troops suffered in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam after years of fighting.When Mike Pence compares the US to Italy, we have a problem whose glaring scars will be felt long after Donald Trump leaves office. Coronavirus won’t be disappearing in a matter of days despite the president’s earlier assurances. Trump ignored the intelligence community and his national security staff, and now we must pay a collective price.Unfortunately, Kushner doesn’t only suffer from intellectual overreach. Self-dealing may have made a cameo too in the middle of crisis, and we have seen this movie before. Earlier, the Kushners had attempted to attract capital from China, by touting EB-5 visas in exchange for investments and looked to Anbang, a Chinese conglomerate, to bail them out of their real estate positions.When Kushner was boasting about data and Trump was going on about testing websites, they were probably referring to Oscar Health, an insurance company tied to the Kushner family. In turn, Oscar appears to have been involved in the government’s efforts to map the spread of the disease.According to reports and filings, Josh Kushner, Jared’s brother, still owns a piece of Oscar, and Jared belatedly ested his interest after entering government. If the Trump Organization can bill the Secret Service when they guard the president at his personal properties, why can’t the Kushner kids make a few dimes off the taxpayer?Sadly, none of this should come as a surprise. Kushner never deigned to come clean on his SF-86, his federal disclosure form, a prerequisite for obtaining a security clearance, until he was squeezed by external events, the drip of incessant leaks, headlines and hearings.Reportedly, the delays surrounding Kushner obtaining a security clearance stemmed from more than his inability to properly complete the pertinent paperwork. Questions swirled about ties to overseas investors, foreign governments and contacts. Ultimately, Kushner received his White House security clearance the same way he got into Harvard – “Daddy” pulled some very expensive strings.To be sure, this is not the first time Kushner put his father-in-law’s political career at risk. In 2017, Ivanka’s husband urged Trump to fire James Comey, the FBI director. As he saw it, career FBI agents, Democrats and Trump’s base would applaud the dismissal.Wrong. The “rid me of this meddlesome priest” thing didn’t work so well the first time. Ask Henry II. In death, Thomas Becket was venerated.The president acceded to Kushner and political wreckage ensued. Against this backdrop, Steve Bannon, the brains behind Trump’s 2016 campaign, compared Kushner to “air” and derided him as a “dope”.In case anyone forgot, Bob Mueller dogged Trump and his campaign staff for two years. Paul Manafort sits in prison while Mike Flynn and Roger Stone await sentencing.To further complicate things, Trump can no longer deliver a speech to Congress without Nancy Pelosi smirking over his shoulder or ripping up his texts. Viewed in this light, Jared helped cost the GOP its control of the House of Representatives.If Kushner weren’t married to the boss’s daughter he would not be anywhere near the Oval Office. But Trump treats the presidency like a family business, and we know how that has ended before: a passel of bankruptcies and a pile of debt.These days, the sun is setting later but darkness will be casting its broad shadow earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c32a9764ff60701be8e59b5bccb8b191c57aa1/0_184_5530_3318/master/5530..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b98b37e39c6391e921ed286c0dc3cdce","title":"week three isolation kids","story":"Hostility increasingly lurks in public spaces, but every night the clapping for the hospital workers gets louder We are in the third week of school closures and general lockdown in New York and I keep thinking of the movie Home Alone. Famously in that film, Kevin went wild for his first few days off the grid, eating ice-cream for dinner and jumping on the furniture. After that, he tidied up and discovered that order and structure are the only way to live. When his mum came home at the end of the movie, he had reached a state of wisdom.The trajectory from school’s out abandonment to set routine held true for the first two weeks at home. Now we’re in a new phase – one not covered by the three-act structure. If this pandemic has exposed anything, it’s how arbitrary many of the things we take for granted really are, including the way we organise our time. We dossed about, we knuckled down, and then this week we hit a wall. “I don’t want to,” said my kids when I set up the equipment for home-school lessons. I had no real desire to make them. We are unravelling and resetting, again.It’s not just school. For those lucky enough to be healthy and have jobs, the mood veers wildly between anxiety and optimism. Several female friends report unwanted erotic dreams about Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York and very much man of the hour. (It begs an unthinkable analogy with Rudi Giuliani after 911.) We are all working on our time management skills, while realising that the only really valuable time management tool is a wife to watch the kids.Outside the house, meanwhile, things get stranger. So far, neighbourliness still reigns within our own networks, there’s a sense of solidarity. But there is an increasingly odd dynamic in public. In the supermarket, we glare at each other for passing too close. Hostility lurks near the surface. In the laundry room, someone stands three inches from me while loading the drier above mine. “Hey,” I snap. “Sorry,” he says. It’s all very awkward.During the middle of the week, news reports say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is about to recommend everyone wear a mask outside the house. It’s impossible to get one on Amazon and so we walk to a weird toy store in my neighbourhood, still open via a loophole that classifies sellers of “office supplies” as essential businesses, that is rumoured to have masks. The entrance is shuttered, but like something from a bad dystopian movie, after we’ve milled about on the sidewalk for a minute, someone sees us and opens the grille half way. We duck in. It’s a maximum of six masks per person, for $60 – 10 times what it should cost – and I’m only too happy to pay.At 7pm that night, we go out on our terrace and clap for the hospital workers. People bang pots and pans. There is universal cheering. I had wondered if the novelty of this would wear off, too, diminishing through gratitude fatigue. But it hasn’t. The cheering, perhaps the real barometer of the city’s mood, is different from one day to the next. It keeps getting louder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd37af4db15d05cebb12d7b8bd71db12270c90e/63_266_3212_1928/master/3212..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e273c2878e5dca9339b7c7bbdb84dc7","title":"how have you been affected by the coronavirus cancellation of the edinburgh festivals","story":"If you were planning on performing or attending the festivals, we’d like to hear from youThe cancellation of this year’s Edinburgh festivals, including the world-famous fringe, will be felt far and wide.

Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs.\u0026nbspAs this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.If you want to help,\u0026nbspfind your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund.Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use\u0026nbspFeeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice.Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.About one in three people seeking groceries at not-for-profit pantries last month have never previously needed emergency food aid, according to interviews with a dozen providers across the country.The national guard has been deployed to help food banks cope with rising demand in cities including Cleveland, Phoenix and St Louis amid growing concerns that supplies may run low as the crisis evolves. Overstretched food pantries are switching to drive-thrus and home deliveries to minimize the spread of Covid-19 as almost 300 million Americans are urged to stay at home.“I’ve been in this business over 30 years, and nothing compares to what we’re seeing now. Not even when the steel mills closed down did we see increased demand like this,” said Sheila Christopher, director of Hunger-Free Pennsylvania, which represents 18 food banks across 67 counties.Last year, 4.3bn meals were distributed to more than 40 million Americans through a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries, schools, soup kitchens and shelters, according to Feeding America, the national food bank network. The working poor, elderly and disabled and infirm accounted for the vast majority of food bank users.This week, the  contacted food banks and pantries in nine states, which all reported unprecedented demand, plummeting donations from retailers, and a fall in personnel due to the coronavirus crisis.This snapshot is representative of the national picture, according to Feeding America. “This is a perfect storm impacting food banking as we know it,” said a spokeswoman, Zuani Villarreal.On Tuesday, Cleveland police and the Ohio national guard helped load boxes of groceries into cars at a new drive-thru pick-up service located in the huge downtown municipal car park.The rust belt states are among the hardest hit by the coronavirus economic crisis. More than 187,000 Ohioans filed for unemployment benefits during the third week of March when businesses were closed by the governor – an extraordinary increase on the 7,046 claims filed the previous week, according to the Department of Labor.The Greater Cleveland food bank received 800 calls to its helpline during one day last week – eight times the usual number. “I’ve never seen anything like it in over 20 years of service. We’re seeing people from every socio-economic level because the majority of Americans live paycheck to paycheck,” said the food bank’s CEO, Kristin Warzocha.Half of American adults have either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate’s 2019 Financial Security Index.There was a similar dramatic scene in Phoenix, Arizona, where 1,500 people queued up for food boxes at the St Mary’s main office – compared with 450 just two weeks ago. Here, the national guard is also pitching in at the makeshift drive-thru centre as volunteer numbers have plummeted from 250 a day to less than 50, as the vast majority are senior citizens advised to stay home to minimize the risk of Covid-19.In total, St Mary’s – the oldest known food bank in the world – supplies 700 pantries, shelters, churches and social service centres in seven counties where one in five children struggle with hunger.“First we saw people who lived paycheck to paycheck, got laid off and didn’t know where the next meal was coming from, followed by those who had a couple of weeks of savings. Now, people who knew about us because they donated or volunteered are coming in for food,” said Jerry Brown, media spokesman for St Mary’s. “The 2008 recession doesn’t touch this. It’s a different ballgame.”Before the coronavirus pandemic, about 37 million, or one in eight, Americans could not always access enough nutritional food to lead healthy, active lives. Food insecurity forces families to make tradeoffs between basic needs such as housing, medical bills and food, and many do not qualify for federal nutrition programs.The government rescue packages include some measures to help alleviate food insecurity such as expanding eligibility for food stamps, increasing commodities donations from the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and providing $1,200 to every American earning under $99,000.But experts warn that help has been slow, patchy and inadequate so far.“Philanthropy and not-for-profits are not going to be able to meet food demands. The government needs to step in,” said Kellie O’Connell, chief executive of the Lakeview pantry in Chicago.Caitlin Welsh, director of global food security at the Washington based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: “The supply chain is strong but as the number of food insecure people increases continuously, we’ll perhaps need a new wave of federal legislation directed specifically at household food security.“These numbers show that the pandemic is causing economic shocks never experienced in our lifetime.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/412cbeed8f44a9940234b1c066598df3fb29e1b1/0_109_3500_2100/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d759ca1ed4e8e95963fb40f0c1aaf2d4","title":"insects likely approved human consumption by eu","story":"Food safety agency’s decision could put mealworms, locusts and baby crickets on menus It is being billed as the long-awaited breakthrough moment in European gastronomy for mealworm burgers, locust aperitifs and cricket granola.In the next few weeks the EU’s European Food Safety Authority is expected by the insect industry to endorse mealworms, lesser mealworms, locusts, baby crickets and adult crickets as being safe for human consumption.The ruling is likely to lead to the final authorisation of their sale across the EU as a “novel food” by as soon as the autumn, opening up opportunities for mass production of a range of insect dishes to be sold across Europe for the first time.“These have a good chance of being given the green light in the coming few weeks,” said Christophe Derrien, the secretary general of the industry organisation International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed. “We reckon these authorisations will be a breakthrough for the sector so we are looking for those authorisations quite impatiently. They are taking the necessary time, they are very demanding on information, which is not bad. But we believe that once we have the first novel food given a green light from EFSA that will have a snowball effect.”In the eyes of leading players in the insects-as-food industry, the potential for their high-protein delicacies has been held back by a lack of EU-wide approval.The UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Finland have taken a permissive approach to a 1997 EU law that requires foods not eaten before that year to get novel food authorisation.Those national regulators decided the EU law did not pertain to animals used for food. As a result, a host of insect-based products can be found in British, Dutch, Belgian and Finnish supermarkets. About 500 tonnes of insect-based food for human consumption is produced every year.But such products are banned in France, Italy and Spain, among other countries. In 2018, a new EU law sought to bring some clarity. It stipulated that insect-based dishes would also require novel food authorisation.A transition period was established to allow companies already producing food from insects to operate until they received a judgment on the safety of the species they work with and final approval by the EU’s institutions.Indeed, companies such such as Protifarm in the Netherlands, Micronutris in France, Essento in Switzerland and Entogourmet in Spain are said to be preparing to ramp up their operations.“We have many of our members building bigger factories because the key to success is to upscale your companies and produce on a mass scale. And this is already happening,” Derrien said. “We are expecting the next few years will be very interesting ones and obviously the novel food authorisations will definitely help.”He added: “The sort of foods ranges from whole insects as an aperitif or as snacks to processed insects in bars or pasta or burgers made out of insects. We believe that insects for food is one solution for some of the biggest challenges we are facing on the planet. In the context of scarce resources, and insect production is not too demanding, you have the capacity to produce high-quality protein. That is a very promising solution.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eebb1108ceebfe6efc13f4fa1bc04cd314a384a7/0_143_3539_2123/master/3539.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a1e727ccbffe4af95afd40e51231621","title":"anna jones simple staple recipes for lockdown","story":"As we face a long haul in isolation, the need for easy and resourceful recipes is greater than ever.

Stay home and cook.A tin of beans has got me out of trouble many times when the fridge is bare. Pinto, black-eyed or black beans would all work here, as would any tortillas or wraps. The flavours will, I hope, bring a bit of sunshine in.A version of a family favourite, made mostly from tins. It uses some basic (and swappable) veg – the rest comes from your store cupboard.A great way of using up odds and ends of root veg, greens and hunks of bread. Bread, alongside olive oil, is used to top the soup, softening and thickening it, for a texture in which I find great comfort.This traybake revolves around three staples: a (small) sack of potatoes, a bag of frozen peas and a block of feta. If you have these three, you can then switch up the seasonings and herbs according to what else you have at home.This is what I make when anyone in the house gets the first sign of a cold. A simple broth with slurpable noodles.A great starter bread to bake if you are new to bread-making or can’t get your hands on yeast. The beetroot can be swapped for any root vegetable you have around.A bowl of dal soothes like nothing else with its smooth consistency and riotous pops of flavour. This is a forgiving recipe, so leave out some of the spices or the curry leaves if you don’t have them.A bag of frozen fruit, a pot of creme fraiche or yoghurt and a blender magically make this ice-cream. Cheering for young and old.Cake has been a constant during these weeks at home, an afternoon ritual. This one might just be my all-time favourite.The rate of snacking has hit an all-time high in our house and these have come in useful.

It’s a line I’ve loved nearly all my life, not least because it reminds me of big ladies in smock dresses at Dent family funerals in the 1980s. Up at dawn to make a tipsy cake, then turn two pounds of chicken breast “coronation” via the application of curry powder and jam, and wave off the corpse.I’d like to say that “Connie slicing baps” has been my personality throughout lockdown thus far, but that’s not the full story. Perhaps, like me, your Covid-19 crisis persona shifts through several gears each and every hour, from calm to terrified to brave to depressed to jolly, via gallows humour and so on. The only constant has been working out what to eat at a time when many ingredients we once took for granted are scarce.In my most Connie moments, I’m frankly far too busy for Covid-19. Cook, cook, cook. Bleach this, sterilise that. I’ve got the Magimix out for the first time in years, trying to do a rudimentary banana bread with strong flour, having not found, during this war, the correct GI to have sex with in order to procure a 1kg bag of self-raising. The judder of the blades pulverising sweetly decaying bananas drowns out morbid thoughts about my friends potentially dying in the vast Whittington Hospital down the road. It also nulls the thoughts of my other half’s much-loved rabbi dying suddenly last weekend, after appearing unwell in shul and then quickly gone, or my brother’s friend with Parkinson’s dying in intensive care.The silver lining to this – glimmering ever so weakly – is that I have not wasted those decaying bananas. Oh no. Bananas ticked off my list. For my next trick I will be making a cheering set of scones using the wrong flour and a box of Trex cooking fat that predates Siobhán’s first time in the Sugababes.“How are you doing?” my friends ask each other constantly on WhatsApp, checking in, our friendship meaning more than it ever has before. In my case, it depends on when you ask me. Yesterday, I was in my Covid-19 mode where I would be played by Nicola Walker: subdued, bubblingly furious, underslept with eyes that have seen so much, breakfasting and lunching on Maxwell House sachets stolen from hotel rooms and Nutella out of the jar with a dessert spoon, all while trying to weigh up what will kill one of my family members first: the lack of chemo or the Covid-19 they catch while having it? This decision feels above my pay grade. Where can I buy a hazmat suit online? “Can we drive them to the front door wrapped in clingfilm, and I’ll sit in the boot?” I suggest to my brother at one point. It felt, in that moment, a reasonable question. Afterwards, I had freezer-bread toast and cracked open my emergency raspberry jam.My favourite lockdown persona, which I save especially for supermarkets, is Tina Turner as Aunty Entity in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Sure, this dystopian world is upon us, but I will survive. I’ll be pivotal in Earth’s rebuilding, as well as glamorous and Amazonian. Asda is my Bartertown if I move before dawn, under cover of darkness, I can stock up on couscous and even hand sanitiser.My most nauseating lockdown hours, meanwhile, are the ones I spend channelling Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop newsletter, because, like, if you think about it, maybe Covid-19 is, like, a chance to totally emotionally recentre and focus on nourishment and healing. During this time, I listen to my Tara Brach “radical acceptance” guided meditations while shredding cauliflower leaves before sauteeing them with shallot and carrot, adding a handful of barley and simmering in low-sodium Marigold vegetable bouillon. Immunity is so important. “Jesus Christ, it’s a good job you’re self-isolating alone,” one friend says. “Maybe sleep with a window ajar.”Because of my other half’s high-risk job, we are apart for the foreseeable, but then many people all over the world right now are in peculiar situations. Homes split, mealtimes fractured. Alone, apart, but also, at the same time, together. On last night’s Zoom chat, an anniversary, he was sitting in his pants after work, eating some godforsaken cut of an animal he’d found in his freezer, drinking a beer and listening to the awful, trumpet-heavy jazz that he likes and that I loathe because it makes me feel as if I’m being chased by bees. He was planning on watching a Jason Statham movie.“Are you missing me?” I asked.“Yes,” he replied, “I am having a terrible time.”“This could go on for months,” I said.“I know,” he said, a small flicker of bliss dancing about his lips. We’re all in a dire situation. But look out for those silver linings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23922618f7aff34316b0c7f741133ad847192fe1/0_41_3451_2072/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5c27bbf0b534a2a18a197eebd850a4e","title":"coronavirus priorities what we leave behind","story":"How times of struggle can pave the way for new ways of life – and for the lucky ones among us, the quest for small joysIn an essay published last week in The Point magazine, Justin EH Smith, a professor of history and philosophy at the University of Paris, made an interesting observation about life in quarantine. Without downplaying the tragedies of the current pandemic, Smith, who is “fairly sure” he is experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 as he writes, observes “there is liberation in this suspension of more or less everything”.“Any fashion, sensibility, ideology, set of priorities, worldview or hobby that you acquired prior to March 2020, and that may have by then started to seem to you cumbersome, dull, inauthentic, a drag: you are no longer beholden to it,” he writes. “You can cast it off entirely and no one will care likely, no one will notice.”For Smith, what has come to ring false is his book – a work in progress on the deleterious effects of the internet on community, a subject he’s lost passion for as Zoom and FaceTime prove that sometimes, technology is the only thing that can keep us together.As Smith implies, disruption and isolation have a way of encouraging us to electively re-evaluate our lives – and that can be generative.Out of curiosity, I briefly surveyed friends and colleagues on whether they have abandoned habits or behaviors during this pandemic they have no interest in resuming. Many have.A friend told me the imperative to not touch his face finally helped him break a decades-old nail-biting habit. Another, a self-professed “big online shopper”, has gone cold turkey on luxury consumerism and hopes to never resume her blithe ordering of designer clothes again. “I really don’t need more things. I don’t need a Louis Vuitton purse,” she admitted.On the news, I read about everything from “Coviorces” to society’s collective disenchantment with celebrity during the pandemic. For everything that’s become inaccessible to us, there’s something else we’re simply over.According to Dr Susan David, a Harvard psychologist and host of a new Ted podcast series on coping emotionally with the pandemic, living through a crisis can be genuinely formative. “People who’ve gone through trauma or struggle in the way that we are experiencing now, that struggle can simultaneously be distressing, and there is enormous growth and power that can come from it,” she says.In addition to describing greater levels of empathy and personal wellbeing, David says that people who live introspectively through crises “recognize aspects of their life that they once thought were significant, like what they were wearing and what they were buying, that are now actually kind of petty”.Collectively, we may be experiencing a great reconsidering of priorities, the lasting effects of which will not only be personal, but economic. As a result, market researchers such as Alex Quicho, the associate director of cultural intelligence at Canvas8, are closely monitoring how our post-pandemic selves will navigate the world.“Even as they’re experiencing grief as the virus impacts their loved ones, or if their lives are relatively untouched by it, people will be facing isolation, boredom and a need for small joy,” says Quicho. “That’s where we end up seeing a lot of habit change, and the formation of new habits. It is also where people will almost be forced to reconsider the life they had prior. A lot of things will be streamlined or lost, they’ll be driven to give up impulse shopping, or going for a walk and buying things, or going for a daily coffee or a smoke,” she explains.In the coming months we will grow to understand the long-term effects of social distancing. Given experts’ anticipation that the safety measures we’re taking today will become a part of society’s “new normal”, with reoccurring periods of quarantine lockdown, it follows that we, like our world, will change. We are all sharing in misfortune hopefully we will find some liberation, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8202280af79ca3b3328b78a07ed15f2f8b52ad23/0_1226_5461_3277/master/5461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=341621d99280c8b78684aeec7ff24ad2","title":"experience i am a 13 time world champion real tennis","story":"I’m 51, my ankles are wrecked and I’m in pain for weeks after a tournamentAt 17, I was thinking of going to university to study economics when I saw an advert in my local paper looking for someone to help run the real tennis club in Hobart, Tasmania. I didn’t know much about real tennis, which has been played since the 16th century but is very different from tennis. The advert specified someone with good racket skills, and as I’d been playing modern lawn tennis since I was nine, and was the No 1 tennis junior in the state, I couldn’t resist.Real tennis is the game from which racket sports evolved, but requires different skills from lawn tennis. Courts and rackets are asymmetrical and the balls are cork, so are heavier and less bouncy. Serving is done on to a sloping roof and the scoring system can seem complicated to newcomers. There was a lot to learn, but absorbing the rules and physics was part of the appeal. My job involved tasks such as stocking the fridge, but the club also wanted someone who could learn the role of a professional, play against members and eventually coach. The more mundane aspects faded into the background as my game improved.By my early 20s I was playing real tennis internationally, although there are fewer than 50 courts in the world, with most in the UK. It can be tough maintaining a career in a game that isn’t widely known: the prize money is respectable, but even the top players have other jobs. I’ve needed to carry on winning in order to keep things rolling financially.Early on, my greatest rival was New Yorker Wayne Davies. We met in the World Championship final in 1994. We played two 13-set matches, the first in Tasmania, which I won quite comfortably. The second, on Wayne’s home turf, was a different matter. The crowds are not huge, but they’re at closeq uarters. Having 250 New Yorkers screaming me down was the most intense situation I’d experienced during my career, but I scraped through and became world champion for the first time.I was euphoric at reaching the top, of course, but also well aware I couldn’t rest easy if I wanted to stay there. I was 25 and could rely, to some extent, on my athleticism. I continued to win successive world championships but had to focus on strategy as I entered my 30s and 40s.Given the relative obscurity of the game, you can’t depend on a full house for every match. During one US Open, I played a Wednesday afternoon fixture in front of an audience of one – the other player’s girlfriend. Inevitably, she was pretty biased, but I managed to win the match.I met my wife Claire at a real tennis event – she was a highly regarded up-and-coming player and has been the women’s world champion for nine years. It’s good to have someone in the family who shares my passion for the game – other relatives turn up to matches, but I don’t think they’ll ever fully grasp the rules. If someone asks me what I do I often say I’m a photographer rather than spend the next four hours trying to explain it.One of my favourite matches was at Hampton Court against Tim Chisholm in 2002. It was thrilling to face him at Henry VIII’s court – Henry was a real tennis enthusiast. That game went down to the wire, we were playing the best of 13 sets and ended up at six-all on day three. By that stage, we were physically and mentally battered I won, but I don’t remember a single shot.The real tennis world championship takes place every other year and I’ll compete for the last time next month. I’ve been world champion 13 times it would be great to make it to 14 before bowing out, but either way, this is the right time. I’m 51, and though I’m better at the game than I was in 1994, I’ve obviously lost most of the athleticism that goes with being 25. My knees aren’t too bad, but my ankles are wrecked – I’m in pain for weeks after a tournament.I’d rather spend more of my time coaching new players and promoting the game (I’d love to see it offered by more schools) and to create a glass show court that could tour the world. Claire and I have a young family, and run the Prested Hall Real Tennis Club in Essex. I’ll always be involved in the sport, but I don’t want to be one of those guys who pops his clogs on court in his 90s.• As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

However, he has a problem that irks me beyond belief: he stares at (pretty) women incessantly, to the point where he zones out of our conversations to look at them.

Fact-checking organisations often find that people are reluctant to change their mind once convinced of an issue if they are simply told they are wrong, despite international agencies finding there are no health risks associated with 5G and no link to coronavirus. There is also the risk that declining trust in mainstream media means that attempts to stop the claims spreading are seen as a cover-up.In the case of Uckfield FM, Ofcom reported that the guest also used her appearance to launch a lengthy attack on health professionals in the NHS dealing with the pandemic.She said: “Just because you have this qualification, do not wear that like a crown of glory … The days are gone when you were a doctor and a nurse and everybody trusted you. Those days are well gone. Do your own research. Do not trust a qualification. I know many people who are very qualified who know very little. Because remember the people that own the establishments that teach us, it all travels back to the same thing. It’s all owned by big pharma. They own the medical elite and they determine what gets published.”Ofcom decided that the 20-minute interview with a person purporting to be an authoritative health figure who was not sufficiently challenged posed a significant risk to public health at a time of national crisis. It ordered the station to broadcast an apology in a manner of regulator’s choosing and warned other outlets that it would be stepping up monitoring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00be7cea913a27c3a9a2c55567cad4abbc998125/0_0_2048_1230/master/2048..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=300d30be860b9232b4356c2336df5606","title":"loan credit card payments frozen uk financial regulator coronavirus","story":"Financial regulator fast-tracks measures to help consumers during coronavirus crisisThe financial regulator has announced plans to freeze loan and credit card payments for up to three months as part of emergency measures for consumers impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.The measures, which would usually require a lengthy consultation, could come into force as soon as 9 April. The Financial Conduct Authority said the process was being fast-tracked “given the national emergency and the significant impact on consumers’ finances right now”.It is aimed at consumers and renters who are not benefiting from existing relief measures that have targeted homeowners – with mortgage payment holidays – or business owners.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The proposals include a temporary freeze on loan and credit card payments for consumers who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the outbreak.The FCA said consumers who were at risk of having their credit cards suspended because of the regulator’s new affordability rules would not lose access to their accounts.Lenders would also have to waive interest charges on arranged overdrafts up to £500 over the same period, which would extend relief already announced by some banks including Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds.But the FCA’s emergency measures force firms to make sure all customers are “no worse off” due to the changes, meaning some customers may revert to lower interest rates.Banks and credit card providers will have to ensure that consumer credit ratings are unaffected by any of the measures, the FCA said.The FCA’s interim chief executive, Christopher Woolard, said: “Coronavirus has caused an unprecedented financial shock with far-reaching consequences for consumers in every corner of the UK.“If confirmed, this package of measures we are proposing today will help provide affected consumers with the temporary financial support they need to help them weather the storm during this challenging time.”The news has been welcomed by consumer advocates including Martin Lewis, who said it would help level the playing field for customers who may not have time to shop around for better rates during the crisis.Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “We have already seen many unsecured lenders put some forbearance criteria in place … However the provision is patchy and has become a banking lottery and that’s unfair – no one could have taken into account when they signed up for products how considerate each lender would be in these extraordinary times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92490448b4d306d0c7861c5b458c6ca3a9f33b53/0_167_7382_4426/master/7382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2846ee4f9914d99bddeee5d6ad215f1","title":"dua lipa you have to be made of steel to not let words get to you","story":"Two years after New Rules made her a global star, Dua Lipa is back with an album of sheer disco pop perfection – and plenty to say about sex, politics and her night in a strip club with LizzoDua Lipa knew two things before starting the follow-up to her massive self-titled 2017 debut: she would call it Future Nostalgia, and it would be “an album that was really fun and made me wanna dance and removed the outside world”, she says. Few albums have fulfilled their intended purpose faster. Future Nostalgia was meant to arrive today, until an online leak brought it forward to the first Friday of Britain’s coronavirus lockdown. Lipa wasn’t sure it felt right to release it during the pandemic, but accurately concluded that her brilliant disco-wreathed anthems-in-waiting – the kind that transform kitchen tiles into a makeshift Studio 54 – might distract fans from the news.At the very least, a day of radio interviews and unceasing congrats stopped the 24-year-old from stressing about when to take her government-sanctioned daily walk. We FaceTime in the early evening of Future Nostalgia’s premature birthday, Lipa at ease in a Christopher Kane “Techno Sexual” jumper, modish straw-on-tarmac hair tied up, saucer eyes unadorned. Like everyone, she has been self-isolating, eating chips and watching Tiger King. Unlike everyone, she is doing it in a plush Airbnb (her London flat flooded) with her model boyfriend Anwar Hadid (brother of models Gigi and Bella). Later, she will be conference-calling friends and family to “drink and dance through the phone”.Although Lipa says today has felt like Christmas, it is still an anticlimactic arrival for an album that the British music industry has been banking on. Hers is the rare homegrown success not belonging to anyone named Sheeran or Adele, born from no-nonsense mega-pop in the vein of Britney and her idol Pink. In 2017, Lipa was the most-streamed female musician in the world. A year later, she became the first female solo artist to get five Brits nominations (she won two), and the youngest woman to break 1bn YouTube views with her video for New Rules, the single that transformed her from pop journeywoman to superstar. This January, it hit 2bn.Success creates freedom and pressure, says Lipa. At 11 tracks, the focused Future Nostalgia bucks pop’s trend for bloated, spread-betting albums that try to please all-comers. But her initial intention for the record – to have fun and ignore the world – came after online criticism threatened to dent her self-worth. “People almost made me feel bad about my achievements, or didn’t allow me to feel proud of the things that I’ve done because they made me feel like I was almost unworthy of them,” she says. “Even though I know I’ve worked really hard and I did so much of the work, the performances and behind the scenes.”There are two key words here, the first being “almost”: Lipa is indomitable, not given to vulnerability, or at least not to showing it. The second is “work”: Lipa’s parents are Kosovar and Bosnian Muslim immigrants who fled war-torn Kosovo for the UK in 1992. She was born in 1995, and lived in London until the family returned to Pristina when she was 10. At 15, she came back to pursue pop stardom, persuading her parents she would have a better chance of getting into a British university if she finished school here. Where most kids would go wild, Lipa grafted, pestered people with her demos and became an assiduous networker (the Instagram page for Girls Collective, a DIY talent agency she started with five friends, is still live). One connection led to another and she signed first with Lana Del Rey’s management team, then to Warner Music.It took two years from releasing her debut single, Hotter Than Hell – showing off her trademark bungee-jump vocals and ex-vanquishing MO – to her first album. The latter was repeatedly delayed, Lipa a prime study of how pop careers build slowly and evolve publicly in the streaming era – and living proof of the “adaptability” she admired in her parents. “With every song, the momentum was building, but only tiny little bits,” she says. “I was doing new things, I was learning what was expected of me, how to be in front of a camera, how to better the last performance.”But her singles were not charting well. By the time she released two successive collaborations – modern pop’s stabilisers – fans worried she was destined for pop’s dumper. Then she unleashed the video to New Rules, “and it was like rocket fuel”, she says, a feminist sleepover fever dream and instant classic. It takes place in a luxury Miami Beach hotel, which she approached to fund the video, not because her label had shut its wallet, but in a savvy cash grab that let her “push it to another level”. She never doubted her career prospects. “I just didn’t think it was gonna happen like this.”Reflecting pop’s long game, Lipa won the Grammy for best new artist in 2019. The backlash took flight. “People being like: ‘She’s been fucking best new artist for so long and she doesn’t deserve that, blah blah blah,’” she recalls. “There were times that I felt people were being so mean that when someone recognised me and said: ‘I really like your music,’ I’d be like: ‘Oh my God, not everyone hates me!’” She says this with self-aware melodrama, though it echoes recent sentiments from Billie Eilish and Britney Spears: how dismal it must feel to see your hard work burned up by hatred.Lipa hopes the #BeKind movement sparked by Caroline Flack’s death might improve online discourse. “The scrutiny not just on social media but in the media, especially towards women, is so intense and unkind and really trying to get a rise out of people,” she says. “The tabloids know very well what they’re doing, and it really affects everyone. You have to be made out of steel to not let words get to you. It’s so sad that we have to learn lessons from somebody’s death.”But then, maybe we are a long way off when, as Lipa says, “certain leaders are inciting racism and almost making it acceptable for people to be racist and treating people in very vile and disgusting ways”. British political parties are “absolutely” sowing such ision, she says. “You have people like Nigel Farage, who is very openly racist and that is just shocking, and there are people who beat around the bush. They’re racist but – it’s such a mindfuck – they have a lot of people fooled.”Lipa is unusually specific about politics for a pop star of her stature. It’s not just “vote”, it’s “vote Labour”, or “vote Bernie”, or “FUCK THE PATRIARCHY I AM DONE WITH THIS BULLSHIT HANDMAIDS TALE SHIT WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK” after Alabama banned abortion. She credits her parents for her voice, saying she was raised “really liberal”. She is most concerned about UK immigration policy post-Brexit. Had it existed in the 90s, she thinks it would have stopped the Lipas fleeing Kosovo (where her mum was a lawyer, her dad a dentist-in-training) for the UK, where they worked as waiters and studied for new careers.“It upsets me that probably some of the younger generations of refugees don’t really have the same opportunities that I was given because of the fortunate – or unfortunate – fact that my parents moved to London and I was born here and able to live my dream and do something on a global scale,” she says. Whether post-Brexit Britain still offers those opportunities, “we’re gonna have to see how everything works out”, she says cautiously. Brexit has been upsetting: “Being from Kosovo, I know what it would mean for them to be a part of the EU and be accepted.”It is an obvious thing to say about someone who frequently entertains packed arenas, but Lipa evidently wants to be heard. Although she occasionally jumps into the conversational deep end but grips the safety rail (a devout Labour supporter, she indicates that she is no Corbyn fan, but won’t say so outright), she sticks to her chosen guns. She kept Future Nostalgia relatively short to hold listeners’ attention s. “I really wanted to make sure there wasn’t any tracks you could skip,” she grins.Pop’s detractors like to point out that it is an industry where artists conform to conventions. In the immortal words of Eilish: duh. Lipa is a canny operator who understood that she had to play a certain game to reach the point where she could be herself. (Her ambitionachievement conversion rate is a big part of her aspirational appeal.) Lipa was surprised by the under-recognition of female talent at this year’s Brits – evidence, critics said, of the British industry’s inability to develop female talent – but she is pragmatic about what might seem like a conservative feeder system where new acts spew out singles and accept every possible collaboration. “Artists that are already well known get the upper hand, so you do have to get on those playlists as much as possible to be heard,” she says.Following Lipa’s success, one such feeder system seemed to be getting young female acts to make their version of New Rules: Mabel’s Don’t Call Me Up, Ella Eyre’s New Me and Anne-Marie’s Friends to name just three. (Incidentally, New Rules is the only one of Lipa’s songs that she hasn’t had a hand in writing.) She must have noticed. “Er, have I noticed …? I don’t know if I’ve noticed …” she says, her game face dropping to reveal that she has absolutely noticed. “But that’s OK, though!” she says when called on it. “There’s lots of different ways to say the same thing, make it honest and unique to you.” She resists the idea that anyone is being told to recreate someone else’s success. “Artists do have a lot of control.”Had Lipa tried to recreate New Rules for album two, “I’d just be in a vicious cycle”, she says. She says she struggled to find her “lyrical language” on her debut, feeling more at ease writing sad songs. “I learned that I could write happy songs that are still really authentic and have the possibility of being cool and not seen as bubblegum.” Most striking is how she sings about sex: mutually pleasurable, orgasmic transcendence mirrored in dazzling disco reveries. On Good in Bed, she nonchalantly celebrates “all that good pipe in the moonlight” from a toxic ex-with-benefits. “Everybody thinks that as a woman, you have to be so careful about how you portray yourself or how you talk about sex, and everything has to be really sweet,” she says mockingly. “It’s just very colloquial and how I chat with my mates.”Future Nostalgia ends with its lone ballad, the weighty Boys Will Be Boys, where a children’s choir backs Lipa singing about how girls grow up faster in a world of male violence. She wanted to make something that felt like the moment the lights go on at the end of a party, “so it would almost end a bit abruptly and maybe make you feel uncomfortable”. She has grown less accommodating, a dynamic she dealt with in real life in January, when she attended Lizzo’s Grammys afterparty at an LA strip club. After they were filmed throwing money at dancers with Rosalía, Lipa was accused of exploiting women, sparking the hashtag #dualipaisoverparty where users revelled in her “cancellation”.Lipa – who no longer goes on Twitter – did not respond. “I don’t like to apologise if I don’t believe I should be apologising for something,” she says now. “I believe in supporting women in all fields of work. Nothing at that party was derogatory everyone was just dancing and having fun.” In our supposedly enlightened culture about sex work, she was surprised by the prudish response. “That’s something we all have to work on,” she says. “Not every sex worker is being forced to do something they don’t wanna do. I think a lot of the women found it really empowering and really like to dance.”Women’s work is always undermined, says Lipa. “We all have to work a little bit harder to be taken seriously, but it’s not something that we’re not used to doing,” she says, rolling her eyes and grinning. She has pointedly described Future Nostalgia as “fun” even though she knows that is exactly the stick critics use to beat it with that women in pop are only judged as “authentic” when they are weeping by the piano. “Time always tells,” she shrugs. “And in the meantime, I’ll just work for people to take me seriously.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db086f2df97debb3f1c95779021e1532b78671c7/488_818_5303_3182/master/5303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ce11aed7ba1fbf2b15d2dd132a5dca","title":"muzz track of the week","story":"This week we’ve got Interpol scowler Paul Banks, the return of MIA and Warp’s latest rock bandLife is very long, isn’t it?

These will be a combination of tests for live cases of the virus and antibody tests to determine whether someone has previously been infected. Germany is carrying out around 70,000 tests a day, all for live cases of Covid-19.However, the government was also forced to acknowledge it was not likely to have the capacity to embark on a programme of mass testing for live cases in the general public, as advocated by the World Health Organization and public experts.Instead, No 10 and health department sources confirmed the general public would primarily have to rely on the potential for an antibody test – but these are “ideally” done 28 days after an infection, to give the clearest indication of whether someone has already had the virus, according to Prof John Newton, a senior Public Health England official.Newton said the idea of testing all those that have symptoms in the country was “unrealistic” and the as yet unproven antibody test was more likely to be used by people at home.Hancock said work was progressing with the antibody tests but that the results of many of the early tests had been “poor” and he was more hopeful about later ones that have been acquired. The government has bought options on up to 17.5m antibody tests of different types that are currently being tested, but cannot say definitively when they will be safe to use.When the antibody tests are available, Hancock said, the government was looking at the possibility of issuing immunity certificates, so that some of the population “can get back to work as much as possible”.However, some critics fear that this could lead to resentment in the population who have not had the virus, and that people might even deliberately try to get infected in order to obtain an immunity certificate.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, told the  that immunity certificates for frontline medical workers would be crucial for allowing staff to return to work and allowing personal protective equipment to be rationed in the safest way.However, in the wider population, fraud could be an issue, which could rule out home-based testing, and there were concerns about unintended consequences. “People going out to deliberately get infected so they could get back to work is a concern and I don’t know how you’d avoid that,” he said. “Those are big issues.”After a week spent in isolation with coronavirus himself, Hancock was forced to defend the government on numerous fronts. He told the press briefing:Tensions have bubbled in Whitehall over who is to blame for low testing numbers in the UK, with some political sources blaming Public Health England (PHE) for not placing enough emphasis on the issue in recent weeks.However, PHE rejected criticism that it had been trying to do all the testing itself and was too inflexible in which chemicals were allowed to be used, suggesting that it was the responsibility of ministers to find private capacity for more tests.Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director of the public health body, said PHE’s role was to “make sure our labs are doing what they need to do” in terms of testing hospital patients with a clinical need, with NHS staff a second priority.Conservative backbenchers voiced concern in private about the government’s failure to roll out testing faster, saying there was anxiety that the public mood could turn against the government if it appeared there was no end to the lockdown as a result.A former supporter Johnson in the leadership contest said they were worried sentiment could turn rapidly: “I think the government could get blown away if people are still inside after Easter and there is no progress on testing.”Concerns were voiced that Johnson and other ministers had appeared to allow PHE to lead on testing, without asking the independent researchers and the private sector to get involved until Hancock’s announcement. “The fact that there’s not mass testing now is inexcusable,” another Conservative MP complained.One senior MP said the party would be watching the polls closely and that he was “frankly amazed” that Johnson’s popularity was holding up. A bit like the virus, there might be a two-week lag before the public comes to fully realise that the government is failing to get the testing issue under control, they said.“There are some in my party who are trying to blame PHE, but ultimately, it will be the politicians who get the blame if the economy collapses because we can’t test NHS workers.“The death toll will become totemic. If we get thousands of people dying every day for several days, who knows where this will go. It is frightening, and the prime minister looks like he doesn’t know what to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3c86e9cd458d52cb9d1df72f9aeff669130a3f/0_45_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af2ec4400eb26626525571c409ee044d","title":"next labour leader should back proportional representation say greens","story":"Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley write to leadership candidates urging switch to PRLabour’s leadership candidates should back sweeping reforms of the UK’s electoral system and pledge to bring in proportional representation if elected, the Green party has urged.Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley, co-leaders of the Green party, have written to the three candidates offering support and dialogue “in the collegiate spirit these times demand” and asking each of them to endorse a shift to a form of PR voting.“We cannot continue to allow our democracy to be warped by a system where many are excluded, policy is not led by those whose voices should be heard, and where votes do not match seats,” they say.Three-quarters of Labour party members support proportional representation, according to a YouGov poll conducted shortly after last December’s general election, which produced Labour’s worst showing since 1935. But the party has fought shy of wholeheartedly adopting the policy.The Labour leadership campaign, muted in its final weeks by the coronavirus crisis, closed on Thursday and the winner among the final three candidates – frontrunner Sir Keir Starmer, the pro-Corbyn Rebecca Long-Bailey and outsider Lisa Nandy – will be announced on Saturday.Berry told the  the Covid-19 emergency had highlighted the problems with the  first-past-the-post system, which is predicated on two-party dominance. She said the crisis meant voters wanted their elected representatives to work together, but the system discourages cooperation.The climate crisis, which all three Labour candidates have promised to prioritise, was a key example of a vital issue that cut across traditional party lines, but on which cooperation had been stifled by the current system, she said. “Just like coronavirus, there is no way we are going to be able to tackle the climate emergency without working together, and the outdated first-past-the-post system is seriously hindering our ability to do that.”All three Labour candidates have indicated support for electoral reform, without giving detailed plans. Starmer has called for a new constitutional convention to address issues including “the fact that millions of people vote in safe seats and feel their voice doesn’t count”. Long-Bailey has also backed a constitutional convention without explicitly recommending PR for the House of Commons, and Nandy has voiced some support but stopped short of full backing.“All voters benefit from a fairer electoral system, no matter which party they support, because if votes match seats then people’s views really matter and our democracy is strengthened,” said Berry. Support for smaller parties is artificially suppressed under first-past-the-post, as voters choose the least-worst option if they feel their preferred candidate has little chance of winning.The experience of the coronavirus crisis will increase people’s appetite for a fairer electoral system, Berry believes, giving the next Labour leader the opportunity to make sweeping changes to the party’s approach.She drew a parallel between workers who have often been undervalued in pay and by governments, and voters who do not feel they have much influence on politicians. “It is vital that the public trust their votes count and their voices will be heard.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1113e0ad5ae7c5e2da8324f33a7e95f9ebdfd61d/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=235bec96e6be1b8602ffbd2cfa581e41","title":"labour leadership election the latest odds","story":"Keir Starmer continues to be the bookie’s favourite to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the opposition, and enjoyed a bounce after the weekend’s hustings.

Now, researchers say, they have found mice do too.“Mice exhibit facial expressions that are specific to the underlying emotions,” said Dr Nadine Gogolla, co-author of the research from Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology. She said the findings were important, as they offer researchers new ways to measure the intensity of emotional responses, which could help them probe how emotions arise in the brain.What’s more, she said, the findings show mice have a repertoire of emotions. Writing in the journal Science, Gogolla and colleagues report that they exposed mice to a mixture of triggers. These included electric shocks to the tail, sweet treats, and lithium chloride injections, which induced a state akin to nausea.While the authors say the facial movements that followed were noticeable, anyone hoping for a comical murine grimace may be disappointed.Indeed, rather like Ben Stiller’s Zoolander, the expressions appear very similar to the human eye – albeit with subtle differences. For example, compared with a neutral expression, a mouse’s ears lay further back and the position of its lower jaw and nose shifted when it had its tail zapped.To probe these expressions further, the team turned to computer vision technology that extracts features from different images, and quantifies differences between pictures.The software revealed clear differences between images of mice taken from before and after each trigger was applied, as well as differences between images captured during different types of trigger, suggesting the facial expression linked to a zapped tail was different to that manifested when a treat was given.Further work using average facial feature data relating to each trigger confirmed this, something the team say shows that the expressions reflect different emotional states, such as pleasure, disgust, nausea and pain – although fear linked to escape had a less distinct expression.The team also employed machine learning – a type of artificial intelligence that can recognise patterns and hence sort data into different groups.The team found that expressions could vary in duration and onset. while Mice pulled a stronger expression, relative to the average, when they were given a sweet sucrose drink when thirsty compared with when they were quenched. “It is not just a sucrose face we are eliciting,” said Gogolla. “The pleasure is higher when you are actually thirsty.”In a further twist, the team looked at brain regions previously associated with emotions in animals including mice, finding that if they stimulated areas linked to particular emotions, the mouse pulled the expected corresponding face. Again, machine learning could tell these apart.In their accompanying commentary, Dr Benoit Girard and Prof Camilla Bellone of the University of Geneva say the new research could not only open up new ways to probe how emotions arise in the brain, but could also help researchers explore whether animals share information through their facial expressions, and how and why experiences of emotions may differ between iniduals.But Dr Susanne Schweizer, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the work, said it was unclear whether the facial expressions of the mice truly reflected emotions, since they relate to short-lived physical experiences.“How do these experiences – if at all – relate to the emotional pain experienced when we are faced with loss, the pleasure we experience when we see a loved one succeed, or the sense of disgust we are overcome with when we hear about a moral transgression?” she said. “It would be fascinating to see if the effects can be reliably replicated in response to social stressors and positive social stimuli in mice.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c06d6b60eca308cf27c49b3b3f2e1bc6fe06f1d6/0_352_5226_3136/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=395bca1e892680868639f7fd02e5b21b","title":"impose strict curbs on gambling during covid 19 lockdown mps urge","story":"Industry’s proposals are ‘weak’ and government must act to help those at risk, group saysMore than 20 MPs have called for strict curbs on gambling during the Covid-19 lockdown, including a moratorium on advertising, calling the betting industry’s own proposals “very weak”.The Betting \u0026amp Gaming Council (BGC) issued a 10-point pledge last week, promising extra steps to ensure that firms do not exploit vulnerable people and addicts who may be at increased risk due to the inertia inherent in staying at home for long periods.But in a letter to the government – and the BGC – 22 MPs, two Lords and one of the UK’s foremost gambling addiction experts said the measures put forward by the trade body were either weak, vague or already formed part of requirements of their licence to operate.“People are at home and are severely restricted, with access to mini-casinos on their laptops or mobile phones,” they wrote in a letter to Nigel Huddleston, the minister responsible for gambling. “We therefore have deep concerns about the ‘pledges’ which have been proposed this week by the BGC.”They called on the government to urge the industry to adopt five measures during the Covid-19 lockdown, including an end to controversial VIP schemes that reward heavy losses and a suspension of advertising and bonus offers.Stakes on “highly dangerous” slot games should be limited to £2, they recommended, while the industry should impose mandatory limits on betting account deposits, rather than simply encouraging customers to set their own.They also called on companies to release internal data to independent researchers to help them assess the scale of harm caused by gambling during the coronavirus outbreak compared with normal circumstances.The group of MPs, from across the political spectrum, includes the former sports minister Tracey Crouch, whose resignation from Theresa May’s government in 2018 triggered a successful cross-party rebellion against a planned delay to curbs on maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs).It also includes longstanding gambling campaigners such as Labour’s Carolyn Harris, former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and the Scottish National party’s Ronnie Cowan.Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, director of the National Problem Gambling Clinic, also signed the letter. She said: “The UK does not shield its young and vulnerable from gambling advertising despite research showing that exposure to gambling will act as a trigger to gamble even in young people. This is not in keeping with a public health approach.“Our country has at least 50,000 children who are problem gamblers. With the current lockdown, many more will be tempted by boredom and financial concerns to try gambling as a way out. Now, more than ever, at this time of uncertainty, a moral code is required from the gambling industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af948544da0068cd3bd80cbe89dddb3d0e1c6301/113_0_1800_1081/master/1800..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ae5a23578e5efd95962913361c32cb5","title":"coronavirus lockdown how readers are keeping fit shutdown staying active","story":"Want to stay active during the coronavirus shutdown?

Usually I go on small walks at my own pace at Roundhay Park in Leeds, but obviously that is harder now. I used to be a Paralympic swimmer and I like to keep fit and feel strong. I had to figure out a way to exercise and was inspired by the restaurant worker in France, Elisha Nochomovitz, and the marathon he ran on his seven-metre long balcony.At the back of my house is a small courtyard, around seven metres across. I challenged myself, not to walk a marathon, but to walk a mile a day, back and forth across the courtyard. I’m on my seventh day now and it feels wonderful to have the sun on my face, breathing in the fresh air. I’m sleeping better because of the exercise. And the added bonus is that I can still do this, at my own pace, with my prosthetic leg. I’ve been putting up videos of me doing a silly walk to celebrate my mile for the day.

My current performance for the 25-minute ride is seven miles and 200kj of work (doesn’t mean anything to me either) at average of just under 17mph and heart rate averaging 114 with max 134. Because you can’t coast downhill and there are no traffic lights or junctions, time on a trainer is equivalent to a longer time on the road. My advice is don’t be disappointed when you start. It takes time to become fit. Take it gently and it comes bit by bit. Relax into it.Before all this current unpleasantness, I had thought I was fit and healthy. Then I activated my step counter on my phone. Oh dear. I detest working out. So, while washing up or cooking, I dance to BBC Radio 6. Normally, I’m a bit of a smooth mover but to get the energy levels up I’ve found “auntie first up on the dancefloor at a wedding” mode is the best. Big thumpy steps, finger pointing, that kind of thing. Really cheery too.I walk around my village using little-known footpaths. I do about 12,000 steps in two hours and consume 650 calories. It’s beautiful, it’s therapeutic and it’s healthy. My weight has come down a stone and my blood pressure has dropped about 25 points. I feel great. Hew, MK43A state of emergency has been declared here in Thailand, where I live in a 22-floor apartment block. I have been running (well, mostly walking) up the stairs in the fire escape. My target is 163 floors in a day as that is the number in the Burj Khalifa skyscraper, the tallest building in the world. I can tell you this: it’s much tougher than I thought. Robert, Bangkok.It has been walks with the dog and the vegetable garden for me. The weather has been very good, giving me the time to get started with some vegetables I haven’t grown in a while – beans, cabbage, cauliflower, calabrese, that sort of thing. The seedlings are just starting to appear and they are all over the house. The onions and garlic are poking their heads up now, and my spuds went in yesterday. It will be a change not to have a garden knee-deep in grass and weeds at the end of May! Hazel, RishworthWe have put the exercise bike (which everybody hated) in the garden. It is now hugely appreciated. We can even read while cycling. I also bought four badminton rackets. Great family fun. Dominique, Edinburgh.I’ve started going for runs in a local, historic park. I usually go to the gym and have never really exercised outdoors before, but the weather has been beautiful and I’ve developed a love for running outside. I hope this continues when things get better. Rhiannon, Newcastle.I teach 13 pilates classes a week in local community halls, where my eldest clients are in their 80s. We have switched to online classes via Zoom, using a makeshift “studio” in my lounge. Most of my clients are still joining me from their lounges, bedrooms, hallways and kitchens. I’m amazed at how many of us have embraced this current reality. Louise, Northampton.Sadly, rehearsal rooms are closed. But I need to keep up with my hyperblasting black metal assaults, otherwise my impressive frame will be far less hench once the apocalypse is over. Hope the downstairs neighbours are alright, I do stomp the pedals pretty hard. Davydd, Salford Quays.I’m 71 in June. I have a treadmill and spinning bike at home and am walking with my wife. Today I ran on the treadmill and then went for a 20k bike ride around Regents Park in the sunshine. I’m finding it harder to put together a satisfactory core strengthening programme at home without equipment, but I am persevering. David, London.We are doing “Bury St Edmunds to Berlin” through exercise. We chose Berlin as it’s our favourite place we’ve visited in the last year. We are either cycling or running for our daily outdoor exercise, and then using a rowing machine at home. Eleanor, Bury St Edmunds.I am climbing national monuments. Yesterday I climbed 1,665 steps to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The view was great. The Arc de Triomphe next! Jonathan, Cambrils.I’m walking the dog and skate boarding. Sometimes combining the two. Dave, Old Malden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0802b6e9b8b067c0894579103a2dc11c76030c13/3_156_1118_671/master/1118..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1de893e3dee12ee885ed654a6856063b","title":"magnus carlsens online tournament taps into new internet chess boom","story":"The world No 1, whose title defence may be delayed to 2021 after the Candidates was suspended, has launched an eight-player event with a prize fund of $250,000Magnus Carlsen, the world champion, aims to fill the void from the cancellation of over-the-board chess by launching an online super-tournament, starting on 18 April, where he will compete against seven of his major rivals, including the world Nos 2 and 3, Fabiano Cariana of the US and Ding Liren of China, for a $250,000 prize fund, easily a record for internet chess.The Magnus Carlsen Invitational is set to go ahead online at the website chess24. Invitees are Carlsen and seven other elite GMs, including Caruana and Ding, it will last until 2 May, and its format will be an all-play-all group stage of four-game mini-matches. Competitors will have 15 minutes for each game, plus 10 seconds for each move made. The top four players in the round robin will then compete in the knockout stage for the $70,000 first prize.A tournament of this scale online has never been organised before, and could revolutionise the sport. Several anti-cheating measures will be in force, including mandatory cameras viewing the players. There are also plans for online chess fans to get the chance to play the top competitors and the world champion himself. Every game will be broadcast online by chess24 with expert commentary in nine languages.Several million players already take part in online chess on three major websites. Interest has spiked in recent weeks due to people being forced to stay at home because of global lockdowns. Try it for yourself! For newcomers, I recommend lichess, where you can very quickly select your own time limit, find an opponent, and play a game all for free.Carlsen’s new move comes amid continued controversy over the eight-player Candidates to decide the Norwegian’s next challenger, which was aborted in Ekaterinburg last week after seven of its 14 rounds. France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave was leading on tie-break from Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi.Arkady Dvorkovich took a personal decision “after just a few seconds of thinking” to suspend play last Thursday when he learned that international flights out of Russia would be banned from the next day. The global body Fide’s president feared that the grandmasters from China, France, the Netherlands and the US would be stranded indefinitely.This is the third time in the last half-century that a Fide president has had to make such a decision, and the consequences of the previous two were momentous. In July 1972 Max Euwe bent the rules to allow Bobby Fischer to arrive late in Reykjavik to play Boris Spassky. The match still nearly foundered at the start, but Euwe’s judgment was vindicated when Fischer’s victory led to the greatest boom chess has ever known.In February 1985 the Fide president Florencio Campomanes stopped the first Anatoly Karpov v Garry Kasparov in Moscow when Karpov led 5-3 in a race to six wins but had just lost two in a row. It probably came after pressure from Soviet officials who feared that the exhausted Karpov would collapse, even though both players said they wanted to continue. The match was replayed later in 1985, Kasparov won, but he ceased to trust Fide and in 1993 he and Nigel Short launched a breakaway organisation which split the chess world for 12 years.Events proved that Campomanes probably got it wrong. Now in 2020 Dvorkovich seems not to have seriously considered continuing the Candidates until its scheduled finishing date of 4 April. There were stringent medical precautions in place, and thus a good chance that the event could have been concluded normally. Dvorkovich is a former deputy prime minister of Russia, and would have been in a position to pull strings in Moscow for a request to lift the flying ban for a single chartered flight to take the players out of Russia.Dvorkovich and Fide still plan to complete the Candidates, again in Ekaterinburg, later this year, but what if coronavirus persists for a long time? The world title match was scheduled for December 2020 at Expo Dubai, an event which now seems likely to be postponed until 2021. It would not be surprising if the conclusion of the Candidates was also to be delayed for 12 months, as all concerned still want the match to take place in Dubai.Teimour Radjabov qualified for the Candidates, withdrew citing virus fears, and now demands to be included if and when it continues. The Azerbaijani has many supporters, but Fide will not agree and the matter could end up in the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne.Carlsen, for his part, seems to be enjoying the argument: “Regardless of what happens, I’m not a victim. If I get to play a match that would be fun, it would be interesting, and if I get to sit on the title a bit more I’m not going to complain.”3665 1 gxh5! Nxh5 (Rxd4 holds out longer) 2 Rxf7!

With Cardiff’s sporting Asgard being rebuilt, the ageing London edifice teems with scarlet-clad fanatics determined to see English noses rubbed in their own hallowed turf. Tom Jones leads the choir with a lusty Bread of Heaven, stood alongside that cheeky bard of the valleys Max Boyce. Clear London skies cast long shadows in the late April afternoon.The feeling shared among the Welsh is that something is afoot, that Graham Henry’s men could poop the party and deny England a grand slam at the site of their footballing brethren’s greatest sporting triumph, 1966 and all that. How wonderful that would be.But, quietly, there are doubts, for Clive Woodward’s formidable England bristle with intent, marshalled by Lawrence Dallaglio, flanked by a youthful Martin Johnson and a baby-faced 19-year-old Jonny Wilkinson.Just to confirm Welsh fears England make a thunderous start, Matt Perry flashing from inside his own half, a quick pass to Dan Luger and over the line he speeds. Wales agog. Young Jonny converts and the Wembley scoreboard reads 0-7.But England have a flaw. Almost from the restart they concede a penalty and Neil Jenkins slots the kick. Wales’s metronome will keep his side hammering at the door every time the English put daylight on the scoreboard.It’s breathless as penalties are traded and, after 19 minutes, England are a point in front. They press hard and another of their teenagers, Steve Hanley, charges over to touch down on his debut. But, hold on, Wilkinson fluffs the conversion. 15-9 to England but will that uncharacteristic miss prove costly?Wales, undeterred, regather and bullocking through England ranks comes Craig “Mad Hippo” Quinnell. Jenkins strikes a beauty from the right touchline, his fourth. Then a fifth from almost the middle of the pitch, and on the half-hour Wales are level.Wilkinson answers that with an uprights-splitting arrow of his own and England make a bold statement before half-time. Matt Dawson kicks ahead and two Welsh defenders, transfixed by the ball’s arc, collide. Richard Hill claims the ball and slides over. Wilkinson converts and England are 10 points up. There’s still time for another penalty as Jenkins keeps his cool and Wales in contention.From the restart – at last – a score for Wales to cheer. Again it’s Jenkins at the fulcrum, lobbing a long pass out to his right and Shane Howarth crosses. The Ponty No10 converts: 25-all, just three minutes into the second half.England, affronted, surge back, claiming a penalty under the posts that Jonny slots … anything Jenks can do is the message. Then another and all the game’s protocols are forgotten as his kick is roundly booed. Still, it’s now 25-31 but as this Wembley thriller edges to 80 minutes the cold reality is all too clear to the Welsh: the steadfast black boot of Jenkins alone will not be sufficient to win this match.Wales are punished for dangerous play and England, scenting blood, kick to touch. The ball moves inside and Mike Catt lobs a high one towards the Welsh posts.Claim it and they must score – hard luck, boyos, but the title is England’s. But it is red 13, Mark Taylor, who grasps the ball and turns away, the game slipping into injury time.Wales’s redeemer arrives. Scott Gibbs is in full flight when the other Scott, the punk-haired Quinnell, sells England’s defenders with a slight of hand gleaned from rugby league and Gibbs, sidestepping, floating, motors through the gap, showboating for a heart- stopping moment, and touches down.One point in it, and here cometh Jenkins. A flutter of his hand and a swing of that redoubtable boot – the conversion is sweet perfection: 32-31. Victory belongs to Wales, to Gibbs and Jenkins and the travelling hoards, revelling in a first defeat of the old enemy since 1993."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a67d2eb926a45c7a01ef5192624989962633058/590_0_3555_2136/master/3555..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27b5c45d1820134937cc7dd99a9e83c1","title":"talking horses roll up for our answer to the grand national mystery","story":"What would have happened at Aintree on Saturday if the great race had gone ahead? We’ll give an answer at 3pm...It’s a tricky beast, this Virtual Grand National which so many of us will watch on Saturday (ITV, 5pm). Because of our reduced circumstances, it has become something to anticipate on about the same level as that half-pint of Carlsberg that John Mills sinks at the end of Ice Cold In Alex, but it cannot hope to be as satisfying, for all that an immense amount of work has clearly gone in to making it look convincing.The first odd thing is the runners list. In a normal year, the virtual race would be based around the entries made on the Monday before the National. But the race was abandoned weeks ago and the most recent entry stage that actually happened was at the end of February. So the producers have evidently decided to take the top 40 horses left in at that stage and accept them as the runners.In reality, a lot of the top 40 would have dropped out by this stage. Joe Farrell, who got a run in last year’s National, was 71st on the list at the end of February. It would have taken some nerve to go through the list, ejecting horses that might not have turned up at Aintree, and you always risk offending someone, but it would have been worth doing.Peregrine Run, whose pixelated form will be in this virtual race, is not actually qualified for the National, having never raced in a chase beyond 2m7f. Meanwhile, some very interesting potential runners have been shut out, including One For Arthur, who was 44th on the list in February and realistically sure to get a run as long as he stayed sound. The likes of Snugsborough Benny, Give Me A Copper, Lord Du Mesnil, Takingrisks, Borice and Le Breuil would also have been interesting contenders, had they been smuggled into the line-up at someone else’s expense.Someone has worked very hard on the jockey bookings but I raise an eyebrow at the appearance of Rachael Blackmore on Burrows Saint. She won a hurdles race on him at New Year when Paul Townend was on a more fancied runner from the Willie Mullins yard but Townend would still have had first choice and he surely would not have rejected last year’s Irish National winner in favour of Total Recall, whose odds are three times bigger.The Twitterati reckon this is ITV’s way of ensuring a National Velvet-like story. They might be right, too, because the three virtual Nationals so far have all fallen to fancied horses at 14-1 or shorter.Would Lisa O’Neill be on Shattered Love if Jamie Codd had no ride in the race? I doubt it. David Maxwell probably would have insisted on riding his Saint Xavier, but there’s no way he’d have made the weight of 10st 4lb. When he had to do 10st 7lb last season, he threatened to eat the horse in question afterwards. I’m afraid we have to put him down for 3lb overweight, or he’d be so light-headed that he might not make it across the first Melling Road.The virtual going description is reportedly ‘good’, which is slightly surprising, given that the policy at Aintree seems to be to ensure good to soft or softer. The new clerk at Aintree, Sulekha Varma, tells me it would probably have been good to soft this week, though some watering might have been necessary.With that in mind, I’m going to have a crack at working out what would have happened in this year’s Grand National, had it taken place this weekend. I’ll post my ‘result’ at 3pm on here and explain how it panned out. In the meantime, please tell me through the comments below what you reckon wouldshould have happened in the great race and maybe I’ll let that influence me. Would Tiger Roll have won for a third straight year or has the handicapper set him too great a task this time?Of course, I do a tipping piece here before the National each year and have not met with unqualified success so far. It’ll be different this time, with no pesky horses to prove me wrong the next day. See you back here at 3pm for the unravelling of the great Grand National mystery of 2020…"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff69e0bbbb30b8208e5cf600194108ad3e615ae/0_233_4339_2603/master/4339..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953d8ce38488de4a7e3d366609ee20d9","title":"twitter accounts deleted linked saudi arabia serbia egypt governments","story":"Accounts also linked to Honduras and Indonesia violated policy and were ‘targeted attempt to undermine the public conversation’Twitter has deleted 20,000 fake accounts linked to the governments of Serbia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Honduras and Indonesia, saying they violated company policy and were a “targeted attempt to undermine the public conversation”.Yoel Roth, the head of site integrity, said the removal of the accounts was part of the company’s ongoing “work to detect and investigate state-backed information operations”.Of the accounts removed on Thursday, 8,558 were linked to the Serbian Progressive party (SNS) of Aleksandar Vučić, the president. The accounts had posted more than 43m tweets amplifying positive news coverage of Vučić’s government and attacking his political opponents.Twitter also removed a network of 5,350 accounts linked to the Saudi monarchy operating out of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Together they had tweeted 36.5m times praising the Saudi leadership or criticising Qatar and Turkish activity in Yemen.The takedown of the accounts followed a tip from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which said that network had also generated tweets supportive of the Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar.“Prominent narratives included discrediting recent Libyan peace talks, criticizing the Syrian government, criticizing Iranian influence in Iraq, praising the Mauritanian government, and criticism of Houthi rebels in Yemen,” the observatory said in a blogpost.A separate Egyptian network of 2,541 accounts linked to the pro-government El Fagr newspaper, was also removed. Twitter said that the fake accounts had been used to “amplify messaging critical of Iran, Qatar and Turkey”.The social media company deleted more than 3,000 accounts which it said had been traced to a staffer working for the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández.“Much of the tweet behavior seems targeted at drowning out negative news about the Honduran president by promoting presidential initiatives and heavily retweeting the president and news outlets favorable to his administration,” the Stanford Internet Observatory said.Following up reporting by investigative journalists at Bellingcat, the company said it had removed 795 fake accounts promoting the Indonesian government and targeting the West Papuan independence movement.Twitter has purged networks of state-backed fake accounts since coming under criticism for being used as a vehicle for disinformation. Last month Twitter took joint action with Facebook and to disable a Moscow-linked operation aimed at inflaming racial tensions in the US, as the social media companies sought to respond to pressure to block attempted Russian interference in the 2020 presidential elections.“Transparency is fundamental to the work we do at Twitter,” a company statement said. “These behaviors are in violation of our policies and are a targeted attempt to undermine the public conversation.”Niam Yaraghi, a fellow with the Brookings Institution’s Center for Technology Innovation, said that the removal of the accounts would have a largely symbolic importance, arguing that it was very easy for well-resourced state actors to replace them.“When you look at these numbers of accounts, in terms of their quantity, they’re just a drop in the ocean,” Yaraghi said. “They’ll have some psychological impact, probably, but I’m very doubtful they will have any real tangible impact on anything important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93ff06cc4c498e39f5923f5377fd5806d35dc934/520_306_4098_2459/master/4098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c715d171255fb28d80d6dfc84dfdea4b","title":"sennheiser momentum true wireless 2 review top quality sound with anc","story":"German true wireless earbuds deliver on sound, have noise cancelling and long battery life in fairly large bodiesSennheiser’s second-generation high-end true wireless earbuds gain noise cancelling and longer battery life to do battle with Sony and Apple.The German firm’s first earbuds were some of the best-sounding available. Now Sennheiser hopes its £280 Momentum True Wireless 2 can steal the show once again.The first thing you notice is just how big the earbuds are. Despite being slightly smaller than the previous versions they are still large, shaped like a fez with the eartip projecting out of one corner. They protrude noticeably from your ear when worn.They are more comfortable than the previous versions, but still put pressure on some parts of my ears because of their size. People with larger ears will probably find them easier to position more comfortably, but there are no wings or similar to keep them secure. I didn’t need them, but some might, particularly for running.The fabric-covered case is larger than I’d like, too. It is pocketable, but only just, because it’s a bit thick, sticking out as a lump in your jeans. It is smaller than the case of Sony’s WF-1000XM3 but much larger than that of the AirPods Pro or Libratone’s Track Air+.The earbuds lasted over six hours with noise cancelling on, and longer with it turned off. The case fully charges the earbuds three times for a total of up to 28 hours of playback.The earbuds magnetically snap into place in the case to charge and store them, with a flip-top lid also held in place by a magnet. A USB-C socket on the back takes care of charging, which takes about 90 minutes via cable. A 10-minute charge provides enough for about 90 minutes of playback from empty.The Momentum True Wireless 2 support Bluetooth 5 and had a rock-solid connection to an iPhone 11 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, even in congested areas.The earbuds support the standard SBC Bluetooth audio format, as well as the improved AAC and aptX, but not Qualcomm’s aptX Low Latency, which their predecessors did. Not many devices support aptX LL, so while gamers might be put out, the majority of users won’t care. Lipsync wasn’t an issue with any video apps.Only the right earbud can be used independently, which is disappointing.The metal cap of each earbud is a touch panel for controls, supporting single, double and triple gestures, plus a tap and hold that adjusts volume by default. Each gesture can be configured to different actions on each earbud using the Smart Control app, including pauseplay, skip track, activating your phone’s voice assistant, turning on ANC or the ambient listening mode.Generally the touch panels work great, although they are further up your ear than you might expect at first because of the size of the earbuds.Music is paused when an earbud is removed, resuming when reinserted.Expensive, high-end earbuds like these need to deliver on sound quality. The Momentum True Wireless 2 are some of the best-sounding true wireless earbuds you can buy.They have a very clean and detailed sound, with excellent separation of instruments and tones. Mids and treble are rich and detailed and there’s plenty of punch in the low end without it being overbearing, with well-controlled highs.They sound great with practically every genre. Feed them something like Dr Dre’s The Next Episode and you’re treated to a track full of attack and aggression, while Darude’s classic Sandstorm is full of high energy and precision. They kept up with The Who’s cluttered Baba O’Riley, while orchestral pieces were delivered with the authority and depth required.If I was to nitpick, I’d say they were a bit too clean for a raw and full-blooded rendition of Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit, and lacked a bit of warmth in Ella Fitzgerald’s version of Summertime.Overall they sound great, delivering sparkling audio and revealing new things in well-worn tracks, second only to Sony’s WF-1000XM3.The earbuds also have active noise cancelling, which on top of the good noise isolation of the silicone eartips helps to reduce background drone significantly. They dealt with engine noise and the drones of fans in an office well, which means they should help on a plane, but struggled with more complex disruptions such as typing, chatting, road noise and similar.They were not as effective as Sony’s WF-1000XM3 or Apple’s AirPods Pro, being similar in level to Libratone Track Air+ but with better passive isolation.The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 are a great set of high-end true wireless earbuds that tick most boxes.They sound fantastic, particularly if you are a fan of clean, controlled and highly detailed sound. They last a long time between charges, have a solid set of gesture controls including volume adjustment, and have rock-solid Bluetooth connectivity with support for SBC, AAC and aptX.The earbuds also have excellent passive noise isolation and good but not class-leading noise cancelling. The case is good, but a little too big to comfortably pocket.The two biggest issues are their larger size, which makes them difficult to position comfortably for smaller ears, and their high cost, which is greater than their chief rivals from Sony and Apple.But if great sound is the most important thing to you, then the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 should come very close to topping your list.Pros: great sound, long battery life, ANC, AAC and aptX, strong and stable Bluetooth connection, medium-sized case has USB-C.Cons: earbuds are fairly large and can be uncomfortable for those with smaller ears, case a bit thick, expensive, left earbud cannot be used on its own.

From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3b78f8faecfa509c17c1f61ab0464d39bdb49a/0_239_5030_3020/master/5030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8b7aecb09fb1e4af3ee91a1ef68d5c6","title":"send tip favourite travel souvenir win 200 pounds sawdays stay","story":"Tell us about something you picked up on your travels that brings back great memories or takes you back in timeGiven that we’re all stuck at home for who knows how long, our travel memories are especially poignant.

She overheard a stray remark at her local police station, followed it up and published a report in the local paper – which she had started as a family newsletter and had grown into a YouTube channel and print publication with subscription membership.Home Before Dark takes things a stage further by having Hilde (Brooklynn Prince, who first came to prominence with a critically acclaimed starring role at the age of seven in Sean Baker’s film The Florida Project) become embroiled in actually investigating a murder that takes place in Erie Harbour. It is her father’s home town, where they have returned after he lost his job as an investigative journalist in Brooklyn.The victim is the sister of a man convicted of abducting a boy called Ritchie back in her father’s day, and whose body has never been found. Hilde is obsessed with All the President’s Men (which she’s watched 36 times) and precociously interested in the first amendment, reporting, the pursuit of truth, justice and the American way. If that wasn’t enough, she is also gifted with semi-ine abilities to see into the human heart, discern true motives and rise above the petty squabbles of humanity to keep her eyes on more precious prizes.“Why are you deflecting?” she asks when people try to evade her persistent questioning. “It’s OK, Dad,” she says, nobly swallowing her tears and stiffening her upper lip after her father snaps at her, “I know you didn’t mean it.” There’s intellectually precocious, sure, and there’s emotional maturity. And then there are moments beyond the capacity of most human adults, never mind nine-year-olds.Hilde also appears to have a photographic memory and, whenever the plot requires it, an uncanny capacity for intuiting who suspects are and where they might have hidden vital evidence (that she then does not even briefly consider handing to the police). Oh, and she’s a (sometimes pink pussy-hat wearing) feminist. “I’m not just going to make nice!” she assures AN Adult representative of the patriarchal forces bent on inculcating outmoded feminine ideals in her.Her parents are as awed by her as the makers want viewers to be. Her father gapes at her compassion, her fearlessness and her dauntless, unjaded pursuit of what is right. Her mother goes to bat for her in the principal’s office when the school objects to her reporting on the murder. “She has a passion in life!” cries Ma. “Work that she loves more than anything else. I never had that. If a boy did what she did he’d be class president … I’m going to make sure nobody crushes her dreams!”You will have noticed by now that script rewriting is evidently one skill that does not, alas, figure among Hilde’s multitudinous talents.If the uncritical idolisation of Hilde is not offputting enough, there is also the dual-stranded plot that gives you the feeling of being in two not-great programmes at once. If it were just Hilde, Juvenile Reporter on her gumshoe adventures, it might just about function as a passable teatime show (as they used to be able to be called) – a sort of Veronica Mars for a younger demographic. But the apparent involvement of her father with missing child cases past and present mean his scenes appear plucked from a darker, more grown-up show.What saves it from simple tedious schmaltz (notwithstanding the clambering-on-tabletops-in-solidarity scene in the cafeteria as Hilde reads out – so fearlessly! So maturely! So driven-by-the-truthly! – the online comments from under her murder report) is Prince’s performance. She is simply astonishing. You wouldn’t believe her character in any other hands. Prince rises above the premise, the script, everything. She gives it her all and it is a mighty thing. It feels like a privilege to be there to witness the unfurling of such a vigorous talent. If she turns out to be able to write scripts too, that would be great."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc4c5406294b515b192548a2bec3043aff2b98b6/1714_313_2174_1304/master/2174..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5f2d2d2d0eb5af669cb078faaf8b544","title":"tiger king joe exotic netflix tv","story":"The phenomenally successful docuseries about tigers, criminals and polygamy has led to memes, celebrity fans and a newly awakened legal caseIn the century since March began, one series has emerged as the go-to distraction for the millions now sequestered in their living rooms: Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness. The bizarre documentary series on a feud between big cat owners, as well as about 95 other things, has been the No 1 program on Netflix’s US platform since it premiered less than two weeks ago. And though the news and social media remain dominated by coronavirus coverage, the five hours of drama between outlandish characters in the disturbing American trade of private zoos has proved to be strange and fittingly unhinged counter-programming. Everywhere (online) you look: if it’s not about the pandemic, it’s probably Tiger King.It was perhaps inevitable that Tiger King would blow up: it’s the tried-and-true Netflix genre of shock documentary and follows in the footsteps of such buzzy hits on strange or fascinating corners of America as Wild, Wild Country Cheer and Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened (whose director, Chris Smith, served as an executive producer on Tiger King). But Tiger King, a five-year odyssey into what is largely public information, is not only a hit but a quarantine smash – the cultural text most synonymous, timing- and crazy-level-wise, with the looking glass of America in lockdown a ridiculous, darkly alluring universe that, from the characters to celebrity fans to Americans desperate to talk about anything else, keeps on going.It helped Tiger King’s reach, of course, that the show dropped right as many American states mandated social distancing measures, isolating millions at home in dire need of distraction. And few shows can counterweight a once-in-a-generation public health crisis quite like Tiger King, which is, to be clear, truly bananas. Tiger King is the Long Island iced tea of shows, if it was stirred with Tide Pods and spiked with moonshine. It jams your processing functions by throwing a semi-truck’s worth of base interests at the wall, such as: actual tigers, polygamy, guns, genital piercings, a murder-for-hire plot, bad country music videos, a shock presidential campaign with branded condoms and meth. It’s so crazy that a convicted drug trafficker from Florida who is allegedly the inspiration for Al Pacino’s Scarface is the least remarkable person on the show. Which boils down to one intoxicating fact: for many, the horror of coronavirus is temporarily drowned out by Tiger King’s MadLibs of peak American things – Joe finds his presidential campaign manager in the ammo section of Walmart.The exposure of a Netflix show has, naturally, launched a cascade of news developments, another chapter unfolding in real time. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) denounced the series for not delving deep enough into the abuse of big cats in photo-ops and entertainment, and on Wednesday, a private zoo in Florida which had received tiger cubs from Joe was shut down by authorities. Many of the main participants have weighed into the public commentary, feeding into another round of competing narratives. Though he is in prison in Texas, Joe somehow continues to post on his Facebook page (he wants Brad Pitt to play him in the miniseries). Both Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, who called the series “sensationalized entertainment”, and Joe’s ex-business partner Jeff Lowe have disputed their portrayals, as has Baskin, who claimed she was misled in a blogpost. Tiger King co-directors Rebecca Chaiklin and Eric Goode have refuted Baskin specifically, and Goode told the New York Times: “We tried very hard to be honest and fair with all of the subjects in the story.”Meanwhile, homebound viewers have dug into the dense Tiger King filmography, unearthing video of Joe saying a racial slur (if you’ve seen any of his obscene YouTube clips this is … not surprising) or photos of Antle lurking behind Britney Spears on the night of her snake-dance performance of I’m A Slave 4 U in 2001 (“nothing will ever be more important than this,” the actor Zoe Kravitz wrote on Instagram of the find). And because truly, there is no end to content, Tiger King cast members, including Lowe, are now selling personalized fan messages via the app Cameo for between $50 to $108.That entertainment, really, is the heart of Tiger King’s maddening yet predictable appeal. In this five-alarm fire time, the desire for something to tap the pressure valve is high. And when so many are isolated and anxious, brains fried and scared, a show up to the WTF-levels of the moment is a welcome point of communion. It’s yet unclear if there will be an official Tiger King follow-up – “At the moment I’m not contemplating doing more on this at all. Let’s see what happens. We’re just taking a deep breath,” Goode told the Times. And it’s still unknown when life will go back to normal, if loved ones will be OK, how jobs and livelihoods will sustain. But there is one small certainty, at least for the moment: if you step into the Tiger King universe, you’re not alone, for the content train barrels on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6d559dec5f4c87e943a26e5e4146a3c09398e33/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=974a41cfc1a1ee3cd506752914c54858","title":"katie fahey slay the dragon gerrymandering","story":"She ended gerrymandering in Michigan against all odds. Now, as the documentary Slay the Dragon arrives, Katie Fahey’s hoping the momentum is replicated in other statesFor many years Michigan was ided evenly along party lines – a checkerboard of red and blue every election. Then, in 2011, Michigan’s Republican party legally rigged the system. Charged with drawing new district lines, the lawmakers did so with unprecedented precision – carving unnatural boundaries to keep their favored voters and locales in hand – to guarantee a majority for their party.It worked perfectly. The process of creating these doctored maps, known as gerrymandering, resulted in widespread victories for the Republicans. The party controlled almost every level of government, from the state supreme court to municipal workers. And with tangible impact on Michigan’s people: the Flint water crisis, which killed 12 people, happened because party legislators appointed emergency managers whom voters opposed.But in 2016, a then 26-year-old with no political experience uprooted the system.Katie Fahey hates politics. She can’t stand cable news punditry. She has little confidence in any of the 2020 presidential candidates. And she refuses to identify with a political party. But she dedicated two years of her life to launching and leading a grassroots campaign that started with a Facebook post and, against the odds, ended gerrymandering in Michigan.“Part of the problem we have right now is everybody’s looking for a savior, whether it’s an inidual politician or a political party,” Fahey said. “We as a whole aren’t working as hard to make sure that our voice is staying at the table and that we are watching what’s being done.”In hindsight, it’s easy to see why thousands flocked to her passionate message in Michigan – and why film-makers found Fahey the perfect anchor for their gerrymandering documentary Slay the Dragon, named for the oddly shaped district in Massachusetts created by the man who gerrymandering its name, former vice-president Elbridge Gerry. The film arrives on demand on 3 April.But for Fahey, being a young woman and a political outsider meant she faced an uphill battle to reform the redistricting process every step of the way.Fahey’s political frustration reached a boiling point after the 2016 presidential election. She had flown from Michigan to New York in a red pantsuit on 8 November, expecting to celebrate the first female president at Hillary Clinton campaign’s watch party. Instead, she was left stunned by Donald Trump’s victory. And she dreaded spending Thanksgiving with her extended, politically ided family in their home town just outside Grand Rapids.Born Katie Rogala, her family mostly steered clear of politics during her childhood in Caledonia, Michigan (population: 1,527), though her dad’s veteran status meant patriotism surrounded them. Fahey considered herself an independent, and worked at a recycling coalition after college, doing improvisational comedy – even starting an improv festival from scratch. (She married her improv co-star Sean Fahey in 2013, but the pair recently orced.)That year, eager to find a unifying topic to focus on over turkey and stuffing, Fahey turned her attention to gerrymandering. “I didn’t want to talk about who we voted for because that was always leading back to literally people being like, ‘You’re evil for thinking that way,’” Fahey said. “So I thought, man, I wonder if systemic reform, getting back to one person, one vote would be something that appeals to everybody.”While the practice of politicians redrawing district lines in their favor dates to the early 1800s in Massachusetts, recent technology has taken gerrymandering in America to the extreme. Now, following each decennial census count, it’s legal for state politicians to hire mapmakers to use software that precisely manipulates bizarrely squiggled districts – resembling everything from a praying mantis to Goofy kicking Donald Duck – to cram their opponents into a limited area or otherwise guarantee votes.Michigan is one of the most gerrymandered states in the US. Leaked emails have even revealed a Republican aide boasted about packing “Dem garbage” into select districts during the 2011 GOP legislative redrawing.On 11 November 2016, Fahey posted a Facebook status: “I’d like to take on gerrymandering in Michigan, if you’re interested in doing this as well, please let me know :).” Within hours, she’d created a new Facebook group and soon, the non-partisan Voters Not Politicians (VNP) was born. Fahey was the face of a movement. Well, almost.For the next few months, Fahey never met her supporters. They strategized and bonded online, something Fahey said helped build her confidence because “it’s easier to be vulnerable behind a screen”. But by March 2017, she and her fellow volunteers were ready to hold meetings across the state asking residents how they would like to see a new redistricting system work.It’s in those meetings that Fahey’s improv experience came in handy. She had an ease onstage, and in front of crowds – rumors even circulated that she was a paid actor, a plant supplied by the Democrats and that her whole Facebook-origin story was an elaborate hoax. “A lot of people were more skeptical and more dismissive of us being able to be the ‘real deal’ because of my age and gender,” she said.Voters Not Politicians’ final proposal emerged after 33 days: take the power out of the politicians’ hands, starting with the 2021 redistricting, by creating a 13-person citizens’ committee, composed of four Republicans, four Democrats and five unaffiliated people.But that was just the beginning. To get it on the ballot as a proposed constitutional amendment in the November 2018 midterm election, they would need 315,000 signatures in the next 180 days and, with limited funds and virtually no experience, they were starting at a huge disadvantage. “Normally, before you’d announce, you’d have your constitutional language written and you would have raised millions of dollars,” Fahey says. “Literally, we had just opened our bank account the day before because we couldn’t figure out how.”An undeterred and perpetually smiling Fahey led 4,000 volunteers, many of whom had also never been politically active, to contribute their skills, down to the woodcarver who helped make their clipboards. Jennifer Lawrence and Arnold Schwarzenegger chimed in with support. Even Republican voters and legislators were eager to sign and “the only people who would ever say no were usually people who were involved in the redistricting process before or somehow really, really involved in partisan politics”.“Without Katie, I believe, we would not have been successful,” said Hal Gurian, a Republican from Traverse City who volunteered for the campaign. “She was a hands-on leader who worked diligently with as many volunteers as she had time to meet personally or talk with on the phone.”“People don’t realize their own power. A lot of people, especially women, in the campaign, were so reluctant to go into leadership positions,” Fahey says, noting that after the campaign ended “we had, like, 17 people who ended up running for local office”.Next year, Michigan’s district lines will be redrawn by voters, not politicians for the first time.Slay the Dragon will be released this week during a census year – when the US population will be carefully counted in order to determine the size of electoral districts next year.It’s clear that Fahey’s hard-won movement is a threat to Republicans across the country during that process. Michigan’s Republican party and activists continue to try and block the change with multiple lawsuits, claiming it is unconstitutional and discriminatory.But Fahey is hoping the momentum from VNP can be replicated in the 35 other states that still use congressional redistricting. She self-identifies as a “democracy entrepreneur”. (That label worn by anyone else could seem insufferable, but on Fahey, who radiates an infectious earnestness, it works.) And she founded a national not-for-profit last year called the People, which hopes to create Katie 2.0s across the country by giving frustrated citizens the tools to tackle systemic issues they care about, such as the partisan primary process and election security.To be successful, those initiatives might need people like Katie at the forefront. “She is an inspiring, motivating and tireless leader,” Gurian said.While the impact of her work can’t be measured quite yet, the ripple effects are clear. In early March, the Democrat-majority Virginia senate voted to relinquish their power in favor of a committee. Groups in Nebraska, Oregon, Arkansas and Oklahoma are currently pushing for reform.Meanwhile Fahey keeps a surprisingly low profile from her home in Grand Rapids, which she shares with three rescue dogs. Though her platform started with a Facebook post, she has no public Instagram and a modest Twitter presence. Even the fact that she’s the face of Slay the Dragon doesn’t sit well with her. And don’t expect her to run for office anytime soon. “I’d be more excited about governing than I would about running or feeling like I have to follow the party line because that’s just not me,” she said.For now, she spends what little free time she has taking her dogs to the park or escaping from “real-world problems” with video games. Role-playing fantasies are her favorite, including, of course, Dragon Quest.“I think what I like about them is – this is so dumb – you have these different characters who all play their role and even if there is a main character, your team is only stronger because everybody’s bringing their strengths to the table,” she says.“That is just so how I live my life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32b8a510a84ee6edb5c03f30110e293008834239/0_0_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e532867b713a9cd57f614139c1d310e2","title":"navajo nation grassroots self help coronavirus","story":"Women are leading a volunteer effort to care for elders and vulnerable people across the tribe’s vast, poorly served territoryIn mid-March, shortly after the Navajo Nation declared a public health state of emergency, Ethel Branch went out to stock up on supplies for her elderly mother and nieces who live on the Native American reservation.Branch, who lives in Flagstaff, Arizona, spent all day going from store to store trying to find canned soups, soap and toilet paper. Many had sold out, while others were price gouging amid rising panic about the coronavirus pandemic.Branch started calling friends looking for ideas about how to ensure the tribe’s most vulnerable families got enough food, water and hygiene supplies without risking their lives by traveling long distances.With these harsh realities in mind, Branch and her friends created the Navajo \u0026amp Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund, and started a GoFundMe page.By Thursday, $267,000 had been donated and a small army of volunteers was coordinating a full-scale emergency response to distribute crucial supplies to needy families across the vast Navajo territory and the neighboring Hopi reservation, where three small convenience stores serve almost 3,000 people.So far, more than 2,000 households have registered for help – some online but most by calling a call center volunteer who asks them about how much food they have left, allergies and medical needs, in order to prioritize orders.Hundreds of care packages – containing core items such as flour, beans, rice, canned soups, dried meat, fever and cough medicine, as well as fresh vegetables, fruit and meat when available, have been delivered to elders caring for grandchildren and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Fifty went to Chilchinbeto, a close-knit community of 500 people which has been locked down since the first localized spread was detected.The volunteer effort is an example of what the Navajo call T’áá hwó ajít’éego, or self-reliance and self-determination.“There’s no fixed model, we do what needs to be done, to get supplies where they are needed as fast and safely as possible through our network,” Branch told the .The volunteer – and government – efforts are a mammoth task given the size and geography of the Nation which stretches 27,000 square miles over the south-western Colorado plateau across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The territory, which is roughly the size of West Virginia, includes arid deserts and alpine forests with high plateaus, mesas and mountains reaching over 10,000ft in altitude.In addition to economic and topographic challenges, the coronavirus pandemic represents particular risks to the Navajo – and other tribal nations – as rates of cancer, heart and respiratory diseases and diabetes are comparatively higher than in the non-Native populations, while tribal health services have been underfunded for decades.Amid growing concern, the Navajo government issued a shelter-in-place order on 21 March – two days after California – shutting down all non-essential government services and businesses.“The order is to make sure we flatten the curve as soon as possible, and that means getting supplies to our most vulnerable residents and shelters so people stay home, and stay safe,” said tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty. “Water is now our number one priority.”The limited access to clean, running water made following coronavirus prevention guidelines such as frequent hand-washing challenging. Now, many government water distribution points have closed, while others have cut their hours to comply with the stay-at-home order.Finding a reliable bulk water supplier is a priority for Branch’s group as local stores and distributors expect shortages over coming weeks.The Navajo women driving this grassroots relief effort bring a range of business, public service and organizing experience, and include the owner of a home care company, a director of a not-for-profit small business incubator, and head of the department of corrections.These skills and contacts enabled them to make deals with wholesalers, and set up distribution points where volunteers sanitize items before trucking them to households in far-flung communities like Tuba City, Black Mesa and Hopi. The baskets are left on the doorstep, to minimize unnecessary physical contact.So far, 214 Covid-19 cases including seven deaths had been confirmed on the Nation.“It warms the heart,” said longstanding tribal council delegate Daniel Tso. “It brings tears to my eyes to see people organizing and risking their own health to protect the elderly and vulnerable children, it really shows the strength of the Navajo people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e10b483fd192bd2bc1d64745e2bfe94539c427/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ae645d059d59ae6b74dcc99c3b24053","title":"us navy uss theodore roosevelt coronavirus","story":"Captain Brett Crozier relieved of his command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt after letter he wrote appealing for help was leakedThe US navy has dismissed the commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, who had raised the alarm about an outbreak of coronavirus on his ship.Thomas Modly, the acting secretary of the navy, said that Captain Brett Crozier had been relieved of his command of the nuclear-powered carrier because he had copied in too many people on an internal memo on Monday, in which he urgently appealed for members of his crew who had fallen ill to be allowed to disembark for medical care in Guam.By Thursday, 114 of the more than 4,000 crew had tested positive for Covid-19. Modly did not accuse Crozier of leaking the memo, but suggested he made it more likely that the letter would be leaked. He also accused Crozier of raising unnecessary alarm among the sailors’ families, and exaggerating the threat to their lives.“We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,” Crozier wrote in his four-page 30 March memo to senior officers, which was reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. “If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset – our sailors.”Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the Trump administration’s decision to remove the commander showed “poor judgement”.In his letter, Crozier said it was impossible to achieve social distancing and quarantine conditions on board the Roosevelt, and therefore the majority of the sailors on board should be disembarked for quarantine and treatment.Briefing the press on his decision on Thursday, Modly said accused Crozier of “not being careful” about who would receive his note.“It was copied to 20 or 30 other people. That’s just not acceptable. He did not take care and what that did is it created a little bit of a panic on the ship,” Modly said. He stressed that he was not accusing Crozier of leaking the memo himself.Modly said that the navy had already begun mobilizing resources to help the crew in response to Crozier’s earlier requests for assistance.“He was fully aware of the navy’s response, only asking that he wished the crew could be evacuated faster,” the acting secretary said. He pointed out that so far, none of the infected crew was so ill to need hospitalization, and contrasted that with Crozier’s warning that sailors could die.“No one knows that to be true. It does not comport with the data we have right now on the ship,” Modly said.He argued he was forced to act “when I have a commanding officer who’s responsible for a nuclear powered aircraft carrier, with all that lethality and all that responsibility, who exercises that poor judgment in a situation in a crisis like this.”Modly and other officials had initially said that Crozier was right to air his concerns. On Thursday the acting secretary denied he had been under pressure from the White House to fire the commander.The Democratic leadership of the House armed services committee issued a statement saying that Crozier had not behaved “appropriately” but argued the dismissal was “an overreaction”.“It is a destabilizing move that will likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardize our fleet’s readiness,” the statement read."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d7bcd1024d2622ecec5c8b9478d449aef15e777/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b43bc4a4db47b06bb71fb7b286eff2f4","title":"clinicians revised ppe guidance inadequate supplies","story":"Updated advice says any healthcare worker coming within two metres of suspected case should wear protective equipmentClinicians given the right to demand higher-specification personal protective equipment when dealing with coronavirus have warned that new guidance could count for little unless new supplies are made available. New guidance, issued by the UK government, public health authorities and NHS England after criticism of previous guidelines, states that any clinician working in a hospital, primary care or community care setting within two metres of a suspected or confirmed coronavirus Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, surgical mask and eye protection “based on the risk”.It was updated after fears that the existing rules were confusing and some healthcare professionals were not being adequately protected from the risk of contracting the virus and passing it on to others.Employers and unions broadly welcomed the new guidance, issued on Thursday, which doubles the distance at which PPE is required, but warned that it must be backed by adequate supplies.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of council at the British Medical Association (BMA), said the doctors’ union had heard concerns from physicians in more than 30 hospital trusts about shortages. “What fundamentally matters is that doctors and healthcare workers get the adequate and appropriate supplies of PPE on the frontline,” he said. “Without these supplies, there is continued unacceptable danger to the health and lives of healthcare workers and their patients.”Doctors’ Association UK agreed that adequate supplies were key and said the requirement for long-sleeve protective gowns should have been extended in place of “flimsy plastic aprons”.Reports have been rife of shortages and large variations in the level of PPE available. Pictures of healthcare workers who have created their own makeshift protective equipment out of bin bags and other materials have proved embarrassing for the government and NHS leaders. Staff have also improvised masks out of snorkels, bought kit from hardware stores, and used school science goggles to protect themselves.Last week, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, Prof Derek Alderson, urged members not to risk their health, following widespread reports of shortages. He said the new guidance was an improvement, but so long as shortages remained, “my warning still holds true”.Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the guidance was straightforward for “staff to apply it to the clinical reality they face, whether they work in hospitals or the community. It means that if they think they need protective kit in a particular situation, they should be able to access it and wear it. But guidance is not the whole answer. Staff will need the right training and the right equipment, including for example ‘fit test’ kits to make sure the masks are effective. “There have been real problems with distribution, we have been assured they are being addressed, and to be fair, in many places that is happening. But any remaining supply chain problems need to be dealt with without delay.”Unite, which represents 100,000 NHS staff, said increasing supplies was “a national priority”.The government said the new guidance “reflects the fact that coronavirus is now widespread in the community, meaning clinicians are more likely to see patients with the virus, some of whom may have minimal or no symptoms” and has the support of the World Health Organization (WHO).The previous guidance recommended PPE outside high-risk procedures when healthcare workers were within one metre of a patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19. The new guidelines makes them consistent with the two-metre social distancing rule.Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: “NHS England and the government are working hard to secure the supply lines in this challenging period so staff have the appropriate equipment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7549248a2306f4ee213d8e57bf198e5038535a47/0_23_4076_2445/master/4076..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96c7499d68d1727030adf13124dbd90a","title":"coronavirus testing how some countries germany south korea got ahead of the rest","story":"Germany was quick to see the threat while South Korea took an aggressive approachCountries have approached coronavirus testing in different ways, and in some places there was far earlier recognition than in the UK of the need to develop tests and kits and to have sufficient numbers stockpiled. Here is how some countries got ahead of the curve.With its experience of Sars at the start of the century and as the apparent source of origin of Covid-19, it is perhaps unsurprising that China is ahead of others on testing. By the end of March it had conducted well over 320,000 tests.One of the earliest tests was developed in mainland China by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and details of it were posted on the World Health Organization website on 24 January, just after the Wuhan lockdown was announced.A Hong Kong team that helped identify Sars worked to develop its own test. “Because we have gone through all these events in the past, we know how important it is to have a working diagnostic test,” said Leo Poon, who led the team. “That’s why we basically tried to get the work done as soon as possible.”As one of the world’s major chemicals producers, China was able to quickly accelerate production of kits.Germany’s preparedness was helped in part by a recognition that coronavirus was likely to become a global problem. While most countries were slow in dusting off pandemic preparedness plans, in early January a scientist in Berlin, Olfert Landt, recognised the similarity to Sars and realised a test kit would be needed.Lacking a gene sequence for the new coronavirus, Landt and his company designed their first test kit based on Sars and other known coronaviruses. The protocol was published by the WHO on 17 January, before the Chinese test. The British government passed on this test. By the end of February Landt had produced 4m kits and was making another 1.5m a week.As well as having an effective test in mass production, Germany signed up politically to mass testing from the beginning, resulting in it being able to do 12,000 tests daily.South Korea has been among the most aggressive when it comes to testing. In contrast with the early stages in the UK – where Boris Johnson said coronavirus was likely to “spread a bit more” – South Korean health officials quickly learned the lessons from Wuhan that the new virus was extremely contagious and could spread rapidly over a wide area.The country prioritised identifying and isolating people testing positive for the disease, and developed capacity to run about 15,000 diagnostic tests a day. It has conducted more than 300,000 tests to date, free of charge, including in drive-through testing booths since replicated elsewhere.Small and relatively wealthy, the country has a few advantages when it comes to testing, and it has tested a higher proportion of its citizens than anywhere else in the world, including many showing no symptoms of the disease.“Iceland’s population puts it in the unique position of having very high testing capabilities with help from the Icelandic medical research company deCode Genetics,” Thorolfur Guðnason, Iceland’s chief epidemiologist, told BuzzFeed. He said the testing effort was “intended to gather insight into the actual prevalence of the virus in the community, as most countries are most exclusively testing symptomatic iniduals at this time.”After Germany, Italy has done the most testing, with about 200,000 tests. These included all 3,000 residents of the town of Vò, near Venice, in a pilot project designed to see if whole-community testing could help slow the spread of the disease.Italy showed how widespread testing could be as politically contentious as insufficient testing, with some including the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, initially appearing to blame the country’s high number of infections on the policy of testing people without symptoms. “We have been the first ones with the most rigorous and accurate controls,” Conte said on TV, adding that Italy appeared to have more people infected because “we did more tests”. As it turned out, the tests were an accurate warning of what was coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69515f35b15605b8df59c84c8296b8acc7cb2846/0_85_4000_2401/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f968562bfadc9e6e0be32d49b8054bc","title":"coronavirus took hold in uk earlier than thought data reveals","story":"Earliest death occurred on 28 February, almost a week before previously acknowledgedThe coronavirus outbreak took hold earlier in the UK and has claimed dozens more lives than previously thought, new data in England and Scotland has revealed.Amid growing concern over the shifting picture of the outbreak presented by changes to the daily figures, NHS England said the earliest death occurred on 28 February, almost a week before previously acknowledged.Health trusts in England disclosed that six people had died in hospitals from Covid-19 as early as February – with the first death previously made public on5 March. The news came as the UK endured its most deadly day of the coronavirus pandemic, in which 569 fatalities were recorded.The UK-wide figures showed that by 5pm on Wednesday a total of 2,921 people had died, following a slightly larger increase than the previous day, when there were 563 deaths.By 9am on Thursday, 163,194 people had been tested for the virus across the UK, with 33,718 positive cases, representing a rise of 4,244 from the previous day. In all, 12,949 people have so far been hospitalised with symptoms.The figures for deaths reveal a moving picture, with totals beset by inconsistencies and the overall number of deaths reported on any given day significantly higher than those from the preceding 24 hours. On Thursday, 561 deaths were reported, but only 84 took place in the 24 hours to 5pm on 1 April. Earlier this week the number of deaths reported on one day was less than half the total number of deaths that occurred in the reporting period the day before. On 30 March, 159 deaths were reported by NHS England. The true number of deaths on that day has since been revised up to 401.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia specialising in infectious diseases, said the data suggested the UK was about two weeks behind Italy. “Yesterday was a huge jump on the previous day, which itself was a pretty big rise from the day before. This rise is slightly more than yesterday but essentially on par,” he said.The devolved government later released revised data for the week after using new methodology that included laboratory data. Until today, Covid-19 deaths in that set were not counted until next of kin had given permission for them to be recorded.The updated figures showed that Scottish fatality rates began increasing much more steeply than thought on 31 March. Using the old system, the official death toll stood at 86 on Thursday the new methodology put Thursday’s total at 126.Catherine Calderwood, Scotland’s chief medical officer, said every death meant there were roughly 1,000 coronavirus infections in the general population, implying that 40,000 more Scots may have been infected.Sturgeon said there had been delays in obtaining relatives’ consent before some deaths were recorded centrally. Health Protection Scotland, a government agency, confirmed later that “new, more efficient” reporting procedures had now been introduced which did not need family consent.“Part of the cruelty of this virus is that when people are in hospital and when they’re dying, family members are not able to be with them,” Sturgeon said. “Therefore it has taken a bit longer for families to be informed and for them to give their consent to all the things that are required.”Opposition parties censured the Scottish government over the misreporting. Labour said it echoed concerns from GPs and families that deaths outside hospitals and “presumed deaths” were not being properly recorded and being missed.Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour’s health spokesman, said: “Irrespective of where people have died, be it in their own house, a nursing home or a hospital, we need the full facts about this virus. It’s clear that a lack of testing is contributing to the lack of information, which is unacceptable.”Additonal reporting: Niamh McIntyre and Pamela Duncan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1984dce1e86d9d6ba2113b49e94f0e70aaec0a/0_125_2603_1562/master/2603..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb8cfeb39b7f4a38d348454a249d6af5","title":"germany told it needs to massively increase coronavirus testing","story":"Country seen as a model for its response is told it is not doing nearly enoughGermany still needs to increase its coronavirus testing rate dramatically if it wants to successfully manage the virus, scientists are advising the government.As the British government has struggled to tackle a testing shortfall, Germany has been repeatedly named as an example to follow in recent days, but a confidential scientific study commissioned by the government and recently leaked to German media showed that if it wanted to avoid a mass outbreak of the coronavirus, the country would have to greatly increase its testing capacity.Ever since the government’s introduction of a strict lockdown, including closing the country’s borders and shutting down schools and nurseries, the scientists said around a million people in Germany – which has a population of just under 83 million – were likely to become infected, and around 12,000 would die. That outlook, however, was based on an increase in testing to 100,000 a day and within weeks to 200,000 a day.The study’s authors said that in order to carry out testing in the most efficient and quickest way possible, it would also be necessary in the longer term to rely on the use of big data and location tracking via mobile phones, an issue that is controversial in Germany.Lothar Wieler, the head of the government’s main public health advisory body, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said that while German testing was high compared with other countries, it would have to be speeded up. “We need to increase efficiency,” he said, adding that he welcomed the news that the use of quicker and simpler tests, in addition to the current standard PCR – polymerase chain reaction test, which directly detects the DNA or RNA of the pathogen – would soon be available.Germany has a large network of more than 85 laboratories and a good history of detecting illness early. A nationwide network set up between doctors’ practices, normally used to monitor the flu, was also used for testing for Covid-19 from February onwards, and the fact the system only detected a case on 12 March indicates that the virus was not widespread before then..“The fact is that Germany started testing early on and has tested broadly. That way, many cases but also milder cases have been detected, and they did not generally include the elderly,” Wieler said.It has, he said, in effect distorted the figures. He warns that the situation in Germany is likely to worsen, as many more of the elderly who have so far not been so affected, are likely to get sick. “We are still at the start of the epidemic, and it is completely unclear as to how it will develop,” Wieler said. “But of course the number of deaths in Germany will rise.”He has insisted there is not, as has sometimes been suspected, an “under-reporting” of deaths from Covid-19 by hospitals. It would in theory be possible that some deaths were not counted as deaths from coronavirus, if the patient had an underlying health condition. But that is seldom likely to be the case, due to the sensibility towards the illness right now. Only if someone with coronavirus was killed by something unrelated to the virus, such as a car crash, would they not be included, medical authorities say.Testing laboratories across Germany report that while they have been at pains to increase their capacity, they face many obstacles. Germany’s federal system has contributed to an inefficient gathering of data – including an unclear picture of how much testing has been done – and delays in testing suspected cases, delivering results or informing contact people. Germany’s regional health bodies have recruited extra staff to help deal with the backlog, but say they are struggling to keep up. The RKI has recruited scouts – often medical students and trained doctors who arrived as refugees but are waiting to have their qualifications recognised – to support the system.Accredited Laboratories in Medicine (ALM), the largest association representing laboratories in Germany working on the tests, has said that testing capacity has increased significantly since the first case emerged in the country at the end of January.“We’re working around the clock, in a shift system, including at weekends,” Evangelos Kotsopoulos, head of ALM told Die Zeit newspaper. “Our main bottlenecks are staff – many of whom have young children and are affected by school and nursery closures – and supplies from industry. Around the world there are only five or six big suppliers for the materials that we need.”Kotsopoulos said Germany should be far more focused on who it tested, to ensure those “who don’t have symptoms but just want to know whether they have it or not” are not tested, in favour of those such as at-risk patients for whom it is considered a necessity. “It is simply not practically possible right now to test everyone in a population of our size,” he said.According to the RKI’s guideline, priority should be given to testing medical workers, people with underlying health conditions showing coronavirus symptoms and those in contact with those who are infected, so as to be able to place them under quarantine.But many working on the testing frontline report concerns about a lack of materials and inefficiency, as well as a shortage of staff, forcing many people to work seven-day weeks.“The reagents we need are produced by just three manufacturers in Germany and they have run dry,” Elisabeth Koerber-Kröll from the district medical faculty in Schwäbisch Hall, in Baden-Württemberg, south-west Germany, one of the hardest hit regions told broadcaster SWR.Increasing emphasis is also being put on antibody tests, as well as antigen tests, as a more efficient way of managing the spread of the virus, in addition to self-testing, although many are sceptical that that this is reliable enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e40051d6a4a0260f2ecf2c20e0bd20f7868899/0_100_5481_3288/master/5481..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4be864d580943fafeb3d9b2e0b657e","title":"words i thought id never write thank god for matt hancock","story":"The health secretary wrote off £13bn of NHS debt, promised 100,000 tests and acted like a grownupFor much of the week, it’s been as if the government has gone out of its way to appear wilfully clueless. First, the psychotically unstable Dominic Raab, then the pathologically untrustworthy Michael Gove, culminating with the shambolically underprepared Alok Sharma. History repeating itself first as tragedy, then as farce. It was as if the only real contingency plans the government had made were for the postponement of this year’s climate change conference. Sometimes, doing absolutely nothing proves to be entirely the right option.But cometh the hour … There are some words I thought I’d never write. Like “Thank God for Matt Hancock”. But thank God for Matt Hancock. It seemed a high-risk strategy to send out the health secretary for the daily Downing Street press conference as it was only six days since he announced that he had contracted coronavirus. And the official NHS guidance is for anyone with symptoms to self-isolate for a week.Maybe he had first become symptomatic shortly after 5pm last Thursday. That at least would explain why the press conference began 25 minutes late. Matt was merely doing his civic duty. He had been waiting the full seven days and had sneaked into Downing Street under the wire.This was Hancock at his least needy. Though, Matt being Matt, he couldn’t not let slip a slight air of Tiggerishness at the start of his statement. A Tigger’s gotta do what a Tigger’s gotta do. The government had been doing a brilliant job. Everything that was being done was being guided by the science: even if the science the UK government had occasionally seemed out of step with that of countries with rather better track records on treating the disease.He was also positively gushing about the speed at which the 4,000-bed Nightingale hospital had been knocked together in London. In fairness, it’s one hell of an achievement. But by no stretch of the imagination can it be called a proper hospital. It’s a field hospital at best. Let’s hope Boris Johnson doesn’t think he can get away with counting it as one of his promised 40 new hospitals. When push comes to shove, it’s just a much-needed large facility providing basic care for people with respiratory problems. It would be no one’s destination of choice for urgent treatment.But then Tigger dropped the Tigger act. Rishi Sunak apart, for the first time since the pandemic started, a minister stood up to take responsibility for the situation. It’s a weird coincidence that the two ministers who look as if they still need to show ID at off-licences are the ones to show true leadership. Sure, he looked a bit defensive at times, but given the circumstances, that seemed fair enough. He was boldly going where no minister had gone before.Even though he didn’t go into details – such as why the South Koreans and the Germans are able to identify tests that work while we appear to have bought 7.5m kits that we still don’t know are effective or not – he did admit the government had made mistakes. And now that he was recovering from the illness, he was going to take personal responsibility for putting things right.First, he was going to write off £13bn of NHS debt. On any other day this would have been the biggest news story – one that would have horrified most of his fellow Tory MPs – but now it was nothing more than a throwaway. An academic footnote. He quickly moved on. “I have a five-pillar plan,” he declared. Politicians love to have plans in fives. Four sounds too few and six sounds as if you aren’t thinking clearly. Matt, though, had just one pillar. To fend off ongoing criticism of the government’s testing programme by committing to 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month.Given that the government has consistently missed even its own piss-poor targets – we’re struggling to manage 10,000 tests a day at the moment – it was understandable that most of the questions were on whether 100,000 was hopelessly optimistic. But Matt was adamant. He couldn’t exactly promise how many of the tests would be antibody and and how many antigen, but 100,000 was the hill he was prepared to die on. No more bullshit. No more obfuscation. A real target with his job on the line if he failed to deliver.To add to the distinct air of the surreal – it’s so rare to find a politician behaving like a grownup – he even allowed journalists follow-up questions. Normally, the minister fails to answer the question and swiftly moves on to the next one. But now Matt was positively inviting interrogation. Had he been clear enough? Do you want more details? Most of the hacks were so startled by this new openness, they didn’t actually have any prepared follow-ups and ad-libbed. For once it was the media doing the waffling.For reasons best known to itself, the BBC got bored with such an informative press conference and cut to the weather forecast halfway through. Apparently it’s going to be a nice weekend to stay indoors. But Sky persevered to the end and Matt extended the press conference to a record-beating 80 minutes. In more ways than one, he had raised the bar considerably for other ministers in the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ab6286ea156e0341b74c575303fa4d0d6af2083/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62a62c0f41e4ae31c2aedb2fb2e4d655","title":"commuted sentence covid 19 spares the japanese salaryman from ritual exhaustion","story":"Pandemic forces even the most conservative companies to rethink their practices and let employees work from homeUntil a few weeks ago Tsutomu Okada never imagined he would be working within earshot of his wife and daughter or talking to colleagues via his laptop.But in Japan, as in other parts of the world, the coronavirus pandemic has forced even the most conservative companies to rethink the way they do business in a country that has been reluctant to embrace the idea of working from home.“I used to commute for an hour in either direction, so I’m glad I don’t have to do that for the time being,” Okada, who is in his late 40s, told the . “And holding meetings online hasn’t been a problem.”Okada, an employee of a major company in Tokyo, started working from home two days a week from late February, but has been working remotely full-time since the end of March, amid a sharp rise in reported Covid-19 infections in the capital.Ironically his firm, which employs more than 40,000 people, had already made plans for staff to work from home several times a month to ease congestion during the Tokyo Olympics, now postponed for a year due to the outbreak.The pandemic has forced companies to implement changes the government has been encouraging for several years, in the hope that less demanding office hours would enable more women to return to work after giving birth and men to be more involved in housework and childcare.Resistance to working from home stems from a corporate culture that values employees being present in the workplace, often for punishingly long hours, to demonstrate their loyalty.“The Japanese still have this image that telework isn’t real work, because you’re not physically in the office,” said Haruka Kazama, an economist at the Mizuho research institute.While Japan has so far avoided the large number of infections and deaths seen in the US, Europe and China, the outbreak is challenging the traditional image of besuited, exhausted salaryman falling asleep on packed commuter trains following after-hours drinks with colleagues.“The situation has put companies’ backs against the wall,” Kazama said. “They’ve been forced to give their employees the choice to telework.”Hitachi has introduced teleworking for 50,000 employees of its group companies in Tokyo, while the advertising agency Dentsu closed its Tokyo headquarters and ordered its 5,000 staff to work from home after an employee tested positive for the virus. Daiwa Securities, with about 10,000 employees, introduced home-based teleworking for staff with small children.The pandemic also enabled employees to experiment with a healthier work-life balance. Yuki Sato, an employee of a start-up in Tokyo, has set up a small office at the home he shares with his wife and two children. Teleworking means he no longer has to endure a long commute and has more time for his daughters, whose schools are closed due to the outbreak.“I can also give them their bath in the evening, something I could never do before because I was never home before 8pm,” Sato, who has been working from home since February, told Agence France-Presse. “This experience has completely changed my image of teleworking.”Teleworking has sparked a boost in sales of items such as web cameras and headphones, but some old analogue habits die hard. In an age of electronic contracts, many Japanese companies still require employees to print out documents that are then stamped with official hanko seals, often by several people.Mariko Kitano, who works for a TV production company, believes the last few weeks have proved that more flexible working practices should continue long after the coronavirus crisis has subsided.There are times, though, when teleworking is no substitute for face-to-face contact, Kitano added. “I’m mentoring junior colleagues and it’s sometimes frustrating not to be able to see what they’re doing and offer advice in person.“But I don’t think we can go back to the way things were, despite the traditional view in Japan that you can only prove your worth by working hard in front of your boss. The past few weeks have proved that teleworking has too many advantages to be ditched.”*Okada and Kitano’s names have been changed at their request."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance friday","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Spain’s coronavirus death toll rose to a total of 10,935 from 10,003 the previous day, the country’s health ministry said on Friday, but showed the first fall in the daily death rate since 26 March.

As lockdowns continue in countries around the world, scientific advances continue to be made, even as new stumbling blocks appear.A crucial biological mechanism by which the coronavirus infects humans has been unpicked.On Monday scientists at the University of Minnesota revealed that they have examined in detail the structure of the coronavirus, in particular the spikes on its surface that help it attach to human cells. The results show that the interaction between these spikes and their corresponding receptors on human cells is about four times stronger than was the case for Sars – another coronavirus. That means that when it comes to infection, a little of the new coronavirus goes a long way.Experts say the findings have opened up the possibility of a new target for treatments for Covid-19.The promise of ramped-up testing in the UK has hit a sticking pointAt present Germany is carrying out about 70,000 PCR tests a day – these tests detect genetic material from the virus to reveal who has the infection – and has been held up as an example of good practice – though there is pressure there to do even more.In Britain, however, progress has been slow and anger is growing. On Wednesday it emerged that just 2,000 out of half a million frontline NHS staff had been tested for the virus.Setting out a new five-point plan to boost testing on Thursday, UK health secretary Matt Hancock revealed that PCR testing is expanding in hospitals and other testing facilities, with patients and NHS staff the top priority. Overall he is aiming for 100,000 tests a day by the end of April across PCR tests and antibody tests – the latter are based on blood from a finger-prick can tell who has had the diseaseTo help with this, commercial laboratories, including universities, private businesses, are pitching in to speed up testing in what has been dubbed a “Dunkirk effort” – an approach many say should have been taken sooner.But among the problems the government is facing are shortages of chemicals needed to carry out testing, leading experts to call for rules to be relaxed in order for alternatives to be used. Another difficulty is that, as yet, the UK does not have reliable antibody tests for Covid-19.Humans may wish to include their cat in the lockdownOn Wednesday research from China revealed that infected moggies can transmit Covid-19 to other cats, with a similar situation seen between ferrets. While there is no direct evidence the disease passes from cats to humans, a report from Belgium has suggested one owner did pass Covid-19 to their feline friend.By contrast, the team in China found that dogs, chickens, pigs and ducks were unlikely to catch the infection or pass it on to their peers.Experts have advised pet owners to be particularly vigilant about handwashing. To find out more about why soap and water is so effective in tackling coronavirus tune in to the ’s Science Weekly which has a new episode on the matter, as well as other questions including how the virus may affect pregnant women and how different tests for the infection work.

The Zaandam had last stopped in South America on 14 March and had since been turned away from 11 countries. However, other cruise ships remain in limbo while carrying passengers infected with Covid-19 – among them is the Coral Princess, also hoping to dock in Florida. Cruise ships are also in purgatory off the coast of Australia, with many staying put despite being ordered to leave. This week it was announced by the NSW government that a military-style operation may be employed to test all cruise ship crew members, with anyone in need to medical attention evacuated to hospital. They hope the ships will then return to their ports of origin.  Face masks may yet become the accessory du jourSurgical face masks have generally been deemed to have little effect in protecting iniduals from catching coronavirus in general situations, not least because they are not close-fitting and tiny viral particles can penetrate – unlike well-fitting masks that have a respirator to filter air such as FFP3 models.However, surgical masks can catch droplets from coughs and sneezes, suggesting they do offer some protection, while experts say the such masks may help to reduce transmission of Covid-19 from infected people even before they show symptoms by catching droplets when people talk.This week the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association stressed that hospital staff and patients should wear surgical masks to cover their mouths and reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19.Now the World Health Organization and the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US are looking into whether wearing surgical masks in public may, after all, help in the fight to tackle the pandemic. Among the triggers for the rethink is that such masks were part of measures used Hong Kong, where containment has proved effective. Bill De Blasio, New York City Mayor, has asked all residents to wear them outside.In Italy the camaraderie of earlier weeks appears to be giving way to social unrest, with Italians no longer singing or dancing on balconies as dwindling reserves of food and money see tensions rise, particularly in poorer regions.Coronavirus continues to hammer all aspects of societySport continues to be battered by the coronavirus: this week it has emerged that sporting bodies in the UK fear they may not survive the outbreak, while financial news is also grim: the Eurozone’s manufacturing and services sectors has revealed the biggest ever single monthly fall in March.While crises can spur incredible developments in science and society, not every attempt is a success. This week a 27-year old astrophysicist in Melbourne wound up needing medical help in what may be the strangest Covid-19 related hospitalisation yet.Playing with powerful neodymium magnets while attempting to develop a necklace that buzzed when its wearer touches their face, Dr Daniel Reardon ended up getting the magnets stuck in his nose. “The doctors thought it was quite funny, making comments like ‘This is an injury due to self-isolation and boredom,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45f777ddb1a5fff8f33791b9098f319d50d023a1/0_0_5565_3340/master/5565..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e6eb21e6b250bb0de41c839873cab6","title":"coronavirus uk business activity plunges to lowest ebb since records began","story":"‘Horrid, hideous, harrowing’ – insiders struggle to describe extent of coronavirus damageBusiness activity in Britain and the eurozone has plunged to the lowest levels since the start of closely watched surveys more than two decades ago, as the coronavirus crisis triggers a deep recession and widespread job losses.The latest snapshot from the purchasing managers indices (PMI) revealed the early extent of the damage in March as countries around the world imposed lockdowns to contain the spread of the disease, triggering the sharpest decline in private sector activity since the survey records began in the late 1990s.The latest health check in Britain from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), which is closely monitored by the Treasury and the Bank of England, revealed the onset of job losses last month as the government in effect shut down large swathes of the economy.The PMI reading for manufacturing and service sector output, making up the vast majority of UK growth, crashed to 36.0 in March on a scale where anything above 50.0 separates growth from contraction. The index was below the initial “flash” estimate made in late March as more survey data came in later in the month amid the onset of lockdown measures. The collapse in the PMI, down sharply from 53.0 in February, was the worst reading since records began in 1996.Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said: “It’s increasingly difficult to find the words to describe the devastation as every region in the world fights to save human life as the first priority. The likelihood of a global recession is now a given, though its duration and severity has yet to reveal itself.”British companies said emergency government support to furlough staff had helped prevent more widespread job losses in March. However, employment in the services sector – which includes restaurants, hotels and the City – dropped at the fastest pace for more than a decade.Reflecting international travel restrictions and widespread business closures across Europe, companies said existing projects had been placed on hold and new inquires from abroad had virtually ceased.Surveys of factory output and service sector activity in eurozone also revealed the biggest ever single monthly fall in March, setting the currency bloc on course for a deep recession.The IHS Markit eurozone composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and service sector activity, plunged to 29.7, below the flash reading and significantly down on the 51.6 level recorded in February before Covid-19 struck Europe. The PMI was the worst since the eurozone survey began in 1998.“In one line: horrid, hideous, harrowing … you get the picture,” said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. “We are struggling to come up with words to describe these numbers, which are now so far out of any reasonable range that they are difficult to interpret.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area map","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Until this week China’s national health commission was not including people who tested positive but showed no symptoms in its tally. On Friday it reported 31 new confirmed cases, including two locally transmitted infections. Four people died, all of them in Wuhan.While the number of daily cases has dropped dramatically since February, Wang Zhonglin, Wuhan’s Communist party chief, said the risk of a rebound in the city’s epidemic remained high due to both internal and external risks and it must continue to maintain prevention and control measures.Wuhan has eased restrictions over recent weeks and authorities have said curbs on travel will lift on 8 April, for those with the green “health code”.China will hold national mourning on Saturday for 14 “martyrs” who died while responding to the pandemic.

Media reports said the passengers had been informed of the rules before they boarded their flights.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.The rule, which came into force on Wednesday, requires all overseas arrivals – including South Koreans – to quarantine at home or at government-designated facilities for 14 days.It is not clear if the eight deported people had been asked to self-isolate at home or were to be taken to a government-designated facility.Those making short-term visits must stay at government-designated facilities, according to the ministry of health and welfare, and are charged about 100,000 won (£65) a day throughout their quarantine. Visitors who are permitted to quarantine at home must install a smartphone app that enables authorities to track their movements in real time.The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, said people who violated the quarantine rules would be subject to “strong legal measures”.Those who skip quarantine face up to three years in prison or a maximum fine of 10m won. Foreign violators also face deportation and could be barred from re-entering the country.The authorities are considering taking legal action against a British man living in the city of Suwon, who allegedly broke self-quarantine rules after returning from a trip to Thailand last month.The man, who has since tested positive for Covid-19, visited other cities, played golf and came into contact with more than 20 people, the Suwon city council said on its website.The mayor of Suwon, Yeom Tae-young, said in a Facebook post that the city would “deal with this sternly”.South Korean media have reported similar incidents involving a Polish man who had been ordered to self-isolate after his friend tested positive, and a German student in the city of Busan who had arrived from the US via Japan.Instead of isolating himself, he reportedly visited a beach, took the subway and played basketball with friends, according to the Busan municipal government. He continued to spend time outside, even after developing a cough and a fever.The incidents have sparked anger on South Korean social media. “Why do they think they can break the rules that we have to abide by?” one user wrote. “Do they think they are above the law?”Another wrote: “The government should keep them out. After all, South Koreans are banned from entering most countries in the world now.”Immigration authorities are making no exceptions, as Nina Baeva discovered when she and her South Korean partner arrived at Incheon airport on 1 April, the day the quarantine measures went into effect.Baeva, who has requested that her real name not be used, had flown from a European country but expected to see out the 14-day quarantine at her partner’s apartment in the capital.Baeva’s partner went to his private address, while she was spending her third day at a government quarantine centre on Friday.“I couldn’t sleep last night due to the anxiety and jet lag. I am emotionally broken. I cannot find any other way to describe my status. I am crying continuously. I am almost hoping to test positive so that I can go to a hospital.”A spokesman for Korean Air said the airline and other carriers flying to South Korea were “very clear about the government’s measures, which are explained to each passenger at check-in and at the departure gate”.He added: “We would not tell anyone that they would be able to choose between staying at a private accommodation or a government facility. If someone is arriving on a short-term visa waiver, they are told that they will have to be isolated at at a government facility.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Tens of thousands of secondary school students have called for this year’s State exams to be cancelled and replaced with predicted grades.In an online survey of 47,000 Junior and Leaving Cert students over the past week, the Irish Second-Level Students’ Union found that most want their grades to be based on their coursework to date due to the disruption caused by schools being closed due to the coronavirus outbreak. At Leaving Cert level, 49 per cent of students are in favour of cancelling the June exams and using already-completed coursework to decide their final grades.Other less popular options include proceeding with written exams in June while adhering to social distancing (26 per cent) and rescheduling exams to July or August (19 per cent).At Junior Cert level, some 77 per cent of students are also in favour of cancelling the June exams and using predicted grades.Other options are much less popular, such as rescheduling exams (9 per cent)or proceeding with the June exams while adhering to social distancing (8 per cent).When the two exam years are combined, a total of 60 per cent of Junior and Leaving Cert students support cancelling exams and using a predicted grade model.Other education systems such as the UK’s A-Levels and the International Baccalaureate have cancelled exams and are using assessed or predicted grades based on students’ coursework.Teachers’ unions in Ireland, however, have traditionally been fiercely opposed to grading their own students for the purposes of the State exams.In the ISSU survey, many students who supported cancelling exams said it would best serve students’ health and wellbeing.“Going ahead with the exams would not only put students’ health at risk but also would not be fair to students having missed out on a whole semester of learning in school,” one student wrote.Another said: “We are missing time in school the past few weeks. It is harder to learn new materials for our exams in June. A predictive model would definitely take a lot more stress off students.”Many also said that while remote learning was a useful fall-back option, it was was not fair or equitable.“Nothing is as effective as a topic being fully explained to you as a teacher in a classroom environment,” wrote one student.Another added: “We’re not in a learning environment that is fair and equal for all. Not being in a school setting is detrimental to our Leaving Cert studies. The lockdown, along with the sickness and deaths of friends and family members, is widespread and affects our motivation, work ethic and wellbeing.”Students were united in their desire for “immediate clarity” from the Department of Education on what the contingency plans are for the State exams.Many said their stress levels were “going through the roof” due to uncertainty.“We need to be told what’s actually happening instead of being left hanging before anything is announced,” said one student.Another said: “The pressure we are facing is like no other exam year. The department should seriously put themselves in the students’ shoes.”On Thursday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar insisted the State exams will go ahead “by hook or by crook” and that contingency plans were being worked on.The ISSU survey was conducted online between Thursday 26th March to Wednesday April 1st 2020.The union said it will advocate on behalf of students with the Department of Education and other education stakeholders for a solution that will “alleviate the stress and uncertainty that has faced students in recent weeks” and which is as “fair as possible to all students”.It said if a predicted grade model is used, it said basing them on mock results was not sufficient and should instead be based on work and assessments completed over the course of senior cycle.The survey is based on a total of 47,000 student responses - more than a third of the 120,000 State exam students - and excludes those who are not in exam years. It includes just over 18,000 Junior Cert students and 28,000 Leaving Cert students."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4219814.1585902007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we need to cancel the leaving cert and give students predicted grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland, uniquely, seems intent on pressing ahead with State exams in some form.Along with thousands of other Leaving Cert students, I find myself in an extraordinary position. Schools are closed and look set to remain shut until the summer. Many of us do not have quiet spaces in our homes or have unreliable wifi and sub-standard laptops. Significant numbers\u0026nbspface being unable to complete the school curriculum. What impact will all this have on students studying for exams which\u0026nbspare supposed to be\u0026nbspfair and equitable?Lots of potential solutions have been floated assuming the exams do not go ahead in June. The prospect of delaying them until late summer threatens to place a huge burden on students’ shoulders and harm their mental health. Running a slimmed down version - such as English and maths - would be unfair to students whose strengths lie elsewhere. Online exams are not a viable option for students in areas where broadband is poor or non-existent.But there is a pathway to a solution - and it’s one which other countries have\u0026nbspadopted\u0026nbspwhen faced with the\u0026nbspprospect of holding national exams in the midst of an unprecedented crisis: cancel them and give students predicted grades.The American SATs, the UK’s A-levels and the International Baccalaureate are just of the education systems which have gone down this route. \u0026nbspIreland, uniquely, seems intent on pressing ahead with our exams\u0026nbspin some shape or form. On Thursday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the exams will go ahead “by hook or by crook” - despite the fact that students will have missed up to a quarter of the school year.I am fully aware that the Leaving Certificate \u0026nbspis different to exams elsewhere\u0026nbspin many ways. However, in the same way that Mr Varadkar is looking to countries such as South Korea for best pratice\u0026nbspin the State\u0027s\u0026nbspapproach to tackling the virus, this is a time to look abroad and borrow the best solutions if we are to protect students’ best interests.AbilitiesPredicted grades make sense.\u0026nbspTeachers have been testing us on topics for two years and are aware of our abilities in each subject. They are professionals and are in a position to judge our performance. It happens in many other countries - why not in Ireland?Student performance over the past two years should be used to calculate average CAO points for candidates, as is happening elsewhere. Teachers\u0027 assessments of their students could be validated against students\u0027\u0026nbsppast performance in the Junior Cert or school-wide performance.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThose who may be disgruntled with their predicted grades could, perhaps, sit exams in the autumn when re-checks usually would have occurred, giving time for them to be corrected in time for the start of college. It\u0027s not ideal, of course,\u0026nbspbut neither is giving all students 100 per cent for their cancelled oral and practical exam components.Some argue that there is no culture or precedent for teachers assessing their own students for exams in Ireland. Maybe it was once the case, but not any more. Teachers nowadays assess Junior Cycle students’ classroom-based assessments. In Leaving Cert subjects such as agricultural science, teachers grade their students’ project work which, in turn, is validated by the State Examinations Commission. In fact, every year hundreds of students who cannot complete exams for reasons outside their control are given “assessed grades” by exam authorities.\u0026nbspThese are calculated using a combination of methods, including teachers’ estimates of how\u0026nbsp students would have performed. The SEC says it takes this approach when some or all of a student’s work in not available for marking due to “unique, unforeseen and exceptional” circumstances. It\u0027s hard to think of a more apt description of the circumstances we find ourselves in.Finally, there is a large chasm emerging between schools due to a “digital ide”. Students in the most disadvantaged schools are the least likely to have access to broadband or a computer to communicate with their teachers. The opposite is true of the most privileged \u0026nbspschools. This will hinder students’ ability to do their best in the exams in very unequal ways.  Deferring the exams should\u0026nbspnot be an option. The prospect of exams being held later in summer will only add to the stress and uncertainty we are facing. It is extremely unlikely that we will return to school any time soon as Ireland has only entered into “lockdown\u0026nbspand, according to the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, Ireland is only “at an early stage” of infection. The head of the HSE has also said it is “impossible” to predict when Ireland will reach the peak of the virus. How can we ask our students to wait until the crisis abates - with no guarantee of when this will happen?HysteriaSince we began our senior cycle, we have been building up to the Leaving Cert exams. Even in normal times there is hysteria and pressure attached to this set of exams it has multiplied many times over against the backdrop of the current crisis.Wellbeing is now a subject which forms a key part of the school curriculum - but it is hypocritical to teach something that cannot be practiced in reality. The uncertainty over these exams risks obliterating our own mental health. In the words of Greta Thunberg: “I should be in school”.The State Examinations Commission must now consider predicted results as a means of grading students. At a time of global anxiety and uncertainty, it is only right that students should be given this option on a once-off basis. Predicted grades for 2020 would, at the very least, allay the fears of students across Ireland in these troubled\u0026nbsptimes.Lucy Donegan is a sixth year student and Leaving Certificate candidate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

It’s a very rapid progression of disease of some people, especially the elderly and immunocompromised, and that’s scary. This is something that none of us clinicians have ever seen before.”The scope of the epidemic in Ireland was being “misrepresented” by a reliance on figures based on limited testing, Dr Lambert said.“How can you talk about flattening the curve where you’re testing such small numbers of people and people are queuing up to get testing?”“And then there’s results that are pending for a week, so the numbers represent our lack of supplies for testing rather than flattening the curve.”Upscaling of testing was urgently needed in order to flatten the curve, he said. “And then as soon as those test results are available, which should be in 24 hours, you contact trace everyone who has had a significant exposure.”“South Korea and Singapore and many of the other countries have been able to flatten the curve didn’t do it just by putting people in isolation and reporting numbers. They did it by testing and very strict contact tracing. That’s what that’s what we need to be doing”Dr Lambert said a “master plan” was needed in order to “win the war” on coronavirus. “You can’t fight one battle more than another battle. You have to have a master plan and fight all of the battles in parallel. The testing plan. The shutdown plan. The contact tracing plan. The community plan, as so on.”Pointing to official advice to people to sanitise their hands on leaving a public space, he said this was equally necessary on entering the premises. A Department of Health official could be reassigned to draw up a sanitation plan to reflect this, he suggested.He added: “We need to sit down and put together a plan today for the anticipated surge of lots of elderly who are going to be dying, to make sure that they’re supported in a dignified death and given access to all the appropriate palliative care services that they deserve”.Dr Lambert criticised the lack of “clinical representation at high-level planning committees for the epidemic. “They’ve got consultations from clinicians, but I think clinicians have to be at the table on a day to day basis at the top committees making decisions.”While Ireland is “way ahead” of other European countries, and “ahead of the game” in some respects, in some situations actions are being taken “a day too late”.“If you don’t scale up (testing) you’ll just have to shut down and shut down and shut down.”In the early stages of the outbreak, many people “fell through the cracks” because Covid-19 wasn’t suspected or staff were not using PPE. Some patients present with unusual symptoms such as diarrhoea or seizures, he pointed out, while we have learned the virus can exist on surfaces “for days and days”.However, hospitals have since lowered their threshold for suspect cases of the disease and are “meticulously” wearing PPE, so the proportion of healthcare workers infected can be expected to drop over time.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4219865.1585906732!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the science the merits of app trackers and face masks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA computer image created by Nexu Science Communication together with Trinity College in Dublin, shows a model structurally representative of a betacoronavirus which is the type of virus linked to Covid-19. Photograph: Nexu Science CommunicationReuters.The HSE is set to roll out the use of a smartphone app to facilitate contact tracing in Ireland. When the owner of a device with this app installed tests positive for Covid-19, data may enable tracing to take place more efficiently and more quickly.Apps, which allow people to move around after lockdown, have become an integral part of Chinese authorities’ management of citizens. They give users colour-coded designations based on their health status and travel history, and a QR code that can be scanned by authorities.The apps are specific to each city or province. People given a green code are allowed to travel relatively freely. A yellow code indicates the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code says the user is a confirmed Covid-19 patient and should be in quarantine.Privacy issues aside, apps initially provide indication of infection within communities. Once a peak is negotiated, they can provide key data while rowing back on lock-in measures.An Oxford University study published in Science underlines the merits of an app using bluetooth to keep a log of all other app users a person has been in close proximity with over a few days.Epidemiologist Prof Keith Neal of the University of Nottingham says it does not provide any direct evidence apps control epidemics without the need for quarantine. “They are probably contributing to management of the epidemic,” he concedes.“One concern is that geotracking is a key part in the methodology. If too few people sign up it can only have minimal benefit. Uptake would need to be high and too many people may complain about the big brother aspect of the methods and opt out.”If used, it could always be deleted afterwards from the phone when the epidemic is over, he notes. All told, “It is well worth trying.”Contrasting views on merits of wearing face masksAustria has made wearing face masks outside the home compulsory. Now other EU countries are considering changing their position. France initially advised its citizens not to wear masks, then said they should if they were infected or working in care or retail. Resolving differing messages may be at hand.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is having second thoughts on its advice that people did not need to wear them unless they were sick and coughing, or were caring for someone who was. Cases doubling every two to three days in the country is prompting re-evaluation.CDC data show high rates of transmission by people who are infected but don’t know it yet. An infected person can be contagious for 48 hours before developing symptoms, if they get them at all. Wearing a mask could cut down on the number of transmissions from asymptomatic people.It is now considering whether to recommend everybody wear one when out in public but not a high-grade “N95” medical mask. Those are scarce as evidenced by huge shortages on healthcare frontlines.Ordinary surgical masks and even homemade masks will do in helping to slow transmission in the community, though they don’t ensure complete protection for wearers, it says. while wearing any kind of mask, even a bandanna, will make you less likely to touch your face – an important route for infection.The WHO, however, has been recommending people not wear a face mask unless they are sick with Covid-19 or caring for someone who is sick on the basis that there was no specific evidence to suggest wearing of masks by mass populations has any potential benefit.“In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite, in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly,” insisted its health emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan.“Right now the people most at risk from this virus are frontline health workers who are exposed to the virus every second of every day. The thought of them not having masks is horrific,” he said at a briefing.But new evidence from Hong Kong has prompted a reconsideration of the role of face masks since, which is set to prompt a big change in advice. And the WHO is pragmatic and changing its position in line with what science is saying.The scale of global research efforts to counter Covid-19 is awesome. Most effort is concentrated on generating vaccines, treatments and enhancedquicker testing ability for the virus, and for antibodies post infection.Accuratequick antibody tests will soon become critical in countries that have blunted that rising cases curve because it will determine to what extent lock-in may be eased and when medical workers can return to frontline care.What is truly amazing is how speedily teams of scientists all over the world are engaged to evaluate collectively options with best potential – in a scenario where there is no cure for coronavirus.One glaring gap has emerged lack of understanding of psychological and social impacts caused by pandemics.Researchers at the University of Sheffield and Ulster University are addressing this by surveying 2,000 people, and hope their findings will help inform better management of future public health crises, including how quarantining people may affect their mental health.“This is one of the first studies of the ‘psychology of epidemics’ during perhaps one of the biggest existential threats the world has faced this century,” explained Dr Jilly Gibson-Miller, a specialist in health psychology.A rise in depression, anxiety, paranoia and authoritarian views, and reductions in people’s sense of trust and control over their own lives, is anticipated.“We know what an important role human behaviour plays in the spread of an epidemic,” she adds, “I’m particularly interested in the extent to which people are carrying out protective behaviours, such as hand-washing and social distancing, and whether they feel they have sufficient motivation, opportunity and capability to do so”Grounds for optimismCommunity action delivers: Contact tracing associated with confirmed Irish cases of Covid-19 shows infected people in early March had contact with 20 others on average. Curtailments forced that down to 5 by last week – and to just 3 in recent days coinciding with a near lock-in scenario. A stunning achievement by ordinary people but that darn curve has not been flattened yet.Pharma heavyweights make progress: Johnson \u0026amp Johnson have a potential vaccine that could be available early next year while Abbott Laboratories are launching a rapid test kit. The US government is to invest $1 billion in J\u0026ampJ’s candidate. Abbott’s test could take as little as five minutes and be run on a portable machine the size of a toaster.Testing enhancement: Scientists at the EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) have designed a new “control material” that labs can use to check the correct functioning of coronavirus tests.A positive control material guarantees laboratory tests are working correctly and are harmonised. It is used to prevent a test giving a negative result even if the person is positive. In this case, it is a synthetic, non-infectious part of the virus.The JRC identified a potential gap in management of the pandemic and immediately set to work to fill that gap. It has the potential to improve capacity to respond and avoid valuable resources being wasted by inefficient tests.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4219453.1585857976!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk makes another coronavirus u turn but doubts over strategy linger","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMatt Hancock: out of self-isolation just a week after his positive coronavirus test. Photograph: Pippa Fowles10 Downing StreetAFP via GettyAfter a succession of daily press briefings from Downing Street that saw ministers fail hopelessly to answer reporters’ questions about coronavirus, Matt Hancock’s performance on Thursday evening looked almost like a tour de force. The health secretary, fresh out of self-isolation after testing positive for the virus himself, gave lengthy answers and invited follow-up questions in a briefing that lasted almost three times as long as usual.Unlike his colleagues earlier in the week, he had a big announcement to make as he set a goal of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April. He acknowledged public disquiet over the slow pace of testing in the UK, which has struggled to reach 10,000 a day, saying he understands why the government’s approach has faced criticism.But Hancock’s apparent candour and the determination with which he set out a five-point plan to scale up testing could not disguise the dramatic U-turn he was performing or obscure the doubts that linger over the new strategy.The health secretary’s press briefing followed a video message on Wednesday night from a distinctly peaky-looking Boris Johnson, who has also tested positive for coronavirus and remains in self-isolation in Downing Street.“I want to say a special word about testing because it is so important. As I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through: this is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle, this is how we will defeat it in the end,” the prime minister said.Just a week ago, however, deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was dismissing the World Health Organisation’s injunction to “test, test, test” as a message aimed at less developed countries than the UK. She said that “there comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention”, adding that the UK had always planned to focus on testing those who were admitted to hospital.Testing timesWhen Johnson promised two weeks ago to ramp up testing to 250,000 a day, he was referring to a blood test that could tell if someone has had the virus and has developed antibodies showing that they now hopefully have some immunity to it. But as John Newton, director of public health improvement for Public Health England, pointed out at Thursday’s press briefing, the focus should instead be on a swab antigen test that shows if someone has the virus now.“The initial priority, of course, is for the swab tests because those are tests which allow the NHS to manage critically ill patients to the best they possibly can and also to allow NHS staff and other key workers to come back to work when they can,” he said.“The antibody tests are ideally done 28 days after an infection, so in fact the requirement for the antibody test isn’t really with us yet. So the urgent priority – both types of tests are important, both are urgent – but the most urgent is the swab tests so that we can treat patients better and get staff back to work.”The government’s U-turn on testing came after usually friendly newspapers including the Daily Mail and the Daily  criticised the lack of testing for frontline National Health Service staff. Many doctors and nurses are off work because they or family members are displaying symptoms of the virus but they have been unable to get tested.Virus suppressionThe government’s pivot on testing follows its change of strategy last month away from a policy of trying to mitigate the virus towards suppressing it. In both cases, the change of direction is welcome and brings the UK into closer alignment with the international mainstream in combating the coronavirus.Each time, ministers and public health officials have denied that they have changed direction and have refused to admit that they may have wasted valuable time pursuing misguided strategies. And Hancock’s continued emphasis on antibody tests on Thursday suggests that the government remains attached to the hope that evidence of widespread immunity could be the way to get the UK back to work.He even endorsed the idea of an “immunity certificate” that those who have recovered from coronavirus could use as a passport back into work. Such a certificate could also offer an incentive to those who believe themselves young and strong enough to seek out the infection in the hope of surviving it easily and going back to work.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Prince Charles hails NHS Nightingale hospital: \u0026#39In this dark time, this place will be a shining light\u0026#39Politics latest news: Matt Hancock admits Government target to hit 100,000 tests per day is a \u0026#39big ask\u0026#39UK coronavirus lockdown: the new rules, and what they mean for daily lifeCan I get a private coronavirus test in the UK, and how much would it cost?How many coronavirus tests are being done in the UK? Coronavirus positive: good news round-up - a great summer of old sport, and a hand-washing orangutanHow many coronavirus cases are in your area?

However, in London, parks were full of joggers. One politan Police chief superintendent commented that the streets were busier than they should have been.Raj Kohli, borough commander of Camden, north London, said: I still think people think it\u0027s not as serious as it is. Exercise is fine but people need to use common sense - some are using exercise as an excuse to meet friends.There were fears, with a sunny weekend forecast at the start of what would have been the Easter holidays, that people would be tempted to leave their homes. But the Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman warned: If we need to take further steps we won\u0027t hesitate to do so ... We can\u0027t stress enough the vital importance of the public continuing to follow the guidance and continuing to stay at home wherever possible. The consequence of not doing so is potentially more lives being lost.The Government is scaling up its public health messaging with a series of adverts warning the public people will die if they don\u0027t stay home.A Savanta poll for The Daily  found the number of British adults in self-isolation dropped to 44 per cent yesterday compared with 55 on Monday and 46 on Tuesday. Those reporting they had left the house also rose, with almost half (47 per cent) saying they had gone out on Tuesday - 10 points higher than the 37 per cent who left the house on Monday. The survey also found a drop in the approval ratings of those handling the crisis, suggesting the public was beginning to question the Government\u0027s approach.Avon and Somerset Police said it had fined 23 people for defying lockdown measures. Several premises found flouting Government guidance were ordered to shut, including a Devon garden centre. Nottinghamshire Police shut the Blue Bell pub in Sutton-in-Ashfield after a tip-off about a lock-in on Saturday. Officers said the licensee faced prosecution for putting lives in danger. In Carmarthen, a councillor was fined for inviting friends to his pub, the Santa Clara, for a lock-in. Police fined Richard Pearce, having already issued him with a warning.In North Wales officers pulled over their own chief constable while running road checks. Carl Foulkes wrote on social media: This morning travelling to Wrexham to go out on patrol and pulled over by my own local policing officers, doing a great job, although their faces were a picture.

This is an open goal for them.”He said he found it odd that the Italian government had allowed the deployment to go ahead.“It’s incongruous that the Russians have been allowed into a Nato country on very superfluous grounds,” he told The . The Italians had little need for extra chemical, biological and radiological resources.“They are leaders in CBRN in Nato and within the EU. They are seen as the gold standard and have strong capability. I don’t think they need a batch of ageing Russian equipment,” said Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who left the British Army in 2012 with the rank of colonel.The fact that the mission is being led by a general, Sergei Kikot, is also suspicious.“Usually, for a mission of 100 soldiers or so you would expect a major to be in charge, or at most a colonel. To have a two-star general commanding them seems like overkill.”With Russia not yet badly affected by the virus, Moscow is taking advantage of the West’s vulnerability.“The Russians are brilliant at this. While there’s a big noise on your left, you do something on the right because no one is looking.”Offering help to Italy during the coronavirus emergency was sharply at odds with Moscow’s actions in Syria. “I help to run hospitals in Syria, where they were bombed to smithereens by the Russians. Now they are disinfecting hospitals in Italy. It’s Jekyll and Hyde,” said Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who is now a director of Doctors Under Fire, a charity which works in Syria.After an agreement was done between Giuseppe Conte, Italy’s prime minister, and Russian president Vladimir Putin, 15 Ilyushin Il-76 military transport planes landed at a military air force base south of Rome.After unloading their cargo, a convoy of their own trucks flying Russian flags drove north to Lombardy, the worst affected region in Italy.The dispatch of Russian aid to Italy was widely covered on Russian state television, with each step of the way filmed and broadcast on the main TV channels.  Russia’s defence ministry would not release the full list of the supplies sent to Italy but said they included a mobile lab for testing for viruses, disinfecting equipment and unspecified equipment designed to “help patients with coronavirus.”The defence ministry issues a daily bulletin about its activities in Italy, recounting how the Russian specialists have helped to disinfect hospitals and nursing homes.As well as General Kikot, who has worked on responding to anthrax outbreaks, the team is reported to include Colonel Gennady Eremin, an expert in bacteriological warfare who worked on the swine flu crisis, and Colonel Viacheslav Kulish, an expert in biological agent protective gear.  A Kremlin spokesman dismissed reports suggesting that Moscow sent the mission in the  hope that Italy would use its influence to get the EU to lift sanctions against Russia.“There certainly isn’t any discussion of any conditions or hopes or expectations,” Dmitry Peskov said last week.“Italy does need large amounts of aid, and what Russia is doing is providing the help that we can give. It’s absurd to suggest that we’re hoping for something else in return, that’s not the case.”Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s foreign minister, has bristled at criticism over accepting help from Russia, saying that in such a critical moment, all assistance is welcome. The Russians may also be trying to find out more about the deadly nature of Covid-19 in order to better fight the virus in their own country, said Germano Dottori, professor of strategic studies at LUISS University in Rome. “This is a fact-finding mission by Russia,” he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/01/TELEMMGLPICT000228902301_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbNWtAZp4M83CNbYcU41Ja5PBtShq1Cx9HGnISD2SOrk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"swedes rest world engaging reckless experiment","story":"\u0026#39Stockholm is perhaps the last capital where there are signs of normal life\u0026#39Faced with what many there believe will be a manageable illness, Sweden has decided – for now at least – that lockdown represents a greater riskNow and again, my wife asks if it’s worth getting Swedish passports for our children. She has never got around to seeking British citizenship and I try to tell her that she’d better get her skates on before Priti Patel comes around asking for her papers. But the kids: how would a Swedish passport possibly benefit them? We run through what might go wrong for a country and, in every eventuality, Britain always seems the better bet. But now Swedes have a fresh argument: that their country might be the only one in Europe to come out of the corona crisis with the economy semi-intact.There is, still, no lockdown there. Shopping centres remain open, as are most schools and firms. Many work from home, many don’t – all are at liberty to choose. When I called a friend in Stockholm to ask about the Swedish experiment, he was on his way to a book launch. He’s still taking his sons to football matches and is proud that Sweden is keeping calm and carrying on. To him there is no Swedish experiment: it’s the rest of Europe that is experimenting – by locking down economies in response to a virus which may prove to be no more deadly than flu.It’s not that Sweden is in denial. It has had 5,466 confirmed cases, 282 deaths. Coronavirus has been found in a third of Stockholm’s (many) elderly care homes. But the debate there is still where the British debate was three weeks ago when the Prime Minister was resisting lockdown. This changed for Britain when Imperial College London published its study suggesting that avoiding lockdown could mean 250,000 deaths. This logic applies to Sweden – but the country of the Nobel Prize and the Karolinska Institute believes its own experts. They disagree with Imperial. They still see Covid-19 as a manageable risk.The face of Sweden’s response has been Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist, who has held daily press conferences. Politicians have taken a back seat. His team have published their own assessment of the virus and its likely trajectory, showing it peaking with about 250 needing intensive care in Stockholm. The nation’s hospitals, he says, can cope. A 600-bed temporary ward is opening tomorrow, south of the city – and when it does, a quarter of all intensive care beds will be used. So for now, no reason to impose any more restrictions.He urges caution, and Swedes are responding. Sixth formers and university students are learning from home. Sports fixtures continue, but with spectators more spaced out. Online meet-ups are replacing real ones, elbow-bumping (remember that?) replaced handshakes long ago. A naturally cautious country is taking Tegnell’s advice.But crucially, he isn’t asking Swedes to trust him. Hospital data is published all the time, so Sweden’s “experiment” is being conducted in the open. Every time a patient is admitted, the data is updated on a Covid live website in striking detail. Average age: 60. Those with diabetes: 26 per cent. With cardiovascular or lung disease: 24 per cent. With at least one other underlying health condition: 77 per cent. Sweden is also updating its statistics to say if someone died from Covid, or of something else – but with Covid. This might reduce the “death” figure by two thirds.If Tegnell’s analysis proves wrong, the public will be able to see it unravel on his dashboard. In which case, he says, he stands ready to tighten things up. Sweden’s famous love of transparency – you can look up your neighbour’s salary online if you feel the urge – is being used as a tool to foster trust. So far, it’s working: polls show that three quarters of Swedes support the strategy. The debate, overall, is very different from Britain’s. There is no shortage of epidemiologists in the Swedish press, backing Tegnell and denouncing the “desk-based theory” of the Imperial College study.The Swedish prime minister is asked if he has ceded power to Tegnell: he doesn’t seem offended. Time will tell if we made the right choice, he says. Over here, this would be seen as dangerous, even heartless. Doesn’t he want to save lives? But Swedes are also looking at Britain’s surging unemployment, one in five small firms on the verge of going bust, children deprived of education, working mothers edged out of their job. That also hits lives.And this case is being made, in Sweden, in a way it might not be over here. Kerstin Hessius, who runs a government pension fund, has been arguing that money vs lives is a false choice. Rising unemployment hits pensions directly,” she says. “What’s more, the tax base disappears – then we have to start cutting welfare.” And Swedes should be proud that “we have not extinguished the entire society, as many other countries have done”.The risk is pretty obvious. Tegnell might soon find out that the virus spreads far faster than he thought – and by then it would be too late. Sweden’s hospitals would be overrun. A letter signed by 2,000 luminaries appeared in the papers this week saying it was time for Sweden to fall in line with the rest of the world. Åre, where I had hoped to be skiing next week, will shut its lifts the week leading up to Easter. Posters had started appearing in train stations, put up by locals, telling visitors they were endangering lives by refusing to stay home.Sweden is not immune from what is, now, a fierce global recession. Unemployment has spiked and bailouts have started – albeit ones that will be easier to pay off than Britain’s. Swedes tend to have more of a sense of the economy as the engine of the welfare state: damage one, and you damage the other. You also damage public health, society, education and democracy. As one former politician told me, Sweden is not resisting lockdown in spite of being a strong social democratic state. It’s doing it because it’s a strong social democratic state.For now, Stockholm is perhaps the last capital in Europe where there are signs of normal life – with shoppers, skateboarders, pensioners and commuters (albeit in far fewer numbers). They know who to thank for their liberty. On Vasagatan, there’s a poster taped to a wall saying “All power to Tegnell, state epidemiologist”. Whether they’ll be saying this at the end of the month is, of course, another question entirely.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

All but two of the new cases involved travellers from overseas.Total number of infections in the mainland, which excludes asymptomatic patients, now stands at 81,620, while the death toll rose by four to 3,322. Worldwide, the number of cases has topped 1 million, with at least 52,000 deaths.Beijing has pushed the country\u0027s industries to go back to work as the epidemic eases, hoping for a quick recovery from what many analysts expect to have been a deep contraction for China\u0027s economy in the first quarter.Top officials however remain concerned about the risk of a second wave of infections.Wuhan Communist Party chief Wang Zhonglin said the threat of a rebound in the central city\u0027s coronavirus epidemic remained high and ordered residents to avoid leaving their homes unless it was necessary to do so.The comments came about two weeks after officials eased the total lockdown of Wuhan and allowed some its 11 million inhabitants to go outside for the first time since Jan. 23, though they were still not able to leave the city.The capital of central Hubei province has been the hardest hit by the virus, with 50,007 cases reported.The city is scheduled to allow people to travel outside the city on April 8, and volunteers in hazmat suits have been spraying public areas with disinfectant in preparation for an increase in activity.Restrictions have been gradually reimposed in other parts of China as well, including closures of cinemas that had been permitted to reopen.A county in the central province of Henan on Wednesday banned people from leaving without proper authorisation and prevented residents from leaving their homes for work without clearance following several coronavirus infections in the area.Top officials are also ordering local health authorities to step up detection, monitoring and supervision of the infected patients who do not show symptoms.Wuhan alone reported 51 new asymptomatic cases and said 705 people who had the virus but showed no symptoms remained under medical observation.Beijing has also indefinitely banned foreigners from entering the country to curb cases involving travellers from overseas, though it has chartered planes to repatriate Chinese nationals in countries with severe outbreaks.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/21/15/credit-cards.jpg","title":"coronavirus overdrafts interest free credit card payments banks","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Credit card and loan repayments to be frozen for customers in financial difficulty as pandemic causes unemployment to soarBanks have been told to allow customers an extra £500 interest-free on their existing overdrafts\u0026nbspto help people who are struggling financially during the coronavirus outbreak.They have also been ordered to freeze payments on credit cards and loans.The City watchdog is proposing a range of measures that could be introduced as soon as next Thursday, to help those finding it difficult to make repayments\u0026nbspon their debts.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBanks had already been under scrutiny from the Financial Conduct Authority over their approach to overdraft interest rates, which are around 40 per cent for most high street lenders –\u0026nbsproughly double the cost of an average credit card.More people are likely to have to use their overdraft during the crisis.The Department for Work and Pensions revealed this week that it had received\u0026nbsp950,000 claims for Universal Credit in just two weeks.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastUnder the FCA’s plans, customers can ask their bank to freeze payments on their credit cards and personal loans if they are having trouble repaying because of coronavirus.However, consumers will still accrue interest on their credit cards during the repayment holiday, which they will have to pay off at some point.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “This is yet another, important, welcome, yet unprecedented coronavirus-driven market intervention – this time by the regulator.“We have already seen many unsecured lenders put some forbearance criteria in place, a few even more generous than the minimum standards the FCA is imposing – such as entire overdrafts at 0 per cent.“However the provision is patchy and has become a banking lottery and that’s unfair – no one could’ve taken into account when they signed up for products how considerate each lender would be in these extraordinary times.”A brief consultation on the proposals is under way until Monday with changes to be implemented on Thursday, if agreed.

The UK chief medical adviser, Professor Chris Whitty, has said that a vaccine is £one way out of this ... and we all hope that will happen as quickly as possible.US scientists say they have developed a potential coronavirus vaccine that produces antibodies capable of fighting the virus and will apply for ‘investigational new drug’ approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResearchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine found the vaccine, tested on mice, produced antibodies in quantities thought to be enough to “neutralise” Covid-19 within two weeks of injection.The team are far from alone: the World Health Organisation says there are at least 20 coronavirus vaccines are in developmental stages around the world, with the first human trials already beginning in Seattle, led by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna. The trial is backed by the national institutes of health (NIH) and Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe speed at which Moderna’s vaccine is entering human trials is unprecedented, largely thanks to Chinese scientists sharing the genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2 — a move that allowed research groups to grow the live virus and study its behaviour. Researchers were given permission to skip the usual animal testing phase.In the UK, scientists from Imperial College London said earlier this month they have a “prototype vaccine” with “encouraging” results that could soon be tested on humans.Dr Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at the university’s department of infectious disease said: “It is a global effort. We are not racing against each other – we are racing against the virus.”But despite the number of teams working at breakneck speed to develop a vaccine, it could still take around 18 months for any potential vaccine to become available to the general public.Anthony Fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases in the US and one of Donald Trump’s top health officials, said the process of developing a vaccine “is going to take a year, year-and-a-half at least”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The phases begin with a small pool of healthy volunteers to test the vaccine for safety and monitor it for adverse effects. Next, a larger pool of several hundred people are tested to monitor how effective the vaccine is, and lastly, the same process is repeated in a pool of several thousand people.Scientists also have to make allowances for variables in the pools of people being tested. Candidates are randomly assigned to either treatment groups or control groups to determine the efficacy of treatments being administered, but some outcomes may prove to be ineffective or unsafe, or both.Ultimately, scientists must still adhered to the strict protocol involved in developing potential vaccines despite the pressure to move quickly.

Last week, a veteran coronavirus research team raised hopes when they found that Covid-19 is not mutating at a level that could make it far more dangerous.Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo pledge £2.5m to help battle virusDr Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch, told The Independent that the lack of mutation was “good news” because “we could reasonably argue that vaccines would work against most of the strains out there”.Britain is the largest contributor to an international bid to find a coronavirus vaccine, committing a total of £250m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).The funding was announced after Boris Johnson took part in a video conference of the G20 group, where leaders of the world’s largest economies pledged to deliver a “transparent, robust, coordinated, large-scale and science-based global response in the spirit of solidarity”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

How about a tablecloth instead of a pizza box?”Interestingly, this scene was edited in the UK upon the film’s release, with the BBFC site writing: “The scene where Lilo hides from her older sister in the dryer had to be edited to get an U-Rating.“The appliance was therefore changed to a commode with a pizza box to prevent little kids from imitating to hide in the dryer.”One other user said:\u0026nbspKids aren’t going to crawl into their dryers,\u0026nbspbut I’ve never heard of a kid hiding in a pizza box either.\u0026nbspIt’s annoying how they’ve changed scenes in some of the older films.”One of Disney’s bosses recently revealed it had no plans to add Oscar-winning film Song of the South to Disney+ due to its racist stereotypes.We may earn commission from some of the links in this article, but we never allow this to influence our contentHere is a guide to the best original content to watch on Disney+.Lilo and Stitch\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The patch is stuck on like a plaster and the needles – which are made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces – simply dissolve into the skin.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The antibody levels of the rodents vaccinated against Covid-19 “seem to be following the same trend,” according to the researchers.The team\u0026nbspfound the\u0026nbspCovid-19 microneedle vaccine maintained\u0026nbspits potency even after being sterilised with gamma radiation, an important step in making the drug suitable for use in humans.Testing in patients\u0026nbspwould “typically require at least a year and probably longer”, Prof Falo said.\u0026nbspBut he added: “This particular situation is different from anything we’ve ever seen, so we don’t know how long the clinical development process will take. Recently announced revisions to the normal processes suggest we may be able to advance this faster.”Scientists in Australia announced on Thursday they had begun testing another potential Covid-19 vaccine on ferrets, with a team at the University of\u0026nbspOxford set to trial the same drug on humans in the next few weeks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He said: “If you’re in a fortunate position, I ask you to volunteer to help those less fortunate.

Otherwise he’s going to be putting you under pressure to do things that you can’t do. So it’s in the government’s interest as well as in democracy’s interest for that sort of meeting and discussion to take place.”When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastBut asked whether Labour should be offering its support to the government to help the country get through the coronavirus crisis, Mr Corbyn told the Daily ’s Chopper’s Podcast: ”It’s the duty of opposition parties to hold it up into account and that is exactly what we’re doing.Mr Corbyn has said that Labour would have moved faster to ramp up Covid-19 testing if he had been in power.“I think we should be challenging the government and challenging them on the economic response, challenging them on job security, and that is the way to get better government and better decisions,” he said.“If everybody got together and said ‘we’re all absolutely in this together we won’t criticise each other’ – that is a negation of what our democratic society is about.”But leadership contender Lisa Nandy repeated her call for a “national Cobra” emergency committee, in which government ministers would be joined by representatives of opposition parties and devolved governments, and said that Labour should be offering ideas on how to defeat the virus.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A key ally of the current left-wing leadership of the party, the Salford \u0026amp Eccles MP is viewed in some quarters as the natural successor to Mr Corbyn and describes herself as a “proud socialist”. Highly regarded by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. She won also won plaudits for her performance filling in for Corbyn both at prime minister’s questions and during the general election debates.Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has joined the contest for deputy leadership of the party. After ruling herself out of running for the leadership, the Ashton-under-Lynne MP launched her bid for deputy warning that Labour faces the biggest challenge in its history and must win or die. She is close with leadership contender Rebecca Long BaileyShadow sport minister Rosena Allin-Khan said Labour need to listen with humility to lost voters as she launched her bid for the deputy leadership. Writing in The Independent, the MP for Tooting refelcted: We shouldn’t have ignored the warning signs in Scotland, and now we’ve paid the price in northern England, across the midlands and in Wales.Shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler was first to announce her bid for the deputy leadership.

If equality, humanity, honesty and kindness are called Corbynism, then that’s all right with me.With Starmer thought likely to sideline the hard left if he defeats “continuity Corbyn” candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey as expected on Saturday, Ms Alvarez sent a defiant message to her husband’s supporters not to abandon his cause.“I will never regret our dream of a better quality of life for everybody,” she said.“It is now up to our movement to ensure it does not remain a dream.”Mr Corbyn himself indicated he may resume his role as a backbench rebel under the new leadership, saying: “It depends what the votes are and what the issues are – I always believe in being true to oneself.”He added: “I will be doing my best to encourage others to be active and to stand up for all the causes that I believe so passionately in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I found her very impressive and she will no doubt do a very good job at a very difficult time.”As deputy chief of defence staff, General Barrons was in charge of the military support for national resilience and security in natural or man-made disasters as well as conflicts.He told The Independent: “The potential risk of global pandemic has been with us for a very long time.\u0026nbspQuestions have to be asked of the government, industry and civil society on the level of preparedness when this pandemic occurred.Coronavirus: Experts cast doubt on UK plan for ‘herd immunity’“We can’t have been completely surprised. In the future we obviously need to be better prepared. But we must not make the mistake of thinking that it’s all just about pandemics.

It was set up 10 years ago by the Cameron government and ownership is shared between its staff, the Cabinet Office and the charity Nesta which deals with innovations.David Halpern, BIT’s chief executive, and a member of the Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) outlined to the BBC on 11 March the approach of shielding vulnerable people until enough of the country’s population had been infected with Covid-19, and immunity would be acquired to halt its spread.“There’s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don’t catch the disease. By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population,”\u0026nbsphe said.On the same day Dominic Cummings, the chief advisor to Boris Johnson, is reported to have brought up the issue of herd immunity in a discussion with tech industry leaders. Two days later the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told BBC Radio 4 that one of\u0026nbspthe key things we need to do\u0026nbspis to “build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission”.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted a few days later that achieving herd immunity was not a stated policy. Instead, he said, “in the coming weeks” people over the age of 70 will be told to self-isolate.Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the medical journal Lancet told the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee at the end of last month that SAGE, despite being chaired by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, had little input from public health doctors and medical officers. The dominant voices advising the government, he said, were mathematical modellers and behavioural scientists, including Dr Halpern.“There is evidence on modelling and on behavioural science, but I don’t see the evidence from the public health community or from the clinical community,” he said.“We thought we could have a controlled epidemic. We thought we could manage that epidemic over the course of March and April, push the curve to the right, build up herd immunity and that way we could protect people. The reason why that strategy was wrong is it didn’t recognise that 20 per cent of people infected would end up with severe critical illness. The evidence was there at the end of January.”A senior Whitehall official involved with Covid-19 planning held, however, that Dr Halpern was explaining the theory of “herd immunity”, not advocating it. He said “a lot will come out in the future about what happened, not just the role of advisers, but politicians as well, I have no doubt that a lot of it very interesting for the public”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

How could what appeared to be a few cases of a new strain of flu in China – and with even that news largely being lost amid religious festivities and new year celebrations – spread and\u0026nbspsnap the world shut?While there are nations where its vice-like hold has been most life-transforming and deadly – China, Italy, Iran, Spain,\u0026nbspand now the US – perhaps without exception, nowhere has escaped its impact.For many of us, the first reported cases and deaths\u0026nbspfelt far away and literally foreign. Now, as the global number of confirmed infections (collated by Johns Hopkins University) passes one million, they are close to hand and among us.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe know of people who have died, or else been taken sick. Lots of us have most likely already been infected, but without testing we cannot be certain.Those of us fortunate enough to have jobs and homes are hunkered down, anxious and grey-edged, learning new skills such as social distancing, on which our health, or that of our neighbours, somehow depends. We cannot see the virus but we know it is there.Everyone whose lives are now upended will have their own mark on the calendar for when the coronavirus crisis became truly real. Was it the day there were long, long lines at the shop, and shelves were bare? Was it when stern-faced politicians told us to stay inside? Was it when Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson said they too had tested positive, or when the heir to the British throne was forced to self-quarantine at Balmoral?It may have been something much more personal – when a child’s school was ordered to be shut, a favourite music festival was cancelled, or sports competition such as the\u0026nbspPremier League\u0026nbspshuttered for the season. Fear and disappointment, and even some guilt for feeling such frustrations, mingling into one.Here are some of the key points of this unfolding story:There are few certainties about the coronavirus crisis, but is believed Wei Guixian, 57, a shrimp seller at Wuhan Huanan Seafood Market, was the first person infected with the virus, itself thought to have originated in bats. According to The Wall Street Journal, she reported feeling ill on this day and would be among several dozen from the market subsequently diagnosed with the virus. “I felt a bit tired, but not as tired as previous years,” she told Chinese media. “Every winter, I always suffer from the flu. So I thought it was the flu.”Precisely how she was infected remains unclear. The South China Morning Post said Chinese government documents suggested the infection dated to 17\u0026nbspNovember. While doctors in Wuhan were alerted to the illness, the world was not. On 31 December, Chinese authorities confirmed to the World Health Organisation there were dozens of cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause. On 1 January 2020, the US Centres for Disease Control identified the seafood market as the likely hotspot. On 7 January, China isolated the virus and said it was a new kind of coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). On 11 January, China confirmed the first fatality, a 61-year-old man from Wuhan. The next day, China shared the virus’s unique genetic code with the rest of the world.13 January\u0026nbsp2020: Not just ChinaNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThat this was not just China’s problem became clear when the WHO confirmed the first cases outside of the country, namely in Thailand, and then later Japan and South Korea, albeit of people who had travelled from Wuhan. At that point, the WHO said there were just 282 confirmed infections, in four countries. On 21 January, the US reported its first case, a US citizen of Chinese origin who had visited family in Wuhan, and felt ill after returning home to Snohomish County, north of Seattle.“This is certainly not a moment for panic or high anxiety, it is a moment for vigilance,” said Washington state governor Jay Inslee. “There’s nowhere in Snohomish County I’d be reluctant to take my new granddaughter or family members.” Soon afterwards, India, the second most heavily populated country after China, announced its first case. On 31 January, Spain, Russia, Sweden and Britain confirm their first cases. Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the first two infections were members of the same family. “The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried-and-tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread,” he said.22 January\u0026nbsp2020: Trump and the virusThe president’s first public remarks about what he frequently termed the “Chinese virus” was in a TV interview with CNBC\u0026nbspat the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a day after the first US case was confirmed. Was he fearful of pandemic? “No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control,” he replied. “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”Trump would repeatedly play down its threat, accusing his political opponents of hyping it\u0026nbspto try to bring him down. He questioned top scientists and disputed it was “inevitable” that it would spread across the US. On 31 January, in a rare piece of decisive action, he barred travellers from China. He told state governors, his own supporters and Fox News anchors it would disperse with the onset of warmer weather and on 28 February\u0026nbspclaimed: “It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” On 4 March\u0026nbsphe voiced “a hunch” the mortality rate was lower that the WHO predicted. Even when the US was obliged to enact closures and social distancing, Trump insisted he knew best. On 24 March\u0026nbsphe said at the White House he hoped shuttered businesses would be open by April.19 February\u0026nbsp2020: Spain’s love of the beautiful game turns deadlySpain recorded its first case of infection on 31 January. But the day that may have been crucial to turning the nation into a hot spot – it currently has the second highest number of deaths (10,003) – may have been 19 February.That day, almost 3,000 Valencia football fans travelled from Spain to Milan to watch their team play Atalanta in a Champions League game. Some 40,000 Italians were also at the game, many of them from Bergamo and surrounding towns. “It is clear on that evening there was an opportunity for a strong spread of the virus,” the mayor of Bergamo, Giorgio Gori, told\u0026nbspCNN. Others agree. Immunologist Francesco Le Foche told Corriere dello Sport: “It’s probable that there were several major triggers and catalysts for the diffusion of the virus, but the Atalanta-Valencia game could very well have been one of them. With hindsight, it was madness to play with a crowd present, but at the time things weren’t clear enough.”The virus rapidly spread, overwhelming hospitals in way Italy and other nations also experienced. On 15 March, Spain reported about 2,000 new coronavirus cases and more than 100 deaths over a 24-hour period.\u0026nbspThis week, the death toll in a single day hit 849, triggering anger among a population already frustrated after three weeks of lockdown ordered by the government. Al Jazeera reported that anger worsened after video footage emerged of police in the Basque region hitting a man of Moroccan background with a baton after stopping him and asking him to see his papers, while trying to enforce a curfew.The first reports of the disease in Italy were on 30 January, when prime minister, Giuseppe Conte\u0026nbsptold a press conference two Chinese tourists had the disease and flights\u0026nbspfrom China were being suspended. He declared a national emergency, but said: “We have already prepared all the precautionary measures to isolate these two cases. There is no reason to create social alarm or panic.”How unfortunate his words now appear. On 20 February, a man in the northern Lombardy region tests positive. He is believed to have infected many others. Three days later, small towns reported outbreaks, and infections reached 150. By 24 February, the spike made Italy the worst hit nation in Europe, with six deaths. With hindsight, 24 February\u0026nbspwas a mere presage of what was to come, as the authorities struggled to react quickly enough. Hospitals, part of one of the best healthcare systems, were soon overrun, newspaper obituary pages began to explode and burials of the dead had to be performed many miles from where people died. On 9 March, with 9,172 cases reported, the nation was placed under lockdown. In cities such as Rome, people stood on their balconies to bang pots or sink the national anthem to try to\u0026nbsplift their spirits. Elsewhere in Europe, people looked on with horror and wondered if they would be next. Several nations, most notably Spain and France, would also soon be reeling.“Italy looked at the example of China, not as a practical warning, but as a science fiction movie that had nothing to do with us,” Italian health minister Sandra Zampa told The New York Times. “And when the virus exploded, Europe\u0026nbsplooked at us the same way we looked at China.” Infections in Italy have now passed 100,000, with at least 13,000 deaths.25 February: Iran’s deputy health minister says he has virusFew things more clearly underscored the threat to Iran from the virus than images of deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi Tabrizi sweating profusely at a press conference. The following day, he confirmed he had tested positive.“I wanted to tell you that I got corona,” he said in a video posted on social media. “I had a fever yesterday. The tests came back positive last night. I isolated myself.”The country’s first reported cases of the virus had come less than a week earlier, on 19 February, and related to two deaths in the pilgrimage city of Qom. They were apparently triggered by a merchant who had travelled to Wuhan. Within days, cases started being reported in much of the country. Before long, 1,000 new infections were being reported every day, with up to 100 deaths. Iranian officials, seeking to avoid public anger, as they sought to establish field hospitals and additional facilities, blamed US sanctions, reimposed after Washington pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal.“Health is a principle for us, but the production and security of society is also a principle for us,” Iranian president Hassan Rouhani told a cabinet meeting. “This is not a time for political war.”The US claimed it offered to provide help to Tehran, with secretary of state Mike Pompeo telling Congress it had made the offer through the Swiss authorities, given there was no formal diplomatic contact. In all likelihood, he knew it would not be\u0026nbspaccepted, such was the fractured relationship. Pompeo would accuse Iranian leaders of failing their people. “The Iranian leadership is trying to avoid responsibility for their grossly incompetent and deadly government,” he claimed.Iran quickly became overrun with the disease, emerging as having the seventh highest number of infections, currently at 50,468, and the fifth highest number of deaths at more than 3,000.29 February: South Korea flattens the curveHaving detected its first confirmed case on 20 January, within a month the disease had spread wildly in South Korea, a country of\u0026nbsp51 million. On 29 February, officials reported 909 new cases that day alone. But it also marked the worst day, a day from which things would start to get better, not worse. From that point, new infections started to drop, the result of an aggressive programme of testing, and the production of more than 100,000 testing kits. In cities such as Daegu, where the virus spread through a religious cult, officials rapidly imposed emergency measures.But it was the widespread and repeated testing – one estimate suggested South Korea per capita has carried out 40 times more tests than the US – that lay at the core of its ability to halt the spread. This was how infected people could be treated and isolated.South Korea remains the only major nation other than China to have “flattened the curve” and has become and example others are trying to emulate.\u0026nbspSouth Korea currently lists fewer than 10,000 infections, with 150 deaths. Data also shows more than 5,000 who were infected have since recovered.The spread of the virus and the impact on economies – lay-offs, furloughs and downturn – has had a devastating impact on stock markets around the world. In the US, among the most dramatic days was 12 March\u0026nbspwhen stocks tumbled to their worst losses since the Black Monday crash of 1987.The S\u0026ampP 500 plummeted 9.5 per cent cent, for a total drop of 26.7 per cent from its all-time high, set just last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 10 per cent\u0026nbspin its worst day since a nearly 23 per cent drop on 19 October\u0026nbsp1987.European markets lost 12 per cent in one of their worst days ever, even after the European Central Bank pledged to buy more bonds and offer more help for the economy. The Associated Press pointed out the losses came amid a cascade of cancellations and shutdowns across the globe including Donald Trump’s suspension of most travel to the US from Europe.A few days later, on 16 March, markets plunged again as the president said it was possible emergency measures to counter the virus could need to be in place until August, a comment he subsequently sought to pull back from.“The news just continues to get worse, and the travel ban puts an exclamation point on the weakness we’re going to see in global GDP and, in turn, the US,”\u0026nbspLiz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told AP. “We’re starting to get a sense of how dire the impact on the economy is going to be. Each day the news doesn’t get better, it gets worse. It’s now has hit Main Street to a more significant degree.”Markets have recovered somewhat, mainly as a result of the calm that was created when Trump and Congress worked to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package that the president signed into law on 27 March.Li Wenliang, a 33-year-old doctor in Wuhan, started\u0026nbspsharing messages about cases of a mysterious illness in late December. He was not certain, but he believed it was a new kind of coronavirus, a belief that was reinforced when he saw details of a report from Wuhan Central of\u0026nbspSars-like symptoms. In a group chat he believed was private, he posted under a headline that said:\u0026nbsp“Seven cases of Sars from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market”. His comments got widely spread, and officials pounced, arresting him and forcing him to say he had “seriously disrupted social order”.He was allowed to continue seeing patients, doing what he could to help stop the disease that was spreading across his adopted home. It was little surprise he would be among its victims, having apparently caught the illness from a patient he treated on 8 January. On 1 February, in his final note on Weibo, he said: “The test results come out positive today. Everything is settled. It is confirmed.”On 6 February he died of the illness. A final photograph showed\u0026nbsphim in a\u0026nbsphospital bed, wearing a ventilator, and holding up his ID card as he lay dying, which only helped accentuate what the disease had taken from him.His death caused widespread anger in China. People felt let down by the authorities. It was also a focus for criticism of Beijing from the west, which accused authorities of covering up how bad the situation was, and then silencing whistleblowers. Fearful of protests, officials deleted a number of posts from social media. Yet in a sign of the continuing public indignation, on 19 March, the authorities posthumously exonerated Li and cleared him of any charges. They also issued a “solemn apology” to his family, including his pregnant wife, and his son. To date, China has recorded more than 82,000 infections and 3,000 deaths.23 March\u0026nbsp2020:\u0026nbspBritish PM addressees the nation: ‘We need a huge national effort’Britons often like to refer to the “Blitz spirit”, a perhaps historically inaccurate term intended to echo how people pushed through during the Second World War amid adversity. It is a phrase much overused, not least by newspaper headline writers. Yet, Britons have nevertheless prided themselves on trying not to take things too seriously, Brexit accepted.This was what Boris Johnson was probably\u0026nbspreaching for when he addressed the nation on the evening of 23\u0026nbspMarch and ordered what was in effect a lockdown for much of the country. Businesses would be closed, but people could visit the supermarket and pharmacy, and – following an amendment to his plan – liquor stores. They could also exercise by taking a walk, but they were not permitted to do much else. People got angry when images were showed\u0026nbspon social media of crowded Tube carriages.But Johnson, who a few days later would announce he had tested positive for the\u0026nbspdisease, faced criticism over what was seen by many as a slow response, especially compared to the actions of European nations which had closed schools and non-essential businesses some time before.“The government has been too slow to act on this, and they’ve been slow as iniduals. I was surprised to see prime minister’s questions going ahead this week – it was clearly unnecessary,” Dr John Ashton, a former regional director of Public Health England, told The . “It reinforces the view that lockdown measures taken earlier this week should have been taken sooner.”24 March\u0026nbsp2020:\u0026nbspIndia seeks to avoid catastropheThe word’s second most populous country recorded its first case on 30 January. Almost two months later Narendra Modi ordered a three-week lockdown in a move that may prove to be one of the most significant. While it has a comparable population to China, India is much poorer, with a rudimentary public health care system and where half the population does not have access to sanitation. There is widespread illiteracy, which makes educating people about the virus and steps to try to halt it more difficult.And as India is a lively democracy, officials will seek to avoid taking the sort of authoritarian measures China was able\u0026nbspto. In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, huge, dense metropolises of 20 million people, social distancing will be impossible for the bulk of people. Access to testing, and reporting of such figures, is also likely to be a challenge. Ramanan Laxminarayan,\u0026nbspan economist and an epidemiologist,\u0026nbsphas estimated between 300 million\u0026nbspto 500 million Indians were likely to be infected by the end of the summer. Perhaps a tenth of those were likely to be severe. Some have estimated between one to two million people could die. The country currently reports around 2,000 infections and just 68\u0026nbspdeaths.Aware of the challenge facing the population, Modi\u0026nbsphas sought forgiveness for the measures imposed. “I apologise for taking these harsh steps that have caused difficulties in your lives, especially the poor people,” Modi said in a radio address. “I know some of you will be angry with me. But these tough measures were needed to win this battle.”The journey that led the US to occupy this unwanted first place, surging past Italy and China with more than 80,000 cases to have the most Covid-19 infections, will be hashed over for years to come.We already know it started with a failure at the very highest levels to listen to the scientists.Yet America’s failings are not simply those of the president. Rather, they include a for-profit healthcare system made up of many different parts, often working against each other – a point made powerfully by Democratic senator Bernie Sanders.It resulted in inidual states unilaterally taking action\u0026nbspagainst the disease, while others did nothing. As a result, cities such as New York and Seattle enforced a\u0026nbsplockdown, while places like Miami Beach and New Orleans remained open for play.States also found themselves bidding against each other to obtain basic equipment such as ventilators and masks, while being accused of stocking items for spikes governors had identified in their own hotspots.“The government has said they have sent us 4000 ventilators those 4000 ventilators are not currently in use. Why? Because we don’t need them,” stormed Andrew Cuomo of New York. “What we’re doing is we’re planning for that apex, we’re planning for the critical need, and making sure we have the equipment, the staff, the beds for that critical need.”Did arrogance and disbelief play a role? Probably. The US has long seen the oceans that surround it as bulwarks and barriers against threats from overseas. And how could something like this happen to the world’s superpower. This isn’t China. This isn’t Iran. This isn’t even Italy.As the disease has continued to spread, medics have also been testing more people. The latest figure stands at more than 215,000 infections and 5,000 deaths. The president, who claimed businesses would be open by Easter Sunday, now claims that target was simply “aspirational”. The lockdown is to stay in place at least until the end of April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But I went above and beyond with the coronavirus, not just washing my hands  or  times a day until they were red raw but boiling my gloves as well.I took them off first, obviously, and even photographed the act, as I was aware this behaviour was a little “out there”.But, like the committed hypochondriac I am, I figured the ridicule was worth enduring so long as it provided one further line of defence against the invisible enemy which has us all surrounded.The glove thing seemed to be working as well, right up until the time it wasn’t. And, on Sunday, March , I very suddenly became one of those symptom lists you read about.Head in a “vice-like grip”  Check. Whole body feeling like it’s been in a car crash  Yes, and the bag didn’t inflate. Feverish  Oh boy, yes.  Chills  They’re multiplying.There was the cough as well. A textbook dry, intermittent hack that’s had its moments but never really amounted to much and has left me in a grey area, medically speaking.Testing has been out of the question, so to this day I still don’t knowI’ve had coronavirus or just something  horrible. The advice from Jake at  was unequivocal, though — “self-isolation” — and the response from everyone  was almost exactly the same.“Ha ha. Not much dferent for you then.”Ha ha. Indeed not.They mean no harm, bless them. It’s the classic British response to bad medical news. They’re reassuring themselves, as you need to do with this thing.If you think I’ve spent the past fortnight sat monitoring EastEnders for minor continuity errors, though, you haven’t had coronavirus, or anything like it.The thing does not lend itself to watching television as easily as you might think. Especially not during its first week when I was sleeping for anything up to  hours a day.The time you are awake you’re in a lot of discomfort and unwilling to be reminded of your condition, which is what television is now doing incessantly, while trying to take moral ownership of the illness as well.With endless spare time on my hands, I didn’t give up on the medium, though. I thought, in fact, it might be a good opportunity to watch some of those films I’d never got round to watching, like Get Carter, Lost In Translation and The Big Lebowski. It wasn’t.I hated all three of them, especially The Big Lebowski— not because they were without merit but because I had no appetite, zero energy and was unable to stand upright without losing my breath, while watching them.I shall now associate all three movies with misery, pain and paracetamol, for ever. About the same time I gave up on films, Sky’s Football HD channel played an even crueller trick on me, on Monday.Start to finish, it re-ran Scotland’s abortive Euro  campaign. The full chronological nightmare, starting with the - defeat in Kazakhstan, which I’d witnessed first-hand.A bullet to be dodged, surely  Reader, I watched the lot and, must confess, I found it strangely cathartic and quite funny, as well as sad.Because it reminded me of a time when there was a le that stretched so far beyond the walls of my own little home isolation unit.It provided a salutary lesson as well. Television is a fickle, uncaring beast and, with some honourable exceptions, like The Repair Shop, pretty useless at cheering you up in times of personal distress.People, on the other hand, are amazing and came up trumps during my illness.I’ve been particularly blessed with my amazing and generous East London neighbours, Fatima, Richard and David, who became aware, early on, what was happeningand reacted accordingly.Every day the buzzer would go, I’d hear footsteps beating a fairly quick retreat and by the time I’d shuffled my way to the front door, dinner would be sitting by my feet. They phoned regularly as well, to check on me.Until, on Day , after a couple of  dawns , the fever had lted, I’d had my last night-sweat, could think straight again and even a hint of an appetite ed.If this is being done for one miserable, solitary, middle-aged git who boils his gloves, I have not the slightest doubt that even more noble things are being done for all those in far greater need, and humanity will triumph over this illness, with something to spare.In the meantime, my isolation continues for now and —it so pleases the British comedy gods — no, it’s really not much dferent for me.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quite right too.And boy, are they going to need it once they’re in the full glare of the LA-based paparazzi, who operate under far fewer legal restrictions than those based in the UK.One was caught trespassing at the school of a celebrity’s child, another scaled a wall at Jenner Aniston’s to try to get a shot of her, other stars have had their cars blocked by paps, singer Niall Horan was dragged to the floor by one at LAX airport and they’ve been known to sit outside doctor’s surgeries to snap someone famous coming out.So good luck with all that, Harry and Meghan.You’re about to realise how protected you were in the UK, both by the stricter laws and the ring of steel that shields the Royal Family.Little wonder that the rumoured bill for their personal security is estimated at around £million a year.Add in the cost of other staff, general living expenses and the £.million they said they would repay for the refurbishment of Frogmore “cottage” — now sitting empty — and it’s clear they are spending money like water with no discernible means of actually earning much to make up any shortfall.Which, once the Covid- crisis has passed, means they will be vulnerable to the attention of the super-rich.And we all know how that worked out for Prince Andrew.But perhaps the greatest concern for the Duke and Duchess of Sussexis that, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the world’s attention is erted where and the news of their move to LA was greeted with a collective, “so what ”A mass disinterest which, when you’re “former royals for sale”, is very worrying indeed.FORMER Love Island star Maura Higgins has revealed she could get any boy she wanted at school.“I’ve always been very, very confident,” she says.Following her recent appearance on Dancing On Ice, reports that she’d split from boyfriend Curtis Pritchard were followed by rumours that she’d got a little too close to her married skating partner Alex Demetriou.But Maura claims they are “just friends”, adding: “Alex and I are so close – we’ve trained together for months . . . but that’s it.”I’m sure his we, fellow skater Carlotta Edwards, will now feel deeply reassured.Yes, it’s come to this.

Ordinary people going for a walk.A friend of mine was walking her dog in a London park when two rozzers turned up on horseback.They told her not to throw a ball for the dog.Why not  Because it might have Covid- on its fur and bump into someone .Um . . . might not the police horses also have Covid- on their fur And then there’s the Derbyshire coppers sending a drone to harass some bloke out for a walk in the Peak District. Entirely alone, not a danger to anyone.The chief plod of Derbyshire has been defending his force’s actions.Meanwhile, other forces have been naming and shaming the alleged “covidiots” on social media.I don’t think the Old Bill have ever been happier. They’re loving this.I know we must not take unnecessary journeys.I know we need to employ social distancing.People holding house parties and so on is crazy.I think the vast majority of us grasp this.But this is a tricky time. The public needs to be kept onside.We need to be able to respect our police, just as we respect the Government’s advice.Overzealous behaviour by the coppers does not help.Why should a bloke not swig from a can of beer in a park How is that more dangerous than taking your dog for a walk Why is being totally alone in a wilderness area a danger to other people There needs to be some common sense employed.Meanwhile, regarding my Geiger counter, the batteries are included.And for an extra roll of bog paper I’ll throw in the full-colour chart showing the ious symptoms of radiation poisoning.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.THE wildle is just loving this lockdown, though.I’ve never seen so many foxes, badgers and deer out where I live.It’s because people aren’t going out.And I like the thought that the animals are always there, just waiting for us humans to come a cropper.I also enjoyed the patrol of goats which have taken over the Welsh resort of Llandudno.Watch your backs, you goats.MIDDLE CLASS: Sacking the nanny and the cleaner in case they give the virus to Cressida, two, and Wolfgang, four.Growing hydroponic vegetables in the annex, enough for half a salad by next Feb.Writing letters of complaint to the board of Waitrose about the unavailability of dried black limes and manchego.Stockpiling hummus.Cycling round the local park wearing chemical warfare gear.Trying, desperately, to sell their three-bedroom cottage in North East Italy.Washing their hands every  seconds with Duchy Original Organic Fairtrade Hand Sanitiser.Trying to fit a face mask on Corbyn, their Labrador.Removing the back seats from the Range Rover for the next click and collect.Hoping to get a nice postcard from their oldest son, Oliver, who has been on his gap year in Wuhan.WORKING CLASS: Getting p***ed watching Netflix.ONE of the surprising benefactors of this virus has been the BBC.Only a couple of months ago its very existence was in doubt.The Government was planning to decriminalise non-payment of its licence fee.People were sick to the back teeth of its patent political bias.But in general, it’s done very well during this crisis.Some of its news programmes have adapted brilliantly.Not Newsnight, obvs, which is still a jabbering gripefest.But the Radio Four PM programme has been excellent.It’s presenter, Evan Davis, has an affable calmness – and he asks the right questions.Radio Five has adapted well, too – although I’d junk ALL of the sport right now.Butonly the BBC could cover politics with the same lack of bias it is now using to cover the pandemic.I SAW that a bully Builder Who Shot His Partner, Their Two Daughters, Four and Two, Their Pet Dog and Then Himself At Their £, Sussex home was described as “a nasty Piece Of Work” by a Neighbour.Sheesh!

And we’ve only been under lockdown for a week or so.But I’m slightly with Piers Morgan when he says “man up”.My dad was a working-class bloke from the North East of England.He got himself into a grammar school and had a chance to go to university. But the war stopped that.At  he was serving on a motor torpedo boat in the channel.My mum, meanwhile, was evacuated as a kid, taken away from her parents. Then her house was bombed flat.In  the Luftwaffe bombed our cities every night, death raining down.That strikes me as being real hardship.All we’ve been asked to do is sit on the sofa for a while, eating crisps.I think we can probably get through this, you know.THINGS nobody has been talking about, anywhere, since the crisis hit us.This last one is the most interesting.At times like this nobody caresyou’re black, white, brown, gay, transgender, Muslim or Jewish.Everyone grasps that we’re all in this together.If only, once this is over, we could understand that we’re STILL in all this together.And that identity politics simply causes unnecessary isions between us.ONCE this is all over the Chinese have a few questions to answer.Mainly about the degree to which their government has not been honest.Either about the start of the virus, deaths and the rate of infection right now.And what happened to the heroic Chinese doctors who tried to warn the world  At least one has disappeared.China is a devious, totalitarian and hostile country.

And I dont think it was even that hard to persuade Harry.Harry would do anything she wanted even when she was just a USA actress. She then was able to extend her circle thanks to their relationship and bring names like Oprah and Serena Williams to their wedding.He was smitten and star struck over the whole thing. I don’t think she had to twist his arm to move to Hollywood.The shock move to LA has been dubbed Megxit  and has “stunned and horried” members of the Royal Family.They believed that Harry, , and Meghan, , would consider ing to Britain to help the royal family on the national effort to battle to coronavirus outbreak.The growing health crisis, has seen Prince Charles, , test positive for Covid- and The Queen, , and ailing Prince Philip, , put into self-isolation.News of the bombshell move came last week as US entertainment giant Disney pushed ahead with the release of a charity film about elephants, for which Meghan provides the voiceover.The deal is believed to have been done after Harry cornered the company’s boss Bob Iger at the premiere of The Lion King in London last year.But the friend, who became estranged from Meghan several years ago, said she was not surprised the couple speeded up their move to LA instead of ing to the UK to join the royal family.“They wasnt really ever a consideration for her, it’s been obvious from the start,” the LA-based former pal said.“Her relationship to that family seemed to be dependent on her freedom to have a ‘role’ that she felt was big enough for her.“She wanted it her way, and she wanted it quickly – she was never wanted to change the timeline for them.“These stories of security issues, border closure or taxes in Canada are a convenient way of them putting their plan into action.“The timing has also worked out pretty well with the release of her first project,” she added, referring to the Disney+ documentary Elephant.According to the confidante, Meghan will be “very pleased” after persuading Prince Harry to move their lives to her hometown at such breakneck pace.“Anyone who knows her knew this is where it was headed as soon as she saw she wasnt happy with how things were going in the UK,” the source said“Everything is negotiable for her and when things are not in her favor, she is prepared to cut her losses.“Now she is back home, near her mom, her friends and her PR team. She doesnt have to ask for permission from the royal family in how she chooses to live her le and she can acquire income in all sorts of fields.“She is very pleased, I’m sure. In just a couple of years she has made it back as a big fish to the place where she previously hadnt been such a well known face.“Shell be happy to be back in the Soho House atmosphere, taking meetings and reunited with her avocado toasts and runs on the beach.“But I imagine she will keep her circles ever more exclusive, hosting dinners at her house where she can have a controlled environment and enjoying that people will be wanting access to her le.“In LA she can use her royal fame without any constraints of tradition. Her celebrity meter is very high now and there is no better place for it than Hollywood.“She can make sure that the relationships she keeps are really worthwhile.But she thinks the circumstances might work in Harry’s favor and, despite what some people think, he may well enjoy the new lestyle.“I think Harry will like the change of scenery and the kind of attention they will be getting,” said the source.“It will also be easier on him than it was on her first husband. When she was with Trevor , she was very much up and coming and incredibly busy.“She wanted every opportunity for a red carpet, a magazine shoot, a photograph at an event. He had to deal with sharing her with that side of the job.“But now that they are so high profile, at least for now, she won’t be needing to do all that. Harry wont have to deal with that.“And with Archie being so young still, they will probably keep a tight family unit and try to be lowkey.She added: “Her mom will also bring some normality to their le, I would expect.”The Sussexes left the £.million mansion they were borrowing in Vancouver and took a flight out of the city shortly before US President Donald Trump and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau closed the border between their countries.They are due to step down as senior royals on Wednesday.They are also set to announce their new brand and charity on Instagram, The Sun revealed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well bring together the best minds, the best science that this country has to offer and we’ll work with our friends and allies across the world to do so, he promised.This is a war against an invisible illness that all of humanity need to come together to fight against.The Government plans to roll out immunity passports to all people who can prove theyve already had the virus, he confirmed too.The news comes after fury that the UK has been unable to test anywhere near the numbers seen in countries like Germany.Furious staff who want to get back to work are staying off due to fears they may have the bug - with up to one in four staying away from the frontline.Ministers blamed a lack of chemical agents and swabs yesterday.And Mr Hancock stressed too that we have the best scientic labs in the world, but we did not have the scale to ramp them up.This morning just a few cars were lined up for a drive-through testing centre in Chessington, amid confusion and a lack of communication about how staff isolating at home were meant to access a test.More than , NHS staff have been tested so far after Mr Hancock ordered any extra space to be used for them.The Health Secretary sadly admitted that the UK was still seeing number of deaths increase and unfortunately I think that will continue for a few weeks yet.The press conference was Mr Hancocks first outing since he was diagnosed with coronavirus himself, a week ago, and he said he was delighted to be back at work.He started with a heartfelt tribute to Britains hardworking NHS, before insisting he was right to make sure that sick patients got the tests they needed first before rolling out testing across the nation.The response from the NHS so far has been nothing short of heroic, he said.Mr Hancock gave a shout out to all the health and care staff and the hard work they have been doing to save lives - hailing the Clap For Carers which took place last Thursday - backed by The Sun.Tonight will see another round take place across the entire country to applaud the hardworking NHS staff.He added: I think so many of us felt so emotional when that happened last week and the whole country responded like it did.I know its something The Sun has been leading the charge on and I pay tribute to your work in making sure that every single health and social worker across the NHS and across social care and other public servants know they are valued for the work they are doing, sometimes very dangerous work, to tackle this virus.The Health Secretary also used the press conference to call on Premier League footballers to do their bit and take a pay cut during the coronavirus outbreak.The first thing they can do is make a contribution, take a pay cut and play their part, he urged tonight.The PMs spokesman said earlier today: We acknowledge that more needs to be done.We need to be testing more people... and testing more people quickly., UK tests took place in NHS and PHE labs on Tuesday, No said today.Last night the PM said testing would solve the puzzle of coronavirus by allowing people who had the virus or have it currently to get back into action when they can.He admitted for the first time that testing as many people as possible would be the best way to eventually end the lockdown and beat the bug.No said they were still in talks with nine companies about using anti-body tests which will showsomeone had it in the past - but they havent yet passed the required safety tests.Ministers have bought .million of them - subject to them working.Meanwhile, No also suggested that Brits could get a coronavirus immunity certicate to carry around with them in future to allow them to travel freely.We have always said we will watch what other countries are doing and we will always look to learn from ideas which are helpful, they said.[boxout headlineCORONAVIRUS CRISIS - STAY IN THE KNOW introDont miss the latest news andTo follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.[ boxout] Eight Public Health England labs are now working on corona testing - and  from the NHS.A whole new base in Milton Keynes opened last week - and two more are set for Cheshire and Glasgow too.Government sourced machines from nearly  universities and companies to open the new MK lag and not a single institution refused.New swabs have been manufactured too so that manufacturers can pump them out of factories and get them across the country for more tests, too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This follows a previous announcement from the Canadian government that it would be curbing entry to only Canadian citizens, family members, permanent residents, diplomats, and Americans.The economic impact on airlines has been immense. Nearly  per cent of flights impacted by the European travel bans are US-based, such as Delta and United Airlines, with billions in lost revenue already estimated for this year, says the forum.Many airlines worldwide face the threat of bankruptcy in coming months,these declining trends continue. To hedge against these domino effects of the outbreak, US airlines are requesting upwards of billion in bailouts and direct assistance from the government.Covid- is throwing everything up in the air - including the fate of airline companies, it adds.Reuters reported on March  that airlines across the globe are feeling the pain as travel demand withers because of the coronavirus outbreak, scrapping flights and ditching financial forecasts.The global health crisis has brought European air travel to a standstill, leaving airlines with no revenue and facing a struggle for survival.Air France-KLM said on March  it would park its biggest airliners and slash services by up to  per cent. The group said it had identied measures to save  million eurosin  and ways to cut its capital expenditure by  million euros.Air New Zealand said on March  it would cut long-haul capacity by  per cent in the coming months and the domestic network by  per cent in April and May.American Airlines plans to cut  per cent of its international flights through May  and ground nearly all its widebody fleet.Delta is cutting domestic capacity by ten to  per cent, and international by  to  per cent, freezing hiring, offering voluntary leave options to staff and looking at early retirement of older aircraft.In an effort to raise much-needed revenue and keep some planes in the air, Delta and Air New Zealand said they had joined the growing number of carriers offering cargo charters on passenger planes.We are getting some strong interest from customers wanting to ship to and from Shanghai, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Sydney and Melbourne, Air New Zealands GM Cargo Rick Nelson said.Around half the worlds air cargo normally travels inside passenger planes rather than dedicated freighters, so the cancellation of passenger flights has led to a sharp reduction in cargo capacity. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite a serious impact directly.“But thankfully for me I could get through it, and I managed to keep working through it.”His comments come one day on from demanding Premier League stars do their bit over coronavirus and take a pay cut.Several clubs are making staff take massive pay cuts, but refusing to cut the multi-million pound salaries of their players during the crisis.This includes a host of top clubs such as Tottenham, Newcastle, Bournemouth and Norwich.Speaking yesterday, the Health Secretary warned football clubs everyone needs to do their bit in the battle against the virus.He said: That means Premier League footballers too.The first thing they can do is make a contribution, take a pay cut and play their part.He also pledged to test , Brits a day for coronavirus after the shambles of recent days – but it won’t be for weeks to come.As the Health Secretary’s voice croaked after he came back from fighting the virus himself, he revealed a new plan to tackle the deadly bug with a huge ramping up of tests.Another  people were confirmed to have died of Covid- yesterday – taking the UK total to more than ,.His five point plan to get to , tests a day by the end of April included:All NHS staff will be able to have a test by the end of the month, he promised.“That is the goal and I’m determined were going to get there,” Mr Hancock insisted.The NHS states the key coronavirus symptoms to watch for are a new, continuous and dry cough as well as a high temperature.Experts have called for a loss of taste and smell to be recognised on that list, by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, after scientists found  per cent of people with the virus displayed those signs.Other symptoms reported by patients include muscle aches, sore throat, tummy aches and diarrhoea and nasal congestion.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus spread just talking breathing","story":"CORONAVIRUS could be spread just by breathing and talking, doctors are warning. Experts have previously said the deadly bug is transmitted between people through droplets spread from coughing and sneezing.And those droplets can contaminate surfaces or objects and infect people who touch the surface and then touch their faces.However, scientists are now warning that coronavirus may also spread through the air in tiny particles that infected people exhale during normal breathing and speech.Researchers from the US National Academies of Sciencemade the revelation in a report they delivered to the White House on Wednesday.According to CNN, the letter, written by Dr. Harvey Fineberg, a former Hard School of Public Health dean, emphasised that even the breath of a person with coronavirus could be dangerous.He said: While the current [coronavirus] specic research is limited, the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolization of virus from normal breathing.The NAS letter to the White House noted research conducted in a Chinese hospital that found the virus can sent into the air and linger there when health care workers take of their protective gear and possibly as result of cleaning jostling the particles free, or even of movements.If coronavirus is airborne, that could help to explain why it is so contagious, and can spread before people have symptoms.As of yesterday, more than one million people are confirmed to have Covid-, and more than , people have died worldwide.In the UK, there are , cases of coronavirus - and the death toll stands at ,.And over in the US there , confirmed cases and , deaths.Brits are currently advised to stay more than two metres apart from one another to slow the spread of coronavirus, however, Dr Fineberg warned that the virus can spread much further.He said: If you generate an aerosol of the virus with no circulation in a room, its conceivable thatyou walk through later, you could inhale the virus.Butyoure outside, the breeze will likely disperse it.Dr Fineberg and his expert  said that wearing surgical masks can cut down on the amount of virus that infected people spread - citing an unpublished study from the University of Hong Kong.However, their letter does not address whether wearing a mask will protect the person wearing the mask from catching the illness and how much virus a person must breathe in to get infected isn’t known.Dr Fineberg said he himself will begin wearing a mask in public as a precaution against contracting the virus, especially in relatively closed spaces like grocery stores.He added: Im not going to wear a surgical mask, because clinicians need those.But I have a nice western-style bandana I might wear. Or I have a balaclava. I have some pretty nice options.Yesterday it was revealed Brits could soon be ordered to wear a face mask in public after new evidence prompted officials to consider a major U-turn.World Health Organisation advisers examined research that suggests their wider use does help to combat coronavirus.The review may lead the WHO and the UK government to rewrite existing guidelines, which only recommend their use in limited circumstances.Washing your hands with soap and water for at least  seconds and social distancing are still the best way to stop the deadly new virus from spreading.The NHS has until now maintained there is “very little evidence” of their benefit outside of hospital but masks are compulsory in some countries.Prof David Heymann, who chairs the advisory group, said new data from Hong Kong and the USA had led to the review.He said: “There is right now a debate about the usefulness of masks because Hong Kong has provided some evidence that masks may be useful in protecting iniduals from infection.“It’s not clear yet whether or not that’s true.“The WHO, the group that I work with, is debating that with a group of experts from around the world to understand whether there is evidence which would call for a change in what WHO is recommending.”Some experts have warned there is an increased risk of infectionpeople do not use face masks correctly or take care when removing them.Others have said they can protect people from catching the virus and stop infected people from passing it on.The WHO has said people only need to wear masksthey are caring for someone with Covid-, orthey themselves are coughing or sneezing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Announcing the latest Government bailout, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “We have been very clear during the outbreak that the best way to stop the spread of the virus and protect the NHS is to stay at homepossible. “Our buses are a leline for people who need to travel for work or to buy food – including our emergency services and NHS staff – and it’s absolutely vital we do all we can to keep the sector running. “This multimillion-pound investment will protect crucial local transport links across England, bolstering the sector and minimising disruption for passengers in the long term.”  The Bus Services Support Grant will be paid over three months and comes on top of £million already being poured into buses. Some £million which had been earmarked for new services will instead go to councils to maintain existing services – taking the total amount for buses to nearly £million. However, bus services were hammered during a decade of austerity.

Sally Collier, Chief Regulator, Ofqual, said: “We have published a message to students to reassure them that we, and exam boards, will do everything we can to make sure that, as far as possible, grades are fair and that they are not disadvantaged in their progress to sixth form, college, university, apprenticeships, training or work because of these unprecedented conditions.” How will grades be calculated  Teachers will be asked to send exam boards two sets of data: . The grade they believe a student would most likely getteaching, learning and exams had happened as planned. Within each subject, the order of students, by performance, for each grade.This information will be used to standardise grades. Schools are being asked to consider a range of things including classwork and homework, results in assignments and any mock exams, any non-exam assessment or coursework and the studentaposs general progress during the course in order to decide the grade. Schools will be asked to sign to say that the data they are sending is correct. The exam board will then use the two forms of data submitted to decide the grade. Will students be told of their grades in advance  No. This is highly confidential.Teachers are told not to share this under any circumstances.Ofqual say it will avoid school leaders and staff being “put under pressure by students and parents, to submit a grade that is not supported by the evidence”. The grade that students eventually receive may not be the same as the grades the teachers put into the process. When do schools and colleges have to submit this information  The guidance is that it is not earlier than the  May.

But health experts have warned that it may take  days before an immunity test will work and that immunity may not last forever. It came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to ramp up the number of tests - to seepeople currently have the disease - to , a day by the end of April. The government has been on the backfoot over its testing commitments for several days now failing to explain why the UK lags behind its European counterparts - testing just , a day compared to , in Germany. Today Mr Hancock said that the government was looking at an immunity certicate as a way out of the lockdown imposed on the UK in the last two weeks. He told a press conference in Downing Street: How people who have had the disease have got the antibodies and therefore have the immunity can show that and so get back as much as possible to normal le. That is an important thing that we will be doing and are looking at. But the Health Secretary said it was too early in the science of the immunity that comes from having the disease to be clear about when that might come and how it would work. He added: I wish that we could but the reason that we canapost is because the science isnapost yet advanced enough. But we have a programme of work on to understand the immunity that you get out of this, which is a global piece of work. And what you then do for people who have had the disease.  Mr Hancock, who appeared in Downing Street for the first time in a week after self isolating, said: Believe you me I have a very strong, personal interest in this one now that Iaposve been through it. Public Health Englandaposs Director of Health Improvement Professor John Newton agreed that there was still a lot of work to be done to explore how immunity to coronavirus works. He said that getting antibody tests ready was less pressing than testing to seepeople currently have covid- - partly because of the time it takes for antibodies to show up.  He said: The initial priority is for the swab tests, because those are the tests that allow the NHS to manage critically ill patients to the best they possibly can and also to allow NHS staff and other key workers to come back to work when they can. The antibody tests are ideally done  days after an infection, so in fact the requirement for the antibody test isnapost really with us yet. Both types of test are important, both are urgent, but the most urgent is the swab test so we can treat patients better and get staff back to work.  He added: The test measures your immunity and the peak of your immunity is at  days. Soyou want to tell somebody that they havenapost been infected, and theyaposre not immune, you really have to do it then to be sure.  So thataposs the point about  days. Professor Newton also explained that scientists did not yet know how immunity would work. He said that what the test measures is an antibody, so there is some immunity. But the question of whether that is enough to stop you being infected at all, or getting serious disease is something that weaposre going to need to discover as time goes on. I think we have to be optimistic that it will give some immunity, but weaposre just not quite sure how much at the moment.

He ran for the top job never expecting to win and went on to oversee one of the most tumultuous and controversial chapters in his partyaposs history. On the one measure that matters – the winning of power – he failed comprehensively, losing two general elections. Many in the Labour will want to write his time in charge out of the history books. Others will claim he transformed his party and gave Labour back its soul. So how did he fare    If the purpose of a political party is to win power then Labour failed abjectly under Corbyn.Although he surprised his detractors in the general election, Labour was still  seats short of the majority needed to govern.The  election was even worse which saw Corbyn lead his party to its worse result since .The dismal run of form also saw Labour lose  seats in  local elections and  in the  local elections.Party management From the beginning Corbyn struggled to impose his command on the Parliamentary Party.He only scraped on to the ballot paper after MPs loaned him their vote to aposbroaden the debate.apos Few thought he would win. Having been a serial rebel under previous leaders he lacked the authority to whip his own backbenchers into line. In  dozens of frontbenchers resigned prompting an abortive leadership challenge led by Owen Smith. The party membership rallied behind their leader but it left Labour bruised and ided. And the warring continued at a local level as Corbyn supporters tried to deselect MPs who were deemed disloyal to the cause. Anti-semitism  Corbynaposs failure to tackle anti-Semitism is by far the biggest stain on his leadership. Labour became the second party after the BNP to be investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for failing to root out anti-Jewish hate. Apologists for the Labour leader said the number of cases of proven anti-semitism was a fraction of the party membership. But Corbyn was too slow to stamp down on the hatred and abuse by supporters acting in his name. The failure saw Jewish MPs such as Louise Ellman and Luciana Berger driven from the party and the Chief Rabbi warn that Jewish people would not be safeLabour won power under Corbyn. Corbyn is rightly praised for empathy for those who have been hard done by but he often appeared to be out of touch with voters, including many traditional Labour voters, who like the flag, forces and family – they are patriotic, proud of the Armed Forces and fond of the Royals. Fairly or unfairly he was accused early on in his leadership of failing to sing the National Anthem.For many voters the defining moment was his response to the Skripal poisonings when he was initially reluctant to blame the Russians.By the time of the  election his personal approval ratings were the lowest recorded by an opposition leader. Struggled with Brexit  Any Labour leader would have found it dficult to plot a path through the thickets of the Brexit debate. As a lelong Eurosceptic, Corbyn found himself out of step not just with the majority of his MPs but the pro-EU party membership. In trying to keep the party together he ended up with a compromise position that pleased almost no one. In the December  he undermined his credentials as a conviction politician by promising a second referendum while refusing to say which way he would vote. Transformed Labour The Labour Corbyn bequeaths the new leader is very dferent to the one he inherited. The triangulation of the Tony Blair years which saw the party shadow many Tory economic policies was ditched for a more radical, socialist agenda. Corbyn and his supporters campaigned on an ambitious, some would argue too ambitious, manesto that pledged to renationalise swathes of the economy, scrap tuition fees and invest in schools, health and education.Whoever wins the leadership is unlikely to turn back the clock.Built a mass membership party When Corbyn became leader in  Labouraposs membership stood at ,. Five years later and can now boast more than , members – one of the largest political movements in the world. This mass membership has given Labour an army of supporters on the ground and brought in vital funds. Many of those who joined were young people who were energised by Corbynaposs message of change. But it has also caused tensions at a local level with more radical members finding themselves at odds with long-standing supporters from the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown years. Championed the underdog Corbyn won the leadership promising a “gentler, kinder, politics.” While not all his followers lived up to this ideal, the party leader won plaudits for the way he spoke up for those in hardship His citing of real peopleaposs experiences at Prime Ministeraposs Questions was further proof of his wish to do politics dferently. Tory MPs often scoffed when he championed welfare claimants or spoke up for bus travellers but the showed Corbyn had a better grasp of le outside Westminster than many gave him credit for. This was especially the case when he comforted the victims of the Grenfell fire in , showing an empathy Theresa May failed to display.

The next Labour leader will be unveiled by party bosses by email on Saturday after a special conference was scrapped as the coronavirus outbreak worsened. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer is widely tipped to become the th leader of the Labour Party, beating rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Mr Corbyn announced he was quitting after leading the party to its worst election showing since the s in December’s snap general election - leaving the Tories with an -strong majority. The winner of the deputy leadership race to take over from Tom Watson, expected to be shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, will be announced at the same time. Front-runner Mr Starmer thanked his rivals for showing “positivity and unity” as ballots closed in the three-month long contest. In a video message to his supporters, he said: “It’s been a long campaign and it’s ending in circumstances that none of us could have predicted”. He added that the race had demonstrated “to our party, to our movement and hopefully to the country that real good can come out of this election”. The latest survey from pollsters YouGov showed that Mr Starmer had a commanding lead over his rivals and could win on first preference votes among more than , members, affiliates and supporters.  Among those casting their votes were , new members who had joined since Labour’s catastrophic general election defeat. The new Labour leader would then immediately turn all the Opposition’s energy on helping tackle the coronavirus crisis. His supporters hope that his serious and forensic style will help hold the Government to account. But allies have ruled out him joining a national unity government - suggesting that Boris Johnson would only offerhe wanted to pin some of the fall-out from the coronavirus crisis onto Labour. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, who has been Labour’s key voice during the pandemic, would be expected to be kept in post.  If Mr Starmer wins the contest he is likely to unveil his shadow cabinet team this weekend. Shadow policing minister Lou Haigh is tipped for a top job, along with Treasury frontbencher Annaliese Dodds and Oldham MP Jim McMahon, who are understood to have impressed the frontrunner. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true\" The campaign saw shadow business secretary Ms Long-Bailey branded the “continuity Corbyn” candidate.

The Health Secretary had a relatively mild case of Covid- - but said he still struggled to sleep and could not eat or drink for a couple of days. Mr Hancock ed to the daily Downing Street press conference yesterday after seven days in self-isolation. He told BBC Breakfast: It was a pretty unpleasant experience. “I went downhill on Thursday last week and for a couple of nights it was very hard to sleep”. Mr Hancock had “a bit of a cough” but not a serious one. However, he had an “incredibly painful throat - it was like having glass in my throat. I couldn’t eat or drink anything for a couple of days.” He added: “When you’re on the way down it’s really worrying because we can all see just how serious this illness is. “I found it really worrying… thankfully it bottomed out and I started getting better.” He added: “I’ve lost half a stone. It’s quite a serious impact directly. “But thankfully for me I could get through it, and I managed to keep working through it. But it’s obviously much harder when you’re both working from home and not very well.”  Boris Johnson was due to come out of self-isolation today, seven days after he came down with symptoms.But the Prime Minister could be forced to stay isolated in the Downing Street flat for longer, after he continued to show mild symptoms that hadnapost abated yesterday.  Mr Hancock insisted he felt entirely better. It came as the Health Secretary faced scrutiny over his pledge to ramp up testing for Covid- to , a day by the end of April. In the small print of his announcement, he admitted the , includes both antigen tests - which showyou currently have the virus - and antibody tests.  Antibody tests showyouaposve had the virus in the past and might be immune. Theyaposre useful, but havenapost been approved yet may only work  days or more after infection and arenapost as immediately needed. The previous target of , tests a day was just antigen tests. Mr Hancock cast more doubt on the programme today when he admitted he couldnapost guarantee he would get to , tests a day by the end of April.

But he faces a challenge not shared by any of his predecessors since Clement Attlee in the s.  The winner will have to rebuild a movement shattered by a historic election defeat which left Boris Johnson’s Tories with an -seat majority.  Alongside his focus on party unity will be a bigger priority: proving to voters that Labour can be trusted to run the country again.   But even that will have to wait.  With the coronavirus crisis gripping Britain, Starmer -he beats rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy - will have to navigate his way through the weeks and months ahead. While the leadership contest has rumbled on, a partial void has opened up where the Opposition should be.  The new Labour chief must offer serious and forensic opposition to a Government that is struggling both to protect the NHS frontline and the most economically vulnerable.  But he must tread carefully between holding ministers to account and being seen to play politics with the biggest crisis facing Britain in a generation.  If he manages to do that he will have cemented himself in the public mind as a credible and caring alternative to the Tory administration.  It is years until the next election, so he has time on his side.  Internally, the new leader must sharpen up the party - clearing out some of the old guard and dramatically professionalising the operation.  He must deliver on his promises to the Jewish community with tough and decisive action to show that Labour will no longer tolerate anti-Semitism within its ranks.  But his biggest challenge will be whether he can genuinely bring his bitterly ided party together, persuading the Corbyn disciples and those who hanker after the Blair and Brown years to put their dferences aside. Many on both sides fear he can’t - and believe he will ultimately end up opting for one side or the other.  At the same time, the new leader must look outwards and show the country that Labour is ready for power.  Thousands of Labour voters lost trust in the party at the last election - over Brexit, the scale of its manesto, patriotism and - crucially - over Corbyn himself.  It will be a hard task to win that back. Starmer already knows that he needs to listen to voters - not just in the Northern heartlands but across the South, Scotland and the rest of the country too.  "},{"url":null,"title":"zoom whatsapp facebook live lockdown","story":"AdvertorialBest ways people are using Zoom, Whatsapp and Skype video chats while on lockdownPeople are getting creative to keep in touch and charities - including these examples supported by The Health Lottery - are full of ideasShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR Advertorial\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Video chats on s such as Zoom, Whatsapp, Skype and Facebook Live have never been so popular as we all look to connect while stuck indoors. Thousands of fantastic charities across Britain act as hubs for their communities throughout the year to build connections and stay in touch. So now many of them are going online to continue their vital work keeping the most vulnerable people in society connected. Funds raised through The Health Lottery have long been used to help some of those most at risk from the virus right now. Here we look at four wonderful charities who come up with fun and innovative new ideas to support people... Skype comedy classes  Headspace Bolton provides stand-up comedy training sessions led by comedy professionals for people affected by mental health issues. The project aims to use humour to reduce the stigma and discrimination towards people with mental ill-health and improve opportunities for employment in the arts sector. To get around the self-isolation rules, the group are using Skype to run online podcasting, scriptwriting and comedy writing courses for members. English lessons over Whatsapp  English for Action London is a project that provides free English lessons to adult migrants who live in in Tower Hamlets . Due to COVID-, the group are experimenting with teaching via Skype and Whatsapp and are encouraging educators to share notes and teaching guides. Project members have also started calling round the students to check in with them and dropping groceries off to people who are self-isolating. Facebook Live choir sessions - with , people watching  The Rogues Shanty Chorus, from the Voice cLoud, is a local charity which aims to encourage interest in Suffolk’s unique coastal, cultural and musical heritage by exploring folk music and its associated traditions created by fishing communities. The project holds music sessions for parents of children in their early years, extra-curricular music workshops for young people, and a choir for local people. Although unable to meet as many of their members are within the vulnerable criteria, the group were determined that those who viewed the choir as a leline, wouldn’t go without. So theyaposve been hosting singalongs over Facebook live, with over  people watching. aposShed Happensapos show for aposSheddersapos  Men and women of all ages can access the Men’s Shed and She-Shed projects which involve bringing people together for a range of activities that involve conversation, craft and mutual support as well as more unusual activities such as wood turning, use of power equipment, novel crafts and outward community engagement . Staithes Shed had to close on th March but members have been keeping in touch via live video chats and some have even made their sheds available to help the community in any safe way, including erecting a cover at a surgery to protect those collecting prescriptions through a side window. Project Co-Ordinator Graham Storer said: The essence of Sheds is not what is made or done. It is the comradeship and family feel.

Pictures across the UK shows piles of waste dumped on roadsides, lanes parks and fields following the closure of waste centres. Quarantined families are producing far higher levels of waste following clear outs and plenty of leftover food leading to councils across the country struggling to keep on top of disposal. Mounds of unwanted clothing and knick-knacks are also being left outside charity shops that may not re-open for months. Have you got a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror Only a few tips remain open but those that are operating are running with only a handful of skeleton staff. And while some people are struggling to know what to do with all the extra food waste, others have jumped on the opportunity to off load unwanted items across both rural and urban areas. Recycling centres are also largely shut for the time being and kerbside collections scaled back in many places. Photos have emerged showing the disgusting state of the problem, with rubbish piled up on roadsides, in parks and on fields, with local authorities unable to keep up. Council officials have said many people are initially looking to do the right thing by taking their rubbish to recycling centres, but on discovering them closed are dumping the waste instead. One council says the amount of waste dumped in that way has gone up three fold. West Oxfordshire District Council is pleading with residents to be more mindful with waste teams working round the clock - potentially putting themselves at risk of virus infection. They say recycling areas are having to be cleared every day by the councilaposs waste team. Cllr Norman MacRae, cabinet member for the environment, said: While we have some sympathy with residents who may have quantities of waste building up, we must emphasise that for everyoneaposs safety please refrain from dumping it in public spaces.  This places an unnecessary additional workload on our cleaning teams and is not acceptable at any time let alone the current coronavirus situation. I would further advise that these sites are not for the disposal of commercial items, they are for household recycling materials. I would remind offenders that we are monitoring the situation closely. The law has not changed and anyone caught fly-tipping will face prosecution and a large fine. A spokesman for the council said: We have not calculated the exact tonnage data as yet but we can say we have seen a threefold increase in items at key sites which is forcing us to carry out additional collections with a dedicated crew and truck.  Itaposs a mixture of items. I canapost speak for other councils but I am sure the situation is being replicated across Oxon following the closure of the household recycling centres. Councillors in Lancashire branded fly-tippers disgusting for taking advantage of the coronavirus outbreak to dump rubbish. Cllr Ray Davies, the Darwen East Liberal Democrat, said: We are in a situation where we are advised to isolate but, in some areas, they are taking advantage and simply fly tipping and not making full use of the bins. People are simply throwing bags and furniture into the back alleys and saying nothing to do with me. This is appalling. We need to be cleaner and more hygienic but here we have thoughtless residents taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic and dumping rubbish in back alleys while the borough council staff are busy with other issues to do with the Covid- outbreak.  We are in isolation because of dirty habits, this must be a warning to all of us that we cannot keep doing this and must work together for the sake of future generations and the planet. We must help the council and take responsibility for our actions or we will be in isolation for a much longer time. Newton Street and Perry Street were cleaned by myself over the last six weeks with a lot of help from the council, but here we are again a short time later with dumping and fly-tipping all through the back streets. Alley-ways in Stoke-on-Trent are also strewn with household waste, including uneaten food and fridges. Monienne Stone, secretary of Fenton Events Board, said: Fly-tipping has been an ongoing problem in many areas of Fenton. Itaposs an urgent public health issue. People need to understand that itaposs not OK to dump litter as it endangers all our health. Thereaposs also the cost to the taxpayer to clear it up.  In Greater Manchester where recycling centres have also closed and there are fewer council workers to collect waste, fly-tipping is also on the rise. Heaps of bin bags, household furniture items and cardboard boxes are piled on streets in Collyhurst, Chadderton and Saddleworth. In a scenic spot on Brighton Road in Saddleworth, a mouldy mattress was dumped on a grass verge. Manchester City Councilaposs Executive Member for Neighbourhoods, Councillor Rabnawaz Akbar, said: Further to a fly-tipping incident on Sand Street, Collyhurst, we are currently looking into evidence provided to us by a local resident and will do everything in our power to secure the culpritaposs conviction. While this investigation is carried out, the dumped waste will also be cleared. At a time when we should all be pulling together, it is disgraceful that anybody still thinks that it is OK to fly-tip in our neighbourhoods. We will continue our enforcement efforts on behalf of Manchester residents and prosecute offenders whenever the evidence allows.  Waste is also piling up on Scottish roads, where a cooker and mattresses were abandoned at a recycling centre in Fe and rubbish spills across a grassy verge at a rural beauty spot. Selfish fly-tippers are ignoring government guidance against non-essential travel leading Fe Council to slam residentsapos irresponsible behaviour. Dawn Jamieson, safer communities team manager, said: Fly tipping is an issue. I think itaposs probably been highlighted a bit more over the past couple of weeks. What weaposve been trying to do is make people a bit more responsible. Because centres have been closed people will be thinking itaposs acceptable to be putting their rubbish and thataposs not the message weaposre trying to get across. There really isnapost an excuse at all - people are very irresponsible. With everything  going on at the moment, how people are finding the time to go out and go against the governmentaposs advice to make unnecessary journeys and dump rubbish is beyond me.  Ken Gourlay, head of assets and transportation and environment at Fe Council, said: Unfortunately, in these challenging times when council services are already under additional pressure, the misuse of recycling points and fly tipping are issues. Everyone is responsible for their own waste and must dispose of their rubbish responsibly. Recycling points are still available at supermarkets and shopping centres, but residents are requested not to make special visits to them, in line with government guidance, but to use them while doing their essential shopping. If your supermarket has recycling facilities and you are travelling there anyway, please dispose of your recycling responsibly. Waste and recycling should not be placed beside the bins at recycling points or communal bins.  We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, but we ask that everyone follows the governmentaposs strict instructions at this time and not make any non-essential journeys and undertake non-essential activities. We are working hard to ensure that we continue to pick up domestic bins from the kerb, so that thereaposs no need to travel. We ask that only bins that need emptied - more than half full - are put out for collection to help relieve pressure on our reduced collection teams. With the closure of the household waste and recycling centres, and the suspension of the bulky uplt service, residents should ensure that large items intended for disposal are stored safely away from communal areas.

Madie, nine, and four-year-old Josh showed off the honour that was sent to parents Drew Lee and Emma Thomas from the Guinness World Records. Hope died in November  shortly after she was born and her kidneys and liver cells were donated. Drew, , said of the certicates the family received: “I actually burst into tears when I opened the letter. “It was quite an emotional moment, to me this has finalised something. “Even though Hope only lived for  minutes she is still making her mark on the world. She will never be forgotten. After I’m gone someone will look at these books and read her name.”  Emma, , added: “Receiving the letter was a bit of a shock and opening it brought tears to my eyes.” The certicates read: “The youngest organ donor is Hope Lee, of Newmarket, UK, who donated her kidneys and liver cells just  minutes after she was born on  November .” Drew and Emma found out in the early stages of pregnancy Hope had the brain condition anencephaly and would not survive. But they refused to abort her after being inspired by the story of another tiny donor. Teddy Houlston lived for just  minutes before he donated his organs in . Hope’s kidneys were given to a woman in her late s.  Despite being as small as hazelnuts, the organs grew rapidly and are now of an adult size. Josh is also going from strength to strength. Drew said: “He’s a lovely little boy, very caring and loving, he’s just so adorable. “He knows he had a little sister and can recognise her photo. He’s taken finding out about Hope really well.” Drew and Emma have always spoken in support of the Mirror’s successful campaign for the ­introduction of Max and Kiera’s Law. The couple understand a doctor from Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, who was involved with their daughter, submitted her name for the record.  Drew said: “Hope is part of history now and has left her mark on the world. In many ways we are still grieving but the world record certicates are another step towards closure.” The couple have since split. Emma still lives in Newmarket and Drew at nearby Mildenhall. Max and Keira’s Law is named after a boy who received a heart ­transplant and the girl who donated it to him. Keira Ball, from Devon, was only nine when she died in a car accident. Her dad agreed for her organs to be donated and she saved four lives, including that of Max Johnson, of ­Winsford, Cheshire. The nine-year-old had been kept alive with a mechanical pump and would have died without the transplant.

WHO had warned ministers, as well as Public Health, Cabinet and Department of Health officials that community testing could slow the spread of the virus.“That may have been a mistake,” Professor Graham Medley, chairman of SPI-M, official government advisers for infectious diseases, told The .The admissions by Whitehall officials that mass testing did not figure in discussions comes as ministers are now facing questions on the effectiveness of defences used in the pandemic. The likes of Germany and South Korea have been able to test hundreds of thousands of their citizens quickly in contrast to Britain which is still struggling to keep up. PHE has been slammed for failing to set up laboratories across the UK meaning frontline NHS staff canapost get virus tests. One official said on Thursday it was down to the health agencyaposs complete control freakery which led to the failure. While Prof Medley said government modellers were unable to keep track of the virusapos spread, as a result. “The current problem is based upon the fact that we didn’t invest in preparedness before all this happened, he admitted.  The professor said because so much focus was put on the flu - which doesnapost require mass testing - the government was ill prepared, with PHE central to the whole thing. He said flu pandemics are a regular occurrence but other viruses like HIV, SARS, Mers and Ebola all had the potential at one time to become major outbreaks. “In hindsight I would have brought in  more laboratory roles in October. He went on to say the issue was the government being reluctant to invest millions of pounds in something unless it was in front of them at the time. Prof Medley said testing is crucial to get a grip on the situation while the best data we currently have is from how many people have been hospitalised and how many have died. However, he admitted UK officials have been well aware of how prepared South Koreaaposs mass public testing programmes are following the Sars epidemic in . Even so, the UK government’s preparations also appear to conflict with official guidance on bird flu issued to countries by the World Health Organisation. The WHO had advised countries to prepare mass testing in  in response to bird flu though these were also ignored in Britain. Thehas previously reported how the government kept the terrying results of a secret outbreak test in  under wraps. Exercise Cygnus found Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a severe outbreak due to critical bed shortages, morgue capacity and PPE - but as a result mass testing was still not deemed necessary. The source said next time the government would take a dferent approach in relation to mass testing. But claimed PHE and ministers should have reached out and got this thing going earlier once other countries began their own testing programmes.

I queued for ages because it is so busy. “I had to leave all the shopping and go to Asda. That’s about half an hour walk away. I had to go to Asda and start again.” Schools across the UK have been forced to shut their doors following the nationwide lockdown and children who were due free school meals have been forced to find other ways to get them. The available options include vouchers, bank transfers and “grab and go” packed lunches distributed from “hub” schools. Although the letter says the vouchers are redeemable at either Tesco or Asda, the council later claried that parents had to check which voucher they had been issued. Lisa said she took the voucher and the letter from Vale of Glamorgan council with her to the Tesco store on Port Road, Barry, but voucher in lieu of payment was refused at the till. Lisa said her son Luke, who has just finished year six at Holton Primary in Barry, had been getting a cold packed lunch delivered to the house since the schools shut. “It was brilliant, they dropped it off, no problem, then yesterday nothing was delivered and then we got the letter and voucher today.” Her partner Anthony Cahill said: We received a letter this morning saying we’d get £ and saying we could spend the voucher at Tesco or Asda. We didn’t know anything about it until we had the letter.”  A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesman said that although the letter clearly says the vouchers can be used at Tesco or Asda, this is not true and parents have to check whether they have been given a Tesco or an Asda voucher. “The council is not aware of the detail of this case, but the vouchers are specically for use in either Tesco or Asda as they are issued by one of these supermarkets. “The recipient cannot choose which outlet they would prefer to shop in. This fact is indicated in the correspondence sent to parents and on the vouchers themselves.” He said the parent carer of every child entitled to a free school meal will now receive a voucher to the value of £ a fortnight - the equivalent of £. a day. “The council is working with Tesco and Asda and is issuing vouchers which can be redeemed at each retailer’s respective shops. We are continuing to investigate how this offer could be extended to include additional retailers.

Many are wondering when le will get back to normal, and when the lockdown will be lted. When will schools in the UK reopen  Boris Johnson said that schools in the UK would remain closed until further notice. While there was some speculation that they would reopen after the Easter holidays, this now seems unlikely.  Experts have suggested that it could be anywhere from three weeks to six months before the lockdown ends. While the government has not given any indication as to when schools will reopen, the furlough scheme will last for  weeks and vulnerable people have been urged to self-isolate for  weeks. Whataposs happening with exams  All exams - including GCSEs and A-Levels - have been cancelled this year. The governmentaposs office of qualications and examinationsis working with exam boards to establish a process that works out a grade for students. This is expected to take into consideration a wide range of evidence, including predicted grades, mock exam results, and non-exam assessment. The process will be standardised across the country, so all students will have their grades worked out in the same way.

Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir said a warm conveyor belt of air bringing very high temperatures will arrive on Sunday - meaning the UK could be hotter than Greece and Portugal.But that welcome warmth will be fighting it out with some strong winds while there could even be gales in the west, said the meteorologist. Wind gusts of at least mph will be ever present across Britain, with Tiree in Scotland seeing the worst of it with gales hitting mph. And even right into the south of England, on the west coast, the breeze is expected to be in and around . It means some areas where temperatures are due to soar well into the teens will feel like single digits, while those in with a chance of hitting  like London only feeling about C. Ms Nasir said following a frosty Thursday night with further showers, Friday will be a chilly day for most Britons. Wherever you are itaposs a chilly start to Friday morning with some sunshine and further showers, she continued. These showers mostly across the north west of England, Wales, Northern Ireland, western parts of Scotland. Further wintry showers across the far north but they will become scattered further in the afternoon and temperatures generally below average for this time of year. As a result, the Environment Agency has put  weather alerts in place across the south of England for today.Ms Nasir went on to say the bonus for Friday is weaposve lost that wind which saw gales of up to mph on Thursday and a yellow weather warning in Scotland.

For the past few days ministers have appeared deaf to the growing clamour for NHS staff and other frontline workers to get these essential tests. Health Secretary Matt Hancock at least showed he has been listening. “I get it,” he said. Which begs the question why it took so long to get the message through. The Government has set a goal of delivering , tests a day by the end of the month. This is a marked escalation from , a day. Everyone will hope Mr Hancock delivers on his promise. Only through testing can NHS staff knowthey are safe toto work and only through testing can we judge when it will be safe to lt the lockdown restrictions. The Government says it has been prevented from taking faster action because of a lack of diagnostic expertise and a shortage of swabs and chemical reagents. This is undeniably true but it does not let them off the hook as to why they did not take steps sooner to prepare for a pandemic that could be seen on the horizon in mid January.  The public has a right to be cynical about the Government’s ability to meet its ambitious target. Just two weeks ago the Prime Minister was talking about , tests a day. At the moment just , NHS staff have been checked yet the Health Secretary has vowed that all , frontline health workers will get tested before the end of the month. These are bold words which will require bold action. Should he fail the cost will not be his job but lives lost.

During and after the aposdateapos theyaposre asked to describe what they think of the other person. If the couple prove to be a good match, Rance and Thi reveal their faces on the Instagram page - and the couple can continue to see where things go.

The cityaposs most famous beach, Bondi, has already been closed after people ignored the guidelines and refused to stay away. Now the areaaposs northern beaches are being used, asit is any other day. In one shocking example, crowds gathered at Fairy Bower pool, after an adolescent Great White Shark was found in Manly. Pet Care business owner Emma Hicks went to the beach after receiving a text from a friend telling her a shark had been found and rescued and taken to the pool area. I arrived to huge crowds surrounding the pool and several staff from the local Sea Le Sanctuary keeping the shark safe and monitoring it. It was later released after one or two days in special care and being assessed as OK to go back to the ocean. In New South Wales leaving your home for anything other than  reasonable excuses including going to work and picking up food shopping, will see you facing either an £, fine or six months in prison. Police Commissioner for News South Wales Mick Fuller said people were still struggling to understand what constitutes exercise.  At a press conference on Thursday, he said: In terms of the new isolation powers, certainly lots of questions about exercise. I don’t get it. He said the government wanted people to keep fit and exercising. “But of courseI said that it’s okay to sit on a park bench, then everyone is going to go to the park. We’re going to end up where we started.

He said: “Every time a police officer stops someone to ask a question you get this very innate skill of working out whether people are telling you the truth or not. “If someone says, ‘look I’m going to the chemist’ andthe chemist is over there and visible then that’s fine, we’re not a police state.

Australiaaposs chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the actual total could be ten times higher than the reported number of confirmed cases. Without criticising any countries, Mr Murphy said he had doubts about some of the data produced by governments, adding: The only numbers I have total faith in are the Australian numbers, frankly. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. He added: Worldwide we have passed one million infections. But we believe the true number is five or  times as much. The world surpassed the one million mark on Thursday evening as infections soared in many countries, including Britain, the US, Spain and Italy. More than , people have died. The UKaposs death toll stood at almost , on Thursday with just under , confirmed infections.  The US has the most confirmed cases , followed by Italy , Spain , Germanyand China . Britain has vowed to increase its tests to , a day by the end of April. This week it carried out , tests in a single day for the first time during the pandemic. However, there are doubts over whether the goal of testing , people a day by the monthaposs end is achievable.  Askedhe can guarantee , tests a day will happen by the end of April, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast: Yes, itaposs got to happen. He added: Iaposve got a plan to get us there. Iaposve set it as a goal. It absolutely is what the nation needs. He said there is still a huge amount of work to do to get to that point. He said: One of the things I tried to do yesterday was set out just some of the real-world challenges that there are. The global coronavirus pandemic is not just affecting people’s physical health. The anxiety, stress and uncertainty of it – and the sweeping changes we’re having to make to our lestyles – are also having an impact on people’s mental health too. If it’s making you feel that way, then you’re not alone. It’s quite normal to feel this way in such a dficult and unpredictable situation. Here are some tips and strategies recommended by our BACP members to help you cope with the mental health impacts of the current global situation. Keep a routine Many people are working from home for the first time in their lives, and some will now be juggling a full-time job and home-schooling their children. Plus, there are people whose usual activities have been curtailed by self-isolation. Our member Vasia Toxavidi says keeping a routine can be really important. “Without a routine, negative thinking and anxiety can escalate. I would suggest that people create a day to day plan of things they will need to do e.g. create a morning exercise programme, work from homepossible, cook something dferent, get into an online course.” Think about restricting access to news media and social media Many of our members recommend having a think about how and when you access the news or social media. This may involve choosing news sources you trust – and avoiding social media channels filled with speculation. Stick to the official government guidance and NHS advice websites. Or limit your access to the news to a certain time of the day. “Some people can be quite paralysed by this anxiety and may want to completely stop interacting with the news,” says Elizabeth Turp.  Keep connected with friends and family In our new world of self-isolation and social distancing, we can’t meet up with family and friends like we used to. But keeping connected to them is vital. Melani Halacre recommends “connecting online with friends and talking about other stuff, inventing new fun ways to connect. An online pub quiz among friends...learn a dance routine at home then share it  Play games online  Cook the same recipe in your own home whilst online ” Be present Emma Brand recommends ‘being present.’ “Take a breath and really experience where you are and how you are feeling. To take in your surroundings and thank the space environment and people in your space - to actively be grateful is very powerful,” she says. Practise gratitude Hansa Pankhania also recommends being grateful for what you have, instead of what you do not. And Natasha Page recommends keeping a gratitude diary, where you write down three things you are grateful for every day. She adds: These can be small things such as the sun shining, hearing your child laugh, a home-cooked meal, a cosy bed. Think about what are the things you do have and are grateful for. Try some breathing and relaxation techniques Take a five-second breath in through the nose, hold that breath for five seconds and then breathe out for five seconds. Do this five times, says Catherine Gallacher. Melani Halacre recommends the STAR technique. “Smile, take aand relax...breathing out longer than in to override fight and flight mechanism,” she says. Cate Campbell also recommends trying mindfulness or relaxation apps, and practising deep breathing. Write down your anxieties, and let them go It can help to express this anxiety in a way that you can control. That could be writing down what you feel, or keeping a journal. “Acknowledge that you feel this way. Don’t ignore these feelings,” says Elizabeth Turp. “Allow yourself to worry, put it down in writing in a notebook, and then put that away. Let it go.” Get access to natural light Lockdown may have limited your trips to parks and for countryside walks, but itaposs still important to get access to natural light, says Rakhi Chand. Our exposure to natural light is limited at the moment, and this affects our serotonin and melatonin levels - both vital for our mental health. Rakhi recommends sitting near windows and making home environments as light and airy as possible. If youaposre lucky enough to have a a balcony or garden, use it regularly.  She also says that certain foods - such as walnuts, almonds or bananas - can help boost melatonin, and salmon, eggs and spinach are among the foods that can help boost serotonin. She also says itaposs worth looking into Vitamin D supplements, a light therapy lamp and limiting blue light from phones or screens as it disrupts circadian rhythm. Look after your wellbeing Make sure you are looking after yourself, doing what you can to help get a good night’s sleep, eating well and doing exercise, adds Catherine Gallacher. “I always talk to my clients about a wellbeing check. Sleeping, eating, exercising. If we manage our health like this, it can help make us more robust against anxiety.” Running either on the spot, or outside, releases endorphins and fools the brain and body that they’ve run away from the danger, says Cate Campbell. Use all your senses One of the self-care tips recommended by Eve Menezes Cunningham is to use all your senses to notice where you are. You might want to notice five things you can see right now, five things you can hear right now, says Eve, or any smells or tastes. “These can help us resist the well-worn neural pathways around catastrophising and feeling helpless.” There are more of Eve’s self-care tips available to read here. No expectations, no pressure Sarah Wheatley, who specialises in helping new parents, says that she often discusses with her clients, how “when we live in extraordinary times, all bets are off.” “Since expectations can be one of the things that are dficult to manage as a new parent, when there are no expectations it can be really freeing and allow people time to find their way without any pressure. “The pressure to get back into shape, the pressure to socialise, the pressure to feed certain ways, the pressure to feel calm and relaxed, the pressure to look as though you have it ‘all together’. These pressures are reduced by physical isolation, and can be helpful to some mothers.” Positive thinking At times, this may feel very dficult to do depending on your personal situation. But re-framing a negative situation into a positive one can be very helpful. Indira Chima says: “I believe there are a lot of positives to be gained, which might not be apparent right now. It forces people to slow down and breathe and take stock and that is always a good thing.   “We live at such a fast, frenetic pace and sometimes donapost stop to think about what itaposs all about and where we are heading.  This is forcing us to do that.  And we will grow as a result of this.” Ask for support “It’s not a sign of weakness, but strength to reach out and ask for support,” says Hansa Pankhania “Make a list of everyone you know, friends, family, colleagues, neighbours etc. Now tick  people from this list, who can provide practical, psychological and moral support.  Connect with them and sustain this support circle.” If you would like support from a qualied professional, many counsellors offer online or telephone counselling. They can help you explore and understand what youaposre feeling.

For loads of other stuff you can get advice, going on bad runs, good runs, heavy defeats, good times.“My first year has been a challenge.

is not surprised his former ayr united teammates are shining for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can go to these other clubs and really perform.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/DNic_Whorterbank_Signs-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"whorter bout this then residents of dundee

In a memorable final, Wolves triumphed - after extra-time, with Shewan’s late own goal handing them the trophy.However, this did not taint his enjoyment of the tournament.He said: “We were in America for six weeks and that was the highlight of my Aberdeen career, even though we lost the final.“As we were in the States there was no close season, but that suited me as it meant I was fit all the way through.“We won our section and Wolverhampton won their’s so there was a play-off.“It was a fantastic occasion except for one thing – I scored the winner, but it was an own goal.”Prior to the adventure across the Atlantic, the Dons faced Celtic, who would go on to be European Cup winners, in the Scottish Cup final at Hampden.He said: “There were , at Hampden for that final, which was a tremendous amount.“Unfortunately we didn’t win the Scottish Cup.”Shewan left Aberdeen in  to start a new footballing career in Australia.On his , he enjoyed a successful career in the Highland League.He said: “When I joined Aberdeen for a start it was £ a week and then went up to £ plus bonuses by the time I left.“The game has changed so much now as players are on thousands per week.”He was inducted into the Aberdeen Hall of Fame and keeps close tabs on his former club.The Dons face an uncertain period due to the coronavirus crisis with chairman Dave Cormack warning of a £ million financial black holethe shutdown continues into July, as expected.Shewan believes Cormack can lead the Dons through these troubled and uncertain times.He said: “Cormack will be a good chairman and will help.“He has run his business well in America.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus claims 16 more lives in scotland","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe number of people in Scotland who have died from COVID- has risen to , the First Minister has announced.The coronavirus death toll rose by  on yesterday with confirmed cases now up to , from , yesterday.A total of  people are in intensive care as the virus accelerates, she said, although numbers are regarded as underestimate.In addition, she confirmed today that the popular Edinburgh Fringe Festival would not take place this summer, bringing to an end rumours it may happen on a much smaller scale.Addressing questions about the availability of ventilators in Scotland, Mrs Sturgeon said the Scottish Government #had a number# on order with overseas manufacturers.#Those orders will be delivered,they stay on track, over the period of the next number of weeks and by the summer,# she said.#It will take us to roundabout more than a thousand ventilators.

All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"never-andrew-neil-needed-now","story":"If, for example, you ever had a hankering to be a housewe in the Soviet Union and queue for essential foodstuffs, then why not pop down to your local supermarket and join the line  Wearing of headscarves and knee socks optional.Fancy feeling like a character in a zombie horror movie  Easy.

Its Britain this and Britain that, and we are one big happy family living in a Dadrsquos Army world.That was the script for the first week of lockdown, anyway.

The first PMQs and FMQs as the extent of the emergency emerged were models of restraint, civility and supportiveness.In journalism too, as in society at large, there was an instinctive reluctance to point fingers. Given the enormity of what has happened, and the rate at which the pandemic has unfolded, many have been, again understandably, stunned into quietude and acquiescence. Surrounded by so much suffering and loss it seemed almost trivial, unhelpful even, to fret over details. Everyone was trying their best in a situation none of us had experienced before.We knew this already from the experience of South Korea and Singapore. We know, too, that testing is vital in getting self-isolating NHS staff back to workthey have had the all-clear.: Edinburgh festivals cancelledBut here we are, some  days later ndash a relative eternity in terms of this virus ndash and governments in London and Edinburgh are failing to hit their targets on testing. There were supposed to be , people tested a day, building to ,. Even this was pathetically low compared to Germany, which can carry out three times that. Yet the UK cannot even hit the lower mark. On Monday,  people were tested. There are not enough kits and labs to ramp up testing to the level required. This is not the first time that reality has failed to match government promises. Remember the antibody test that would tell peoplethey had had the virus and were now most likely immune  The one described by Boris Johnson on March  as a ldquogame-changer  The Prime Minister said trials could start within a month. Weeks on, how close are we to a roll out of these tests Then there is the great Personal Protective Equipmentmystery. Every day a Minister or health official stands at a podium in Downing Street and reels out the statistics on how many masks are available, how many aprons. Millions and millions we are told.Yet also every day, NHS and social care staff are reporting that they do not have the equipment that gives them a fighting chance of staying safe and well. It is scandalous in a supposedly advanced, wealthy society that NHS doctors have to set up a crowdfunding site to buy essential items. Well done and god bless the likes of Scots actor James McAvoy who donated pound, to the campaign, but it should not be necessary in the first place.: Warning on small firmsOn all these matters, and more, governments must be held to account. With Westminster and Holyrood going into recess, and possibly sitting for fewer days when they , it is even more essential that the media is allowed to do its job.We have, of course, the daily press conferences in London and Edinburgh. While vital, they have their limitations, the most obvious of which is the lack of follow-up questions. Time and again the questions being asked are not answered, but there is no comeback and the show rolls on.What is required, in addition to these daily press conferences, are extended interviews with Ministers. Some have taken place, but more are needed, particularly ones where the questioner can drill down for answers. Never has Andrew Neil been more missed than now.It should be said that some of our politicians are reacting to this crisis better than others. Even those who disagree with her on much  would have to concede Scotlandrsquos First Minister has been a been a model of clarity and a reassuring presence throughout.As for the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, there is much talk of a vigorous, ordered response, but once again there is a large gap between the rhetoric and the reality.There will come a time for reckoning on this pandemic, locally, nationally and globally. That could be a long way down the road. Many will have to account for what they did, or did not do, in this crisis and explain how vital time was lost in preparing for it.In the meantime, the public has to feel sure it is being told everything it needs to know, and that the steps being taken by governments are the right ones. We need answers, yes, but we need a lot more questioning besides.The public is ready, willing and able to do the right thing during this lockdown.

However, for this study researchers allowed for the fact that about % of people use dferent hands for dferent tasks which further improved the accuracy for their findings.The University of St Andrews said that understanding handedness contributes to our understanding of human evolution.For example, it has been claimed that right-handedness, along with the capacity to make and use tools, to use language and to show al and anatomical cerebral specialisation, are characteristics specic to humans, and that they are intimately tied together in the ergent evolution of man from apes.The lead UK author of the study, Dr Silvia Paracchini, of the School of Medicine at St Andrews, said: \"This study will provide a useful reference for dferent areas of handedness research.\"In addition to providing reliable figures, the study highlights iability across studies depending on the dferent criteria used to measure handedness.:Left-handers more inhibited and anxious, new study finds\"While we intuitively classy handedness as a left right category, these data show that the proportion of people using dferent hands for dferent tasks is almost as big as the proportion of the left-handers.\"The reason for people favouring a right hand is often assumed to be because it is controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain, which is also dominant for language in about  per cent of us.Some argue that this ision of neurological labour has been a feature of animals for half a billion years.Some believe it is because it is more efficient to allow the two hemispheres to carry out dferent computations at the same time.The left side of the brain, for instance, might have evolved to carry out routine operations ndash things like foraging for food ndash while the right side was kept free to detect and react rapidly to unexpected challenges in the environment like an approaching predator.This can be seen in ious fish, toads and birds, which are all more likely to attack prey seen in the right eye.But is there any evolutionary advantage to being right or left-handed It appeared, perhaps around , years ago, that there was a clear right-handed preference in prehistoric societies.Wear on the preserved teeth of Homo heidelbergensis, for instance, suggest that food was usually brought to the mouth with the right hand.But according to a  paper in the journal Psychological Bulletin, \"there is remarkably little evidence for any association of left-handedness with deficit, as has often been suggested\".In fact, some research shows that left-handeds might even have an easier time recovering from brain damage. And their left hand seems to have the advantage of surprise in a fight, which means they can be better at combat sports."},{"url":null,"title":"ministers-urged-take-urgent-action-rail-yard-closure","story":"Scottish Labour made the call after it emerged Wabtec is planning to ldquoconsolidate its operations in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, following a reduction in orders.This would result in the closure of its Kilmarnock base ndash originally opened as Andrew Barclay and Sons in  ndash which has helped refurbish recent Abellio ScotRail and ScotRail models.The move would be a further blow to an industry recovering from the closure of the St Rollox ldquoCaley rail depot in Springburn last year, costing  jobs and ending more than  years of history at the site.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard insisted Transport Secretary Michael Matheson must inspect tender documents to ensure Wabtec is not breaching contract conditions.Mr Leonard said the company ldquois currently working on a number of contracts funded by several millions of pounds of public money, including funding from the Scottish Government.In a letter to Mr Matheson, he wrote: ldquoI would appreciateyou might be able to provide an assurance that you will inspect the tender specication and all associated documentation, in particular any conditions placed on the company about the amount of work that has to be done in Scotland, to ensure they are meeting these conditions in full.He added: ldquoThe company has chosen ndash exactly one week after sending a letter to its workers to tell them they were key workers, vital to the connectivity of the Scottish economy ndash to announce plans to make its -strong workforce at the site redundant.ldquoOnly last year the workforce assisted the company to become more competitive by agreeing to a reduction in the overtime rate and the midweek sht allowance.He continued: ldquoI would reiterate that given the importance of this site not only to the local economy but also to the rail infrastructure of Scotland, it is of the utmost importance that the Government and its agencies work with the company to ensure their skills are retained.ldquoIf the company are allowed to close this site, the Government must act with urgency to produce a strategy to retain these jobs.Mr Leonard, who campaigned to save the St Rollox railway works, warned the Wabtec closure could mean some workers will be laid off twice in quick succession.He said: ldquoSNP ministers used the continued operation of Wabtec at Kilmarnock as part of a series of excuses to justy their failure to step in and save the Caley.

A brief list would include the following:, Brexit. This should be delayed indefinitely or preferably scrapped. The UK and our friends in the  member states are in no position to discuss or agree any sort of deal at this time. For the same reasons, forget trying to do a deal with Donald Trumprsquos America. Neither they nor we will achieve anything worthwhile until we know how our respective governments survive the present emergency., Trident. This should be cancelled. It is of no use against pandemics, terrorism or climate change, which are the real dangers facing us today. Spend the money on the NHS, conventional forces and much-needed surface ships., HS. This vanity project should be scrapped on cost and environmental grounds. Ditto fantasy projects such as bridges tunnels across the Irish Sea., NHS. Implement a realistic hospital building programme, fully funded and staffed, with the spare capacity and equipment to cope with any demand.. Welfare. This needs a complete overhaul, especially the disastrous Universal Credit. Those who find themselves in financial straits for whatever reason, must get the funds they need when they need them not weeks or months later., Westminster. This antiquated establishment must be dragged into the st century and the anachronism that is the House of Lords should scrapped and replaced with a democratically elected second chamber a fraction of its present size.Personally, I would like to see an independent Scotland in Europe. However, one thing is certain, we cannot go back to the status quo. Major reform has been required for many years. Now is the time.Angus Ferguson, Glasgow G.WE are in this lockdown situation at the moment and some of the information we are being given is indicating that it could go on for months. This is surely unacceptable.It would surely be possible to ask all businesses to come up with plans to get back to work but meeting the current rules of distancing. It would also be necessary to include rules about travel to work, but I am sure a lot could be done. One size fits all is not good enough. Many local shops employ people who can walk to work and could easily fit locks to doors to allow one or two customers in at a time. I think there would be many good ideas come out of this and it would not be impossible to monitor.I remember being on a course many years ago where one of the exerciss was to lay out a workshop meeting certain constraints and it was surprising the dferent solutions which came up.We must do somethingwe are not to face a situation where many businesses close, where debt is enormous and le is poorer for many.Jim McAdam, Maidens.NO doubt many studies will be done and many lessons will be learned from Covid- by all nations after it has been controlled as to what worked best, from containment to testing, PPE procurement to distribution to the frontline carers and beyond, to a cure.Every cloud has a silver lining and in this unprecedented case in tackling this pandemic, it seems many Government critics in the media have acquired - vision.If we have to prepare for every and any future eventuality, the same critics will be the first to question the unnecessary cost for something that may never happen.Trident is an obvious example of something no one wants to pay for, or use, but until all world powers agree to multilateral disarmament it acts as a costly deterrent.How many of the critics would leave their front door open and cancel home, car and le insurances It is one thing for the opposition to rightly hold the Government to account but another for the media to seek fault and apportion blame in retrospect. They too have a duty to report news rather than fabricate and create hyperbolic headlines for want of an original story. We should not need to work out fact from fiction depending on who the messenger is.Allan Thompson, Bearsden.IT would appear that following the latest briefings there are too many dferent priorities running in parallel, mixed messaging again. It strikes me that Government leaders are contradicting the medical professionals whom they claim they are following. While I do have to some sympathise with our elected leaders, this far down the line the glitches should have been sorted out.We are losing too many members of our society in the race to halt this deadly pandemic the Government has been too slow to respond swtly to the outbreak, but no we must we must focus fully as one to halt it.Iain Rowan, Largs.NON-PRIORITYconstruction works are currently still being permitted in England and only a few house buildershave so far voluntarily suspended works. According to Construction News, a leading publication for the building industry, there are many Scottish, and English, businesses who will be are under threat from their customers down south to come up with the materials, labour, and sometimes both, to satisfy their contractual terms or suffer the consequences.I can understand that the supply chain requires to keep in operation for essential works, but this is where both Governments need to get their heads together over the definition of \"essential\". As an aside, I worked in the building trade for  years and the two-metre rule is a total non-starter.George Dale, Beith.MIKE Wilsonwonders what might happen in a worst-case scenario of a post-coronavirus economic collapse.He needs to look no further than the data on the World Bank website.The old Soviet Union disintegrated in the early s, and the economy went into meltdown. In , the le expectancy at birth of Russian men was just over  years. It did notto this level until about , having dropped by between two to five years in the interim. Le expectancy for Russian women also fell during this time, but not by so much.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.IN these very clever digital days would it not be possible for supermarkets to take plants from the local nurseries and sell them outside their own stores   Clever little machines could take our payments by contactless means, and the gardens of Scotland bloom throughout the summer as ever.We are all now used to queueing, keeping the statutory two metres apart, and a plant stall in a corner of a supermarket car park surely would not cause trouble  Perhaps volunteers from amongst keen gardeners could be found to \"staff\" the stalls  I would be happy to put in an hour or two each day.It is going to be a sad summer without the beautul plants.

Preach, sister. It does seem to be the way forward, andI had a positivity wall Irsquod include embrace the nose hairs, ditch the razor and rock the greys.Truth be told, I could do with a positivity wall of my own. For the last two days Irsquove woken up feeling flat. Nothing particularly dramatic, just a bit bleurgh, with a sort of tugging feeling that something isnrsquot right. In fact, at ious points during the last two days whenever Emma has talked about her positivity wall, Irsquove fantasised about taking a marker pen, rushing into her house and writing in huge black letters, ldquoItrsquos all going to hell! all over it. .On our socially distant walks where she strides on  metres in front of me and we phone each other to chat, Irsquove wanted to bark down the phone, ldquoDonrsquot tell me whorsquos done what on Taskmaster, or how good you are at Words With Friends. I donrsquot know them, I donrsquot want to know them, and I have too many apps on my phone anyway.Wersquove talked about it and we laugh, but this is not like me at all. On Skype calls with friends and family talking to three grainy faces in boxes Irsquove found myself reaching out to touch the tablet or phone, yearning for that physical contact that previously I didnrsquot even think about. My self-diagnosis: Irsquom missing the hugs. That glorious daily injection of oxytocin is lacking from my le and Irsquom experiencing the big, mad come-down. No hugs from my dad because hersquos self-isolating after a bowel cancer operation or mum whorsquos with him. No hugs from my brother because hersquos in the high risk category. No hugs from friends or colleagues because they are stuck in boxes on my phone and no hugs from my son because, well, hersquos a teenager and sadly immune to the joys of a good, meaty hug.So what should be on my wall of positivity  Irsquove leached some thoughts from friends today. One of my favourites is from a flight attendant chum who says as someone who can be in two continents a day, every day, she loves staying in one place ndash having a routine, cooking and eating nutritious food and being present in the moment. Another said: ldquoAw, man, I can reach new levels of laziness and feel absolutely no shame in it whatsoever.One, who is a key worker, said she loves the fact that her daughters ndash who would usually niggle and wind each other up ndash have the house cleaned, tidied and the food on the table when she gets back from work. And another has taken the time away from the daily grind to reconnect with his son and use every day to walk in the wilderness. One slightly nosey mum whipped out the binoculars to spy on her teenage son as he ldquonipped out for a second only to see him placing a Playstation game on the ground, withdraw, and then another teenager furtively walk up and replace his game with one of his. Collective sighs of relief all round.Yesterday brought an impromptu coronavirus moment to my street, which Irsquoll remember for a while: -year-old Sandyrsquos door, festooned with happy birthday balloons and banners, slowly opened as he walked out into the blinding spring sunshine and we all sang to him, young and old, from far flung places and near, accompanied by an accordion and a concertina. As he sipped a fine malt, and we did wee socially distant jigs and clapped him, he blinked at the huge dumpling made for him by one of the neighbours and said: \"Right, whorsquos for a Strip the Willow then \"It was a moment of pure humanity, love and joy.

This came as welcome news to Orkney MSP Liam McArthur, who had previously highlighted these concerns. The moves were also welcomed by Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston.The Loganair aircraft will be based at Glasgow Airport but can operate throughout Scotland.   Loganair pilots will be operating the aircraft as usual, and late last week, all received a special briefing from the airline and the Scottish Ambulance Service on the nature of the deployment.Work has continued in Loganair’s Engineering and Flight Operations teams at Glasgow over the weekend and into this week to ensure full readiness of the aircraft ahead of full mission readiness from Friday  April.Loganair is also now working to convert a larger Saab  aircraft, capable of operating into all Highlands and Islands airports apart from Barra, to become an air ambulance with the capability to carry two Epishuttle pods and accompanying medical teams simultaneously.  It is expected this aircraft will be available within the next seven days.Loganair’s Chief Executive Jonathan Hinkles said: “The team effort to make this happen, moving from a concept to an operational solution in just a week, has been absolutely incredible.#Between the SAS and Loganair teams, the concept, testing and training has all taken place and we’re also grateful for the support from the Civil Aviation Authority in progressing this project.“Although the circumstances under which all of this work has been undertaken are ones that we’d never have wished to see, I’m heartened that the effort which has gone into this is truly admirable. We will support the Scottish Ambulance Service, the NHS and the island communities who rely on Loganair for their leline air servicesand when our assistance is needed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Since the pandemic was announced and subsequent lockdown measures, many businesses have been forced to close their doors. Other businesses face greater demand than usual and many of them have implemented new safety measures in the workplace to ensure work can go on and needs are met across many sectors. Chief Executive of the Londonderry Chamber, Paul Clancy said: “The response of the business community at this time has been phenomenal. Unfortunately, many businesses which are deemed non-essential have had to close their doors and furlough staff. However, many more face increased pressures and a surge in demand for services. googletag.cmd.push “The demand for food and other essential items such as cleaning items and medicines means that lots of businesses in those supply chains are working even harder to meet the demand. “I have heard from many businesses in recent days who have introduced new social distancing measures to keep things going. That means reducing sht patterns to manage numbers of people at work at any one time, or re-engineering factory floor plans to protect staff. Some we know have even sought out new premises to use in the short term. “The pragmatism of businesses at this time is great to see, not to mention the dedication of workers who continue to show up at work every day. Safety of the workforce has never been more important and we have seen so many examples of responsible employers and their staff working together to manage this. googletag.cmd.push “Lots of them may not see themselves as frontline workers, but they are contributing to the wider national effort that will ensure that shelves are stocked and people do not go without at this very worrying time.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Minister also emphasised that every conceivable effort is being made to improve both situations. “I can assure staff and the wider public that these two issues are receiving absolute priority. It’s no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites. “Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly. googletag.cmd.push “This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs. “I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that. “However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Swann stressed:“I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.” Turning to PPE, the Minister said:“Our health service has signicant levels of PPE in stock at present but need to boost these quantities given the expected level of demand in coming weeks. Our PPE supplies have been supported through release of % of the emergency pandemic stockpile as announced last week – in the region of  million items. “Updated UK-wide NHS guidance on PPE use has been issued. This guidance will inform PPE use across our system and help us to prioritise distribution. “I fully understand that staff on the frontline need reassurance. I believe the updated guidance and securing greater quantities of PPE for Northern Ireland will both play a part in allaying concerns. “I want to make absolutely clear that the PPE guidance is about ensuring staff have the appropriate level of protection for the circumstances they are working in – it is absolutely not, nor will it ever be, about seeking to restrict the use of equipment.” He continued:“The situation with PPE supply has been made more challenging by the fact that supply routes from China, a leading global provider, were closed until recently. “I am actively working with the Finance Minister to pursue all feasible supply routes, both international and local. “I recognise that other NI Departments are also facing PPE challenges. We have to tackle this together across the Executive and also to appreciate the scale of global competition for PPE products. The Minister added:“It would be facile for anyone to suggest that there has been any lack of urgency. We are doing everything we can to best of our ability to make things better. “Our health service has been under consider financial pressure for the past  years. That has inevitably had a bearing on its capacity. I cannot undo that, but I will work night and day for the sake of the public and our great health and social care staff.

There certainly should be a coordinated approach North and South but there are actions Stormont Executive parties and the Dail have not been willing to act on when it comes to PPE, Covid- test kits and ventilators. They havent been willing to put public health ahead of private companies raking in massive profits in the midst of this crisis. This is why their response has been slow, inadequate and putting lives at risk. googletag.cmd.push When the WHO declared Covid- a global pandemic on January  manufacturers should have been directed by Westminster, Stormont and the Dail to repurpose production to mass produce PPE. This didnt happen and now were scrambling to get them from China. It can still happen. For testing of Covid- and mass testing, Randox Laboratories in Crumlin, Antrim, should be put under public control. Randox has received tens of millions in public money but have be allowed to go on a profiteering binge. Instead of being directed to mass produce testing kits as part of an integrated all-Ireland health strategy theyve been able to charge exorbitant prices. Prince Charles, Boris Johnson and elites get tested while workers and the sick dont. Put Randox under public control now. googletag.cmd.push Randox pays Tory MP Owen Patterson pound, a year and have been allowed to put profits for shareholders ahead of people and profit. The rich and powerful shouldnt have access to testing when frontline workers cant. Thirdly, Medtronic based in Galway, is a global manufacturer of le-saving ventilators. Medtronic should also be put under public control to produce thousands of ventilators for health services North and South. Business cant go on as usual in response to this crisis. Private companies cant be allowed to put profiteering ahead of people and health. These are actions that should be taken but the political establishment, so long subservient to powerful corporations, wont contemplate them unless they come under pressure to do so. We need to keep pressing and demanding.

It read: “During the disturbances of  it enjoyed comparative tranquillity.” Anyone living in the County Derry town at the time of the ill-fated United Irishmen rebellion would no doubt disagree. The ins and outs of the  rebellion were played out at a local level across the country, something local historian Joseph McCoy thinks is not mentioned enough in schools. He says: “I understand the necessity to look at the First and Second World Wars, but they have so little about the place we’re living in, particularly the local stuff. googletag.cmd.push “The story of  in Maghera is complex. There’s a whole plethora of dferent writers on the subject but no two stories are the same. That tells me that they are pulling a lot from folklore.” Troops had been stationed in the town before the rising began in June  and the rebellious plans were being drawn up around them. An account of how recoat army captain Francis Lamont met and married the daughter of hotel proprietor Jack O’Neill bears testament to this. Captain Lamont, second in command to Colonel Leith, had been passing what is now known as Walsh’s, when he found himself transfixed by a young girl working in the hotel. googletag.cmd.push When she ed his glance, the captain turned to his superior and told him in no uncertain terms thatshe were not yet married, she would be his we. The pair were married in May  and Lamont was named on a list of people who donated to the building of Glen chapel, where the couple rest in the graveyard. It was certainly not the last time love flourished with a meeting of eyes in Walsh’s Hotel.  History and folklore have weaved a rich tapestry of tragedy, violence, compassion and love at the foot of the Glenshane in . The town was so involved in the skirmishes that after the uprising failed, Colonel Leith’s redcoat army may have planned to reduce it to rubble in retribution. In an article for the Maghera Times, a local historical paper, Joseph McCoy wrote: “Initial suggestions tell us that the army was prepared to blow the town to pieces with a detachment of cannon, which had been placed on top of a hill overlooking the town.” However, Maghera was spared, and the people lived to pass on the tales of the rebellion’s leaders in the town, many of whom suffered reprisals in its aftermath. Rev. John Glendy  Rev. Glendy provided leadership to the volunteers in the years leading up to , which led to James Spottswood of the Salters Company in Magherafelt admonishing him in print in . He wrote: “Glendy of Maghera is tainted with the blackest principles of revolution. His many sermons are but discourses containing treason. “We have seen him on erse occasion with the Popish priest of Magherafelt in that union of the Romish Church with whom he does conspire against this Realm.” Glendy composed the oath sworn by all members of the United Irishmen, and at some meetings, stood behind a pulpit bearing the legend ‘vive la Republique’, in a nod to the French revolution. As expected, the hunt for Glendy in the aftermath of the rebellion was an earnest one. He fled to a place called the Grove where he stayed with a man named Wilson for a fortnight. One popular account of how Glendy evaded capture was by borrowing a petticoat, cloak, bonnet and stockings from a woman named Sarah MacQuirken and escaping dressed as a woman. His escape was almost foiled when a local magistrate called Forrester recognised him, but his Presbyterian colleague, Clark, restrained him from making an arrest. The unusual attire also helped him evade a passing redcoat patrol in Tobermore, but his fate was sealed when troops surrounded a friend’s house and he was forced to hand himself in. Glendy was imprisoned on a barge moored in Belfast Lough before being exiled in America, where he became chaplain to the US House of Representatives in  and the Senate in . He passed away in Philadelphia in October  and is buried in Baltimore. Walter ‘Watty’ Graham  Synonymous with the GAA tradition in Glen, the name Watty Graham is familiar in Maghera and its surrounds. Graham was an Elder in the local Presbyterian church and had been central to organising the rebellion’s activity in Maghera. After it was quelled, his house was set on fire in reprisal and after a bounty of pound was placed on his head, he set off for Magilligan, from where he intended to travel to Moville. En route, he stopped at the Rectory of Tamlaght, where he intended to collect pound that the occupier, Mr Church owed him. Mr Church said he would have to go to Maghera to get the money but, in truth, intended to turn him into the authorities in a bid to clear his debt and collect a handsome reward. A servant girl overheard Church telling his we of the plan, and he swore her to secrecy, but the girl found a way to warn Watty Graham of the betrayal. In his book ‘Famous Maghera Men, Eoin Walsh writes how the girl warned Graham using the phrase ‘A herring was never taken on bait’. Graham attempted to evade capture by grabbing a shovel from a nearby workman and telling him to run instead. The soldiers followed the workman, but the Rector spotted the ruse and alerted the soldiers to Graham’s presence. He was swtly arrested. Watty Graham was executed, decapitated and his head carried through the town of Maghera in an intimidatory warning to local supporters of the United Irishmen. His relatives are thought to have retrieved his remains and buried them. Mr Chuch did not live long to enjoy the fruits of his betrayal and was bludgeoned to death at the entrance to his avenue while attending a call to tend to a dying parishioner. William ‘Billy’ Cuddy  In the swirling air of mistrust that prevailed after the rebellion, suspicion was easily aroused, and it cost the le of an innocent man in Billy Cuddy. “An unseasonable jest cost him his le,” wrote Joseph McCoy in his Maghera Times article. Cuddy, a wheelwright and blue dyer by trade, had been employed to insert a pane of glass into a leaden window-frame and remarked that it would not be dficult to turn the lead into bullets. The owner of the house reported him to local clerical magistrate called Clotsworthy Soden, who had him arrested and sentenced to death. “Billy Cuddy had a fairly good relationship with the townsfolk, even the soldiers,” says Joseph. “Colonel Leith, commander of the royalist forces in Maghera, understood that Clotsworthy Soden was maybe overstretching his authority, but it was authority he had. “As they were taking him to his death, he recited the nd psalm at the top of his voice referring to the Rector being to blame for his downfall.” Colonel Leith asked Cuddy on the gallowshe wanted to leave the case in his hands. Many watching on considered it to be an act of mercy, but Cuddy tragically misunderstood the offer. He declared he would ‘leave it to a Higher Power’. Leith deemed that this was a rejection of his offer and William Cuddy was hanged. No further indignity was inflicted on his body though, and local tradition has it that he was cut down from the rope while still alive, nursed back to health and spirited away to America. A mock funeral is said to have been held in Maghera, and a weathered stone in the old St Lurach’s church bears the inscription ‘The Burying Place of William Cuddy’. The names of Glendy, Graham and Cuddy will not catch the eye of many modern-day history students, but they are ingrained in the town of Maghera and its rich history from this period. Their heroic and tragic stories will continue to be passed from generation to generation and the tangible history of Maghera’s United Irishmen will endure.

Paul Kerrigan was fouled by Fergal Doherty after three minutes and John Hayes sent Barry Gillis the wrong way from the resulting penalty. Less than  seconds later Fintan Gould blasted to the top corner with his magnicent finish from a tight angle. It would have been easy for Derry to conform to recent expectations and throw in the towel after what was a horrendous start to the game. When Daniel Goulding added a sixth minute free, the small crowd of Derry fans would have feared the worst. - to - behind and coming off the back of four straight defeats, there wasn’t much optimism flying about. googletag.cmd.push The reaction deserves credit. The performance was a massive improvement on that shown against Monaghan and Mayo in the two weeks previous. Paddy Bradley spearheaded the revival, kicking three of Derry’s seven unanswered point that turned a six point deficit into a one-point lead. It was a spell of pretty ruthless football from the Oakleafers, although had Mark Lynch had another half second to get the ball to his foot, his close range effort might not have been smothered by Paddy O’Shea. Still, with seven minutes to go to the half, Damian Cassidy’s side led by a point and were capitalising on a lot of Cork errors. googletag.cmd.push Without Patsy Bradley, Derry lost the kick-out battle and soon Cork were back in the game again. Cork led by threeat the interval, and maintained a similar degree of comfort until the latter stages. But when Raymond Wilkinson and Paddy Bradley pointed to leave Derry just a point behind going into injury time, they just needed a little bit of composure. Charlie Kielt and Mark Lynch kicked a wide each before Paul Kerrigan just booted the ball over the line to allow Marty Duffy to call time and see the Munstermen home with a rare two points from Ulster.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The council today said there has been an increased pressure on its collections as a result of the current coronavirus crisis. A council spokesperson said: “Our refuse collection service continues to remain operational and we are seeing an increase in calls and queries relating to waste management and are currently looking at a bespoke COVID- waste response mechanism that could assist in dealing with this increased pressure on waste services. “This is currently being scoped out and in the interim period the public are being asked to work with Council to try not to put additional pressure on waste services during this emergency period.” googletag.cmd.push The council said people can help by doing the following: - Please leave your bins out for collection at an earlier time of am to allow crews to get around all households. - Please do not leave out black bags - Council cannot collect additional black bags left beside bins, please use the blue, black and brown bins provided appropriately, making sure to separate waste as usual according to recycling guidelines and dispose of waste responsibly. - You should have adequate bin capacity as long as you are not dumping unnecessary additional items. Please do not put additional pressure on Council waste services resources and staff during this emergency period. googletag.cmd.push To assist the council to limit the spread of the virus, they would encourage the public to • Clean the lids and handles of bins before and after collection. • Dispose of tissues and disposable cleaning wipes separately placing them in two plastic bags, tying and storing inside for  days before putting in the external black bin. • Place all food waste in compostable bags and ensure that they are tied before putting in your BROWN BIN. • Bring bins out either the night before their scheduled collection day or before am on collection day. • Park considerately so lorries can access streets to service bins.

Worse than war  We`re scared, we`re sad. We`re bored and lonely.  Missing school and all my friends, Home school with mum and dad at the kitchen table, No trips out not even to the shop, Every day is the same.  Routine has disappeared like snow in the sun But there’s a rainbow in our window All`s not gone, there’s still hope Its not forever but it feels like it right now! Clodagh Bradley, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea   The Coronavirus Coronavirus, what a funny name All I know is it ruins all our fun and games We can’t go to school in case we get infected Scientists are trying to get medicine to get us injected I miss the park, having sleepovers and playing in the dark Make sure you wash your hands If you don’t it could catch you too. Emily Brizzell, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea  Year  pupils at Limavady High School also gave us their take on the current crisis...  It is strange working from home during lock down, because I don’t have to change classrooms every  minutes and I get to work in my dad’s office out the back of his house. I also get to spend more time with my family, my mum, dad, two sisters and two brothers. Every day I do Home Economics by helping to make dinner and I do Technology out in my dad’s workshop. I miss getting to see other people, my family and my friends, but I can still phone them at any time. I don’t have any homework in the evenings now because I have done it during the day. In the morning I write out my timetable for that day ahead and do PE on YouTube at :am. I miss going out for walks throughout the day, but I find other things to do. By Rebecca Hockley. I    Lockdown over the last week has definitely been one interesting experience. It’s one experience I hope we never have to repeat. One of the positive things about this is I get to watch a lot more TV as well as doing schoolwork during the day. The main thing I miss about school is not being able to see any of my friends until September again. I am still trying to get used to not having to get up at .am every morning and having my lunch at dferent times and especially not having to get a bus. I am also going to miss some of the teachers in our school as well. With a really strange week nearly up, I have to admit the schoolwork isn’t as bad as I thought it was first going to be. Jack Bredin F      When I heard we were going in lockdown I didn’t know what to expect. My first thought was you could not go out of the house except shopping for food. My mum and dad explained to me what lockdown meant. They explained that I could still go outside, but only for one form of exercise. So I choose to run. I feel sad that I am not going to have face to face contact with my friends but I’m lucky to have Wi and I talk to my friends daily. The positive side of lockdown is I get to spend more time with my two brothers and my sister. They are company and together we try to support each other with our home schooling. Lockdown is giving me a chance to help my mum and dad about the house and learn new skills like cooking, cleaning and building. My mum jokes this will make my future we happy! Alex Donnell F   Le under lockdown is very boring because I cannot see my friends or some of my family members. It is also not great because I cant go to school either and see my friends and teachers, but I can get out for some fresh air and I can get lots of things done around the house that I cant get done when I was at school. I do miss the fun at school and getting to see my friends but hopefully sometime soon we will come out of lockdown. Remember to wash your hands and stay at a social distance from each other when you are outside. Alex McMichael F   Social Distancing Le in the fast lane has had to stop We are only allowed out to exercise or shop Wash your hands is the golden rule Never thought Id say that Id miss school My brother’s crying because hes fed up My sisters cracking up with her laptop Everyone is trying to be kind Always keeping the vulnerable in mind Essential staff have had to work Home schooling is driving parents berserk I miss my Grandparents theyre the best At least I am giving their heads a rest It’s now we realise what is important to us No point huffing or puffing or causing a fuss My family is so important to me Just think in a few weeks we can be free For everyone out there please take care This virus could be lurking anywhere Corona Virus is a mystery But please remember we are making History! Jay Scott I   Le under lock down can be very boring but fun at the same time. I don`thave to wake up as early and get to sleep in a bit longer. Idon`t have to move around every half an hour to get to my next class. I can take my time in doing my work and don`t have to rush through everything. Sometimes it can get really annoying, how the time passes really slowly or being stuck in the house in general. Some days I do wish I could go back to school because the time flies by a lot quicker and the day does not feel as long. I have a lot more family time and get to spend more quality time with my sister. I also get to annoy my parents which I do anyway! Amelia Sinclair A   It is a very strange feeling not being able to leave the house, it’s like being imprisoned! I miss playing with my friends and being in school learning alongside them. I am spending more time in my bedroom at my desk working on schoolwork which can feel boring and hard work as I can find learning a challenge! However, being away from school makes me appreciate the help and support I get in school from my teachers. On a positive note, being in lock down I don’t have to wake up as early to catch the bus. My schooling at home is more flexible and I can take a break when I want to. I have been using technology to communicate with my friends. We all arranged a video call together and it was great to see them and have a chat. Having to stay at home with only my family for company means we are spending more time together, eating together, playing together and enjoying our family PE lessons daily with Joe Wicks! We have a laugh together as we exercise. I am trying to stay positive and as a family we are trying to think of fun activities to do together like, going on a bike ride in the countryside, going on walks, do some baking, watching movies and at Easter time we are going to have Easter egg hunt in the garden. Stay positive everyone and keep safe. Isaac Morrison Year    Finally, we have the Taylor family from Limavady, who gave us an account of how children in the same house, but of dferent ages, are reading the situation.  Covid- My name is Harry and I’m a schoolboy during the coronavirus Covid- pandemic. I have to be home-schooled right now because the virus is running rampage. Personally, I think my mummy is a really good teacher. We have to use social distancing to stay safe in shops or pharmacies. This coronavirus outbreak is NOT scary in my eyes. I just think of it as a really bad cold that’s killing the elderly, so it should be called ‘The Elderly Killer’. It was just Monday night when lockdown was put into action in the UK. Also, being home-schooled has its pros and cons. Pros: getting to wear what you want activities every afternoon, sibling humour, your own back garden. Cons: full school day, digital PE. Harry Taylor, , Limavady  My Le Right Now Hello, my name is Molly and I am  years old. Right now there is an illness called coronavirus, also called Covid-. I am being home-schooled. I really hate having no friends in home-school, and no line points. I love still having a textbook, activities, doing PE and having Star of the Week. On Friday, Mummy had to pick up the packs from my school and Daddy works hard and late. Mammy teaches us and soon she might have to go in and look after key workers’ children. She said she might have to bring me and my brother and sister. Molly Taylor, , Limavady   Everything’s Not Normal Hi, my name is Emily and I am  years old. I am being home-schooled right now because of coronavirus Covid-. My mummy is a really good teacher, she makes really fun days for us. My teacher sent me home instructions to make a rain maker. I learnt about how the sun warms up the earth and the water goes up to the sky to make clouds. I am learning to do story writing. I did PE with Joe Wicks on YouTube and we made buns. I miss my swimming. I wrote letters to my friends because I miss them too. I can’t wait until it’s back to normal. Emily Taylor, , Limavady  If your child is working on something - wed love to hear from you.

Wash your hands, sing Happy Birthday in your head.  It’s horrid, it’s bad, it’s terrible too. No more school, no more sports. If you go out you could go to court. Stay away, it’s awful indeed.  Everyone’s sad, we want it to go. It’s crushing our dreams, sadly not slow. We’re bored, we’re sad, there’s nowhere to go We can’t go swimming or to the movies.  People are sick, people are scared. Please help us God, we’ll all say our prayers. It’s a huge impact on our modern le. Just stay indoors or you are risking a le. By Aine McGill, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea   The Invisible Danger Coronavirus go away! Its disrupting our lives everyday, The NHS are busy, people are getting sick. You’re an invisible danger.  Worse than war  We`re scared, we`re sad. We`re bored and lonely.  Missing school and all my friends, Home school with mum and dad at the kitchen table, No trips out not even to the shop, Every day is the same.  Routine has disappeared like snow in the sun But there’s a rainbow in our window All`s not gone, there’s still hope Its not forever but it feels like it right now! Clodagh Bradley, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea   The Coronavirus Coronavirus, what a funny name All I know is it ruins all our fun and games We can’t go to school in case we get infected Scientists are trying to get medicine to get us injected I miss the park, having sleepovers and playing in the dark Make sure you wash your hands If you don’t it could catch you too. Emily Brizzell, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea  Year  pupils at Limavady High School also gave us their take on the current crisis...  It is strange working from home during lock down, because I don’t have to change classrooms every  minutes and I get to work in my dad’s office out the back of his house. I also get to spend more time with my family, my mum, dad, two sisters and two brothers. Every day I do Home Economics by helping to make dinner and I do Technology out in my dad’s workshop. I miss getting to see other people, my family and my friends, but I can still phone them at any time. I don’t have any homework in the evenings now because I have done it during the day. In the morning I write out my timetable for that day ahead and do PE on YouTube at :am. I miss going out for walks throughout the day, but I find other things to do. By Rebecca Hockley. I    Lockdown over the last week has definitely been one interesting experience. It’s one experience I hope we never have to repeat. One of the positive things about this is I get to watch a lot more TV as well as doing schoolwork during the day. The main thing I miss about school is not being able to see any of my friends until September again. I am still trying to get used to not having to get up at .am every morning and having my lunch at dferent times and especially not having to get a bus. I am also going to miss some of the teachers in our school as well. With a really strange week nearly up, I have to admit the schoolwork isn’t as bad as I thought it was first going to be. Jack Bredin F      When I heard we were going in lockdown I didn’t know what to expect. My first thought was you could not go out of the house except shopping for food. My mum and dad explained to me what lockdown meant. They explained that I could still go outside, but only for one form of exercise. So I choose to run. I feel sad that I am not going to have face to face contact with my friends but I’m lucky to have Wi and I talk to my friends daily. The positive side of lockdown is I get to spend more time with my two brothers and my sister. They are company and together we try to support each other with our home schooling. Lockdown is giving me a chance to help my mum and dad about the house and learn new skills like cooking, cleaning and building. My mum jokes this will make my future we happy! Alex Donnell F   Le under lockdown is very boring because I cannot see my friends or some of my family members. It is also not great because I cant go to school either and see my friends and teachers, but I can get out for some fresh air and I can get lots of things done around the house that I cant get done when I was at school. I do miss the fun at school and getting to see my friends but hopefully sometime soon we will come out of lockdown. Remember to wash your hands and stay at a social distance from each other when you are outside. Alex McMichael F   Social Distancing Le in the fast lane has had to stop We are only allowed out to exercise or shop Wash your hands is the golden rule Never thought Id say that Id miss school My brother’s crying because hes fed up My sisters cracking up with her laptop Everyone is trying to be kind Always keeping the vulnerable in mind Essential staff have had to work Home schooling is driving parents berserk I miss my Grandparents theyre the best At least I am giving their heads a rest It’s now we realise what is important to us No point huffing or puffing or causing a fuss My family is so important to me Just think in a few weeks we can be free For everyone out there please take care This virus could be lurking anywhere Corona Virus is a mystery But please remember we are making History! Jay Scott I   Le under lock down can be very boring but fun at the same time. I don`thave to wake up as early and get to sleep in a bit longer. Idon`t have to move around every half an hour to get to my next class. I can take my time in doing my work and don`t have to rush through everything. Sometimes it can get really annoying, how the time passes really slowly or being stuck in the house in general. Some days I do wish I could go back to school because the time flies by a lot quicker and the day does not feel as long. I have a lot more family time and get to spend more quality time with my sister. I also get to annoy my parents which I do anyway! Amelia Sinclair A   It is a very strange feeling not being able to leave the house, it’s like being imprisoned! I miss playing with my friends and being in school learning alongside them. I am spending more time in my bedroom at my desk working on schoolwork which can feel boring and hard work as I can find learning a challenge! However, being away from school makes me appreciate the help and support I get in school from my teachers. On a positive note, being in lock down I don’t have to wake up as early to catch the bus. My schooling at home is more flexible and I can take a break when I want to. I have been using technology to communicate with my friends. We all arranged a video call together and it was great to see them and have a chat. Having to stay at home with only my family for company means we are spending more time together, eating together, playing together and enjoying our family PE lessons daily with Joe Wicks! We have a laugh together as we exercise. I am trying to stay positive and as a family we are trying to think of fun activities to do together like, going on a bike ride in the countryside, going on walks, do some baking, watching movies and at Easter time we are going to have Easter egg hunt in the garden. Stay positive everyone and keep safe. Isaac Morrison Year    Finally, we have the Taylor family from Limavady, who gave us an account of how children in the same house, but of dferent ages, are reading the situation.  Covid- My name is Harry and I’m a schoolboy during the coronavirus Covid- pandemic. I have to be home-schooled right now because the virus is running rampage. Personally, I think my mummy is a really good teacher. We have to use social distancing to stay safe in shops or pharmacies. This coronavirus outbreak is NOT scary in my eyes. I just think of it as a really bad cold that’s killing the elderly, so it should be called ‘The Elderly Killer’. It was just Monday night when lockdown was put into action in the UK. Also, being home-schooled has its pros and cons. Pros: getting to wear what you want activities every afternoon, sibling humour, your own back garden. Cons: full school day, digital PE. Harry Taylor, , Limavady  My Le Right Now Hello, my name is Molly and I am  years old. Right now there is an illness called coronavirus, also called Covid-. I am being home-schooled. I really hate having no friends in home-school, and no line points. I love still having a textbook, activities, doing PE and having Star of the Week. On Friday, Mummy had to pick up the packs from my school and Daddy works hard and late. Mammy teaches us and soon she might have to go in and look after key workers’ children. She said she might have to bring me and my brother and sister. Molly Taylor, , Limavady   Everything’s Not Normal Hi, my name is Emily and I am  years old. I am being home-schooled right now because of coronavirus Covid-. My mummy is a really good teacher, she makes really fun days for us. My teacher sent me home instructions to make a rain maker. I learnt about how the sun warms up the earth and the water goes up to the sky to make clouds. I am learning to do story writing. I did PE with Joe Wicks on YouTube and we made buns. I miss my swimming. I wrote letters to my friends because I miss them too. I can’t wait until it’s back to normal. Emily Taylor, , Limavady  If your child is working on something - wed love to hear from you.

Im calling on local groups and organisations to considertheir services meet the criteria andthey could benefit from this fund.

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours. Irsquove got comments from America, Netherlands, Europe, Australia.ldquoNormally our St Patrickrsquos Day consists of going to mass in Castlewellan, then heading to the Lodge and entertaining the community until lunchtime where everybody comes in for a bit of craic. Then we take the grandkids around ious venues where they all play and then itrsquos back home at about pm.Terry is the father of three daughters, the eldest being Slieve Croob councillor Roisin Howell, whose son Ruaacuteiriacute is currently the youngest ever over- All-Ireland Uilleann piper. His other two daughters are Cara and Aine.The love of traditional Irish music runs deep in Terryrsquos family with eight of his  grandchildren all musicians.ldquoI have been in self-isolation since my daughter Cara, whorsquos a nurse, advised me to stay in as I have type  diabetes, explained Terry.He continued with his Saturday night singalong for Motherrsquos Day recently when he played such favourites as A Mothers Loversquos A Blessing, Home and The Town I love So Well.Terry says that he will continue to perform every Saturday until the COVID- shutdown is lted. He plans to perform songs with an emigration flavour such as Song For Ireland, My Fatherrsquos House, Boston Rose and a medley of Rambles of Spring The Old Dungarvan Oak.ldquoThe songs are touching a chord with people who are far away from family at home so Irsquom getting a lot of requests, nearly too many to do all of them. I have people who are telling me that they are in tears at forwarding on a song to their son or daughter whorsquos where, added Terry.ldquoIrsquom getting - comments a time, I feel humbled. A lot of people are thanking me for lting their spirits and taking their minds of the situation now. The reason Irsquom keeping it going is for the health and wellbeing of the people in the community. The response Irsquove got from people in Downpatrick has been amazing.ldquoSadly, Irsquom very conscious that I hope that the people who are listening to me now will still be listening to me in six monthsrsquo time.Like many other people who are in self-isolation now, Terry is thinking of better days ahead.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be great to go on to a football field and host a massive concert after this is all over to say thank you to all those NHS and key workers who are looking after us all, he said.ldquoWe donrsquot know how long this is going to last, so in the meantime Irsquom going try and continue to sing an odd old song.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

Despite repeated promises that supplies are due from China, we have yet to hear how much was ordered, when it is due for arrival and how it will be managed,” he said.“We now need a clear statement from the finance minister. Our healthcare workers were told PPE was coming. We need to know what the status of the order is andfrontline workers are going to be forced to wait for lesaving equipment.The Department of Finance issued a statement saying: “In the last couple of weeks the finance minister has been assisting efforts to procure PPE and other supplies with both the Irish and British governments.“There is global demand for all these goods and equipment and the scale of the pandemic we face means this will necessitate multiple orders from a range of suppliers at home and overseas.“We are sourcing the market for supplies locally, nationally and internationally in places including China. The task has become even more challenging with the US and India entering the market.“We must all protect our frontline workers and the executive will be updated on the latest position on PPE later today.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

We gave management a week to respond but we have received no response.“The UK government has provided  percent compensation for the costs of leave to employers, while sales revenues for foodstuffs are very sharply up.“This refusal by Moy Park bosses is already causing deep resentment among workers,” Mr McKeever concluded.However, a spokesperson for Moy Park refuted the claims and said “We see our team as Food Heroes, who are working harder than ever to keep food production moving at this critical time.“Over the last number of weeks, we have been working tirelessly to ensure staff are safe and are recognised for their hard work. “We have measures in place to protect all team members, including those who are extremely vulnerable and front-line workers. “Those colleagues who have been contacted by the NHS to stay at home due to their medical condition will receive a minimum of % of their basic contractual pay while they shield and care for themselves. “We completely refute any suggestion that we are focused on profits over employee wellbeing. “This is a dficult time for us all and it is important that the Northern Ireland food industry shows that it can play its part in feeding the nation as this crisis unfolds.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Lidl in Portadown have been phenomenal and Irwin’s Bakery have also assisted.”He added: “I’ve assisted over  people and the list I have goes on for page, after page.“I’m going to people in all dferent areas with elderly self isolating.”Tristan manages to get out every few days, when he’s off work and isn’t left with much spare time.He works a  hour week and in his spare time can be doing delivery runs up to  hours a day.He said the people he was helping were really appreciative, some had cried with gratitude.Tristan also takes great care in terms of hygiene and infection control, using hand sanitiser before and after every visit, setting the food deliveries at the door and stepping back.And for Tristan those measures aren’t just about protecting himself and those he is helping but also his dad who suffers from COPD.If you would like to donate to Tristan’s efforts see his Just Giving page, www.justgiving and search PortadownUnite. \"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1585834314058.jpg--coronavirus__37_people_in_fermanagh___omagh_have_tested_positive.jpg?158583431400","title":"coronavirus  people in fermanagh omagh have tested positive ","story":"THERE are now  confirmed cases of Covid- in the Fermanagh and Omagh District Council area, new statistics show.As of am today , there have been  confirmed cases reported and sadly  people have now lost their le, up six from Wednesdays figures.The Public Health Agency says there have been  tests carried out for the virus in the past  hours, with a further  people testing positive.

Its no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites.Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly.This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs.I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that.However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.Mr Swann stressed: I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_ecfccffbfdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_bcacaddb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
