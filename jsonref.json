(Pictured at the naming ceremony for the  RRS Sir David Attenborough) The Duchess, who was once afraid of public speaking, which led to her talking in affected, clipped tones, now speaks faultlessly about causes close to her heart in a more natural voice.Her increased confidence has, inevitably, been reflected in her wardrobe, too, with a subtle makeover replacing her old ‘armour’ of knee-length tailored dresses and clutch bag with bold, designer blouses and chic mini-handbags. She has a new hairstyle and has even toned down her make-up.The insight into Kate’s values emerges in a special edition of The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine today, which reveals how she has become increasingly self-assured and focused on her priorities.A source said: ‘She is very clear on her priorities and the values that guide how she lives and works. It’s about treating other people well to get the best out of them.‘She takes her role very seriously and just wants to do the best job she can.’With attention fixed on recent controversies surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Prince Andrew, Kate’s quiet transformation has gone almost unnoticed.

Healthy food is expensive, cheap food isn\u0027t so much.         In total, Miss Hill\u0027s monthly outgoings come to £2,096.50. And her income, including her monthly Universal Credit payment, comes to just £1,969\u0027The doctors say I\u0027m not getting enough fruit and veg but I cannot comprehend spending much money on a meal. All I can afford is £1 pizza and £1 chips.\u0027But the mother had truly thought Universal Credit was the best option for her family.Miss Hill, whose parents help out when they can, said: \u0027I switched to Universal Credit because I was struggling to save my weekly income support benefits to pay my monthly bills.\u0027I felt this decision would be best for me and my boys as Universal Credit is paid monthly. The first payment takes four to five weeks to come through but your benefits stop straight away.\u0027I had to try to find money for new uniform and shoes. I cannot get a credit card, overdraft or loans because of a debt relief order.\u0027I\u0027ve had to call on a neighbour to borrow some money to pay my car insurance.\u0027Sometimes I wish I hadn\u0027t come off income support because at least I had my bills paid. But it was hard if I needed a new tyre on my car or my son got a hole in his school jumper.              Her £1,049 Universal Credit payment will be significantly reduced when she starts receiving her monthly salary. Although working parent recipients of Universal Credit are entitled to claim up to 85 per cent of their childcare costs, the bills must be paid upfront by parents and then reclaimed - something Miss Hill can\u0027t afford to do\u0027It\u0027s confusing because the amount of Universal Credit I get changes every month depending on how much childcare I\u0027m claiming and how much money I\u0027m earning.\u0027But it feels like I get a lot less money now.\u0027Miss Hill\u0027s working schedule means that she is required to pay for a full day\u0027s nursery fee even though she only works between 12pm and 5pm.Until her claim is upped to 30 hours a week of free childcare in January, Miss Hill is only able to claim 15 hours per week.Miss Hill said: \u0027No wonder some people choose to just pop another child out, probably an easier option because it\u0027s so much stress, but that\u0027s having a child for the wrong reasons.\u0027I didn\u0027t expect to be a single mother.

I cannot afford to pay for my childcare upfront\u0027Miss Hill applied for this but was told she would likely be denied as the amount she needed was so high.Miss Hill said: \u0027I\u0027m not looking for money I can blow on me, I\u0027m just trying to do better for me and my kids.\u0027I don\u0027t even know if I can cope with the stress or worry. I\u0027m just taking it a day at a time and praying I get accepted for the Flexible Support Fund to tide me over.\u0027If I don\u0027t then I\u0027ll have to quit my job and they will chase me to search for a new one. It will be a never ending circle.\u0027The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said it is looking into Miss Hill\u0027s case and has agreed to offer her help from the Flexible Support Fund.A DWP spokesperson said: \u0027 We\u0027re committed to helping everyone access the support they need. Up-front care costs can be claimed out of the Flexible Support Fund and Miss Hill\u0027s claim has been allowed.\u0027With Universal Credit, working parents can recover up to 85 per cent of eligible childcare costs.

Some Anglican priests who were already married when they converted to Roman Catholicism were able to continue to serve as priests.But it has not made an exception to its celibacy rule for the purpose of addressing shortages of priests. It is a discipline, though, not a dogma, and therefore can be changed.The synod does not make decisions. Only the pope can. Participants will vote on various articles in a final document, which will then go to the pope to decide whether to make it into an official Apostolic Exhortation."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/29/21/19082268-7518351-image-a-59_1569787672821.jpg","title":"Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge vows job claims Corbynistas want replace her","story":"Share this article The Jewish Labour Movement called the vote a \u0027shameful moment\u0027 for the party as Dame Margaret, 75, has spent her career fighting anti-Semitism and the BNP. Labour members in Dame Margaret\u0027s Barking seat said that, although the ballot triggering the reselection process was carried, 55 per cent of wards and more than 90 per cent of union branches had voted against it.

It is an endless battle with pride, shame, identity and especially language. I can’t imagine a worse way to begin it than as a teenage girl.No memoir captures my own post-asylum years like Eva Hoffman’s 1989 account of adolescence as a clever but foreign girl (a child of Holocaust survivors relocating to Canada) with no money and a heap of desires. Lost in Translation was published the year I arrived in the US from Iran (via Dubai and Italy), in a way similar to Hoffman: a child with no choice, old enough to struggle with English, habits, shame. I could have used the book then. I didn’t discover it until I was at college, but its truth stung me again and again until I was numb, and delirious with the joy of being understood – not by just any immigrant girl, but by a Harvard graduate, and a former editor of the New York Times Book Review.Every refugee has escaped from something, often unthinkable. Among ourselves, exiles know the best way to tell stories is with comedy. Mazen Maarouf’s Jokes for the Gunmen is a hilarious and bizarre portrait of childhood in wartime. These tales show the strangeness of the world through young eyes, and given their indistinct sense of place, they evoke many childhoods and many funny families (including mine). Maarouf’s power comes from knowing that humans will persist in their absurdity even to the point of death.For a rigorous journalistic understanding of today’s primary migrant route into Europe (through the western Balkans), I recommend BBC correspondent Nick Thorpe’s The Road Before Me Weeps. It is an intimate, heartbreaking account of daily life in transit, in this particular social and political context, and of the many ways these families are rejected and exploited along the way. I was blown away by how much this man saw – things that have taken me 30 years of reflection to be willing to talk about.One of the most infuriating distinctions made in today’s refugee debate is between refugees and economic migrants, who are often young men depicted as opportunists. In his novel Nowhere Man, Aleksandar Hemon dares to give the unpalatable immigrant boy a place. Here is Jozef, who arrived in Chicago before the siege of Sarajevo and must now watch his home turn to ruins, without even the designation of refugee as shelter. “I am complicated,” he says, as he struggles with a new identity thrust upon him by fate.The displacement narrative must naturally end with the gaze falling back on to home, and with the futility of return, the condition of permanent psychic exile. Anton Gill’s The Journey Back from Hell is a powerful collection of oral testimonies from survivors of the Holocaust, a symphony of old trauma and grief, and a complex depiction of the impossibility of going back.Literature is a means of calling out to others to share our truest stories. Lately, I have my eyes on No Friend But the Mountains, Behrouz Boochani’s memoir of his flight and incarceration on Manus Island, which he wrote on a phone and smuggled out of the prison. Boochani is still confined, his past out of reach, his future unknowable. I send him solidarity from this side of our intersecting saga.

The plan could help to balance the energy system without any perceptible impact for British households.Centrica said it has developed sophisticated software algorithms to harness thousands of smart appliances to respond when the energy system is under stress.These devices will automatically use electricity when there is ample renewable energy on the grid, and then pause their energy use when National Grid needs help steadying the energy system.Similar schemes have already begun pooling the energy potential of supermarket freezers and electric vehicle batteries, but this is the first time that home devices will help balance the grid too.Centrica’s innovation arm said National Grid had approved its plans to use home water tanks, built by a tech startup from Oxford University, alongside larger industrial equipment to deliver services that could automatically balance the electricity system.Charles Cameron, the chairman of Centrica Innovations, said the software could help homes save money by using electricity when it was at its cheapest and automatically responding at times of stress without any loss of efficiency or comfort for customers.The home devices will be aggregated alongside Centrica’s existing flexible power supplies, totalling 2.5GW of electricity capacity, mostly from business and industrial customers.Mixergy, the tech company behind the smart hot water tanks, said the technology will help consumers use less energy.The tank uses artificial intelligence to learn how much hot water a household uses, and at which times of day, to make sure that it doesn’t waste energy when hot water is unlikely to be needed.Pete Armstrong of Mixergy said the technology could pave the way for new energy tariffs, which would “reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by storing excess renewable energy on the grid”.“At the same time, we reduce bills for householders by only heating the amount of hot water they require,” he added.Centrica has rolled out around 100 smart water heaters since June this year, but within the next six years it hopes to grow its stable of fast-response devices to 1GW."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d7c88025a3da9b8279f3cc0dfaba1a93b04211/0_66_1840_1104/master/1840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3af0f9be611b8243a4812ab22edf3a3","title":"wholefruit chocolate barry callebaut","story":"Recipe is the latest innovation from Swiss chocolatier Barry CallebautIt is being hailed by its manufacturer as the newest chocolate since the hugely popular pink or ruby variety, and aimed unashamedly at the younger generation seeking healthier and more sustainable products.Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut – one of the largest in the world – has launched a new recipe which it claims is the first to use the entire cacao or cocoa fruit – as opposed to just the beans – to pack a more fruity punch in the flavour.The company says using the entire fruit, from beans to peels, pulp and juice, “results in a range of high-quality ingredients that can be used in … juices, smoothies, frozen desserts, bakery and pastry products, and snacks all the way to chocolate”.The so-called WholeFruit chocolate is the latest innovation from the Swiss chocolatier, which is facing pressure to innovate and experiment with new products amid growing competition in the global market. Higher cocoa prices have squeezed the profits of chocolate-makers already under pressure as consumers shift toward healthier alternatives.The company develops and supplies chocolate to major brands such as Nestlé, Hershey, Unilever and the confectionery giant Mondelez International, which owns brands including Cadbury and Toblerone.Mondelez will make the first new products under a new CaPao brand, being launched in the US this week, while a new line for artisan chocolate-makers will follow in May. Launch in the UK and Europe is planned but is subject to regulatory approval.A Mondelez spokesman said: “We’re excited about the launch of CaPao, which offers consumers a new range of plant powered snacks by making greater use of the cacao fruit. The products have been launched to start with in the US, but we will be looking to roll them out to other countries, including the UK, in the future.”Last year, Barry Callebaut launched ruby chocolate, a pink blend with a berry flavour that has been used in Nestle’s KitKat bars. The ruby chocolate KitKat was launched last year in Japan and Korea, followed by the UK, Europe and the US. Ruby chocolate – a fourth chocolate variant after traditional dark, milk and white – attracted huge interest from chocolate connoisseurs throughout the world since it was first revealed in September 2017. It is now on sale in more than 50 countries, under 75 brands.Pablo Perversi, chief innovation, sustainability and quality officer at Barry Callebaut, said: “Our goal is to develop innovations that are on trend, satisfy unmet consumer needs and taste great. This will respond to the needs of millennials and centennials for ‘healthy indulgence’. By using more of the cacao fruit and wasting less, we are having a positive impact on the planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bc961e8ae4365da627dca80236947d3ffaf8c86/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=710058099151681dd8110331eef8e9d0","title":"brexit apocalyptic radical new ideas progressive thinking","story":"Who would now dare to find hope in among the Brexit nightmare? Halloween is just a month away, and there is still no sign of any breakthrough in negotiations. The Conservative party is dealing in dangerous rightwing populism, a development that looks all the more abject because its new leader has taken this turn solely in the interests of his own career.The idea that an election could end the mess is undermined by wildly uneven polls, many of which have pointed to another hung parliament. And after his behaviour in the Commons last week and lack of contrition since, the prospect of Boris Johnson somehow agreeing some kind of compromise deal and getting it through parliament with the help of Labour MPs now looks like a fantasy. If you want a vision of the future, imagine an upper-class voice yelling, “Get Brexit done” for ever, as the paralysis and failure deepens.Last week I was at the Labour party conference, where Brexit was a reliable source of angst and ision, and the often rancorous atmosphere regularly suggested yet more impending doom. But I also started to feel pangs of optimism, and a renewed sense of something too often overlooked: the fact that our national meltdown is full of political complexities and that amid the mess, there are also the stirrings of a politics that might eventually answer the 21st century’s challenges.The list of policies announced and adopted in Brighton cohered around a central spine of ideas that were much bolder than the party’s 2017 manifesto. There was a Green New Deal with a 2030 zero-carbon target John McDonnell’s proposals for a four-day working week and set of universal basic services and plans for a state-owned pharmaceuticals producer, the abolition of private education and a new national care service.Whether these will make it into a manifesto is an interesting question, but when proceedings were at their most exciting there was a sense of an embryonic leftwing politics that might at last speak to a future oriented around three key things: the roots of inequality in society and the economy the upturning of life and work by technology and the need for a green approach to almost everything.In part, these were the result of hard work and creativity among a network of thinkers and policy wonks, and the kind of activists who are less interested in the bureaucratic grind of conference than the annual The World Transformed festival, which was once again full of energy and optimism. Some of the party’s new ideas reflect the radical environmentalism of Extinction Rebellion and the school strikes. But they also highlight the way the 2016 referendum has changed our politics in ways only just being understood.It is easy to forget that the vote for Brexit was initially taken as being about much more than Europe, on both left and right. Jeremy Corbyn explained what had happened in terms of “economic dislocation” and people being “betrayed and marginalised by successive governments”, themes he has repeated ever since. Not long after, Theresa May said that support for Brexit expressed many people’s belief “that the world works well for a privileged few but not for them” and that the biggest sacrifices after the crash had been made by “ordinary working-class families” – a view now being echoed in Johnson’s cynical trumpeting of the wonders of public spending.In addition, something even more game-changing has happened. Since 2016 Brexit has been transformed from the modest and endlessly beneficial readjustment promised by the pro-leave campaigners – £350m extra a week for the NHS, and all that – to a revolutionary project in which national harm might have to be accepted in pursuit of sovereignty. This change does not seem to have significantly affected levels of support for leaving the EU. To many people – me included – this might appear irrational. But it also calls time on the pre-referendum idea that politics can never be about big, radical ideas. If politicians can defy every ounce of political and economic common sense and insist we leave the EU, why should there be any limit on the kind of red-green ideas that we saw last week?This is not to say that success for the left is imminent. Standing in the way, obviously, is Brexit itself. Labour has arrived at a messy compromise that will send the party into an election advocating another public vote, while declining to say which side it will back. Whatever the logic of holding its base of support together and waiting for the outcome of new negotiations, Brexit-weary voters will feel wearier still at the prospect of having to vote again and devout leavers, in my experience, already see the drive for another referendum as tantamount to backing remain.Even if those problems can be set aside, if the party really wants to embrace a programme even half as thoroughgoing as the one hinted at in Brighton, it will need to ally with people, institutions and parties well outside the tent – something regularly thrown into doubt by the fact that to anyone looking in from the outside, Labour looks like a party struggling to get on with itself.As evidenced by yet another Corbyn speech that lacked a stirring, broad-sweep account of how Britain got into this mess and the national attributes that might get us out, the left’s eternal suspicion of anything that smells of patriotism means that its visions are too often expressed in a dry, mechanistic vocabulary that will never compete with the crass, emotional rhetoric we will hear from the Tories at their conference this week.The face Labour presents to the country is still sullied by a shrill self-righteousness, the weird stuff of leader-worship, and the sense that many energetic, outward-facing, essentially pro-European members are now in awkward alliance with some people who behave, procedurally and politically, as if it were 1974.But such is British politics. The big parties usually move in long and uncertain cycles, the old tends to get in the way of the new, and changes in thinking can take years to cohere. In Labour’s case, the long build-ups to 1945, 1964 and 1997 are all cases in point. For all Corbynism’s talk of a radical break from the party’s past, these tendencies are still ingrained – and in times like these, the party’s delay in getting its act together is maddening.But one of the ironies of our time is that Brexit has blown the lid off conventional notions of political possibility, allowing the left’s grassroots to start offering grounds for optimism. In the midst of all-enveloping darkness, that might provide just enough flickering light to keep us going."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58118c51853673ed6cf8f8e89c5b6b5df8718041/486_0_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5531b09b21bfdd2317ab711f9efdff56","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of brave","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘brave’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘brave’.Share your photos of what brave means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 October at 10am.

Naturally, my reflex is to look for a dock leafIt’s a feeling from childhood summers: a sickly, prickling spreading beneath the knee that sets hairs on end all over my body. It’s painful, in that severe but temporary way, like a mild electric shock. The sort of pain that makes you suddenly wary.In the woods, a cooler month has been caught by a surge of warmth – and beneath a canopy on the cusp of change, everything briefly thickens: the smells, the air, the green of the understorey. The nettles are everywhere, great armies of them, in identical ranks, anonymity in ubiquity. So numerous, they aren’t really noticed. Until you’re stung. Given the number, they are probably the most hazardous thing in the countryside.I bend down and examine my assailant. Somehow it has managed to sting me through my trousers: odd for something with such a frail, fur-like weaponry. The stings are on the stem and hairs underneath: each with a poison sac at its base. So brittle are they, they break off with a sideways brush, leaving a ragged edge sharp enough to pierce skin. Then poison you with formic acid. The body rounds out the discomfort with histamine.I wonder, is domination of the nettle linked to its peculiar protection-oriented potency? Overpopulation due to over-effective defence? Perhaps it’s fear of persecution from us. Boil the sting away and they’re nettle tea, nettle beer, pesto, soup, medicine. Even clothing, once: the Germans wore nettle-spun uniforms during the second world war. Ranks of a different sort.I couldn’t have nettle anything. The thought of any of it gives me goosebumps, a kind of Pavlovian pain association. But, somehow, it has been years since I’ve been stung.Another echo of childhood, my reflex is to look for a dock leaf. A kind of partner piece to the nettle, fond of similar environments. Placid and plate-like, an antithesis to the nettle’s malignant serrations. A folkloric cure, probably a placebo, but welcome. According to an old teacher of mine, you could always find one because nature likes to provide answers to the problems it creates.At least, use them well. Nettles shelter ladybirds, feed butterflies and deter predators from other plants.

Kaia Gerber, daughter of 90s supermodel Cindy Crawford, wore a satin bra top and black leather.After reading Allison Yarrow’s 2018 book 90s Bitch: Media, Culture and the Failed Promise of Gender Equality, Waight Keller found herself looking differently at that decade. “The book made me realise how sexualised women were in that era, and how little we recognised that at the time – and how what happened then led to where we are now. The fashion of that era is so raw. You had a slip dress on, a bra top – you were almost naked.”Waight Keller wanted to revisit the era but with a more enlightened outlook of “liberated femininity”. Hemlines became longer, fabrics got tougher. “More armoured,” as the designer put it backstage. A modern sensibility prompted Waight Keller to source surplus 90s jeans languishing in a warehouse outside Paris, and upcycle them into this season’s denim. A jeans revival is emerging as a theme at this Paris fashion week, after Hedi Slimane’s Celine collection gave a starring role to 1970s style flares.Earlier on Sunday there were many strange things about Balenciaga’s catwalk show. The inflatable puffer jackets, which swelled high above the shoulders to give models the silhouette of Gru from Despicable Me. There was also a lurid blue stage set inspired by the European parliament and credit cards were worn as earrings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf8d9654b88604619130b84c163c4e7d2891da40/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=422b67804620080ae13dd229b500e475","title":"west ham tottenham womens super league match report","story":"A stunning Rianna Dean header and a birthday goal for Lucy Quinn either side of half-time gave the promoted Tottenham a surprise victory at the London Stadium.“Disappointed, frustrated, deflated. It’s really hard,” said the West Ham captain, Gilly Flaherty. “I said at the start, you don’t want to come here to a stadium like this and remember it as the time you got beat by Spurs and that’s happened.“Just under 25,000, on a day where the weather was like our performance – rainy, sunny, rainy? For that amount of fans to come out and support us, it’s gutting we couldn’t get the result.”If they were hoping the Hammers would put on a winning show in front of an impressive crowd of 24,790 – beating the 24,564 at Stamford Bridge on the opening weekend, but behind the record-setting 31,213 at the Etihad Stadium – Tottenham’s team sheet will have buoyed them.The influential Gemma Davison, having picked up a knock in training, was ruled out of the fixture and, bizarrely, the pacy right-back Ashleigh Neville – arguably Tottenham’s player of the season – began the game on the bench.However, the Tottenham managers, Karen Hills and Juan Amoros, were full of praise for balance and depth of their squad. “The girls were outstanding and thoroughly deserved it,” Hills said.“The girls are learning from experiences. We’ve only been together a very short amount of time. The experienced players lead but the younger ones are really relishing the opportunities to play in the big games and they’re holding their own.”West Ham’s decision to host the derby here was a logical progression from the forward-thinking women’s team but the manager, Matt Beard, said that perhaps the occasion affected them.West Ham began brightly but were wasteful. It was the slick combination of Rosella Ayane and Dean that would silence the home crowd. The former whipped a cross in from the left as Dean wriggled between the centre‑backs, Flaherty and Laura Vetterlein, to send a stunning, powerful header into the bottom-right corner.After the break West Ham fought for the leveller. A mistake from an influential Filbey presented Alisha Lehmann with the ball on the edge of the area, she squared selflessly to Martha Thomas, who had a better angle, but her shot was saved by the excellent Becky Spencer.“Becky Spencer, I wanted to throw her in the stands,” Flaherty said with a laugh. “She was annoying me with her time-wasting but that showed her experience.”With the clock ticking down they continued to have the edge, the substitutes Kenza Dali and Jacynta Galabadaarachchi exchanging passes before the latter shot inches wide of the left post. Thomas then sidefooted wide from six yards out with the goal gaping.With West Ham looking nailed on to score next, Spurs caught them napping at the back. A deep free-kick from the left was poorly cleared and Quinn, recruited from Birmingham in the summer, sent the ball flying in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c98bba2d2b3c480d74a994c3edf7af48a688f1ff/0_154_4605_2763/master/4605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53819f6dda232d64e64dffa355de33c8","title":"arsenal edge manchester united old glory","story":"This fixture used to revolve around the likes of Vieira, Keane and Keown as both sides have work to do to be title contendersIt caused a flutter of interest last week when Arsène Wenger was quoted referring to the manager’s position at Manchester United as a “dream job”. He had apparently outlined his old foes’ failings in some detail while admitting “I have ideas” when it comes to any potential vacancy at Old Trafford. As it happened, Wenger had made no such comments during a broadcast interview in which his actual observations were considerably more moderate. Somebody had completely made them up and, in a parable for these times, undue haste in places that should know better ensured the nonsense quickly spread.The rush to inform the world that the former Arsenal manager had dangled vaguely provocative remarks in relation to United told of something else, too. Where there would once have been a queue of protagonists capable of fanning the flames before this fixture, the most expedient way to set pulses racing before Monday night’s meeting was to stir controversy through voices from the past.“On Monday at eight o’clock, in all the world, if someone wants to watch a game of football it’s this one,” said a current participant, Unai Emery, last week. He was right in one way, because it does not clash with any other game in a major league. But anyone still tuning in for the spit and snarl of the 1990s and 2000s – the bust-ups involving Schmeichel, Wright, Keane, Vieira, Keown, Van Nistelrooy, Fàbregas, a pizza buffet, Wenger and Ferguson – will be short-changed. This used to be the perfect Premier League rivalry: a showdown between high achievers from London and the north-west who, deep down, knew they had more in common than anyone would admit. Nowadays, viewers coming in from the cold would require a history lesson to ascribe any real gravitas to what they are watching.There are, at least, plenty of similarities this time just nothing anyone would crow to their established rivals about. Both clubs finished outside the top four last season, the second time that has happened in three years there are question marks over both managers, still trying to rebuild after being dealt questionable legacies by their famous predecessors both must grub around in the Europa League for their continental gratification and neither has yet made a compelling case for a return to the top level next season.Thirteen years have passed since Arsenal last won a league game at United’s home and they have tended to let them off the hook there of late. Last season the hosts were deep into the end times of José Mourinho’s reign but the London side, despite going ahead twice, failed to see out a game riddled with mishaps. Most of their visits since the 8-2 capitulation in 2011 have at least been hard-fought but Arsenal’s arrival has broadly become a pick-me-up: an occasion on which United can persuade themselves they have the number of a fellow pretender to the elite.It means United’s distressing injury list may yet prove less of a hindrance than any mental block Arsenal have developed. But it is doubtful that, under Wenger or Emery, the away side have come up against a weaker Old Trafford adversary than the one Ole Gunnar Solskjær will send out. They have a clear opportunity to shake off their hoodoo and, in the process, distance themselves from those comparisons of mediocrity. Even if Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial were fit, there is plenty to suggest Arsenal have better players – or players of greater potential – than United in most areas. Mason Greenwood is an exception to the latter but it would be a tall order for him to repeat the impact Rashford had when Arsenal visited in February 2016, scoring twice on his Premier League debut.A callow Rashford’s fortunes that day added to the lore of Arsenal being an obliging visitor. This season Emery’s team have been fun, their frailties compensated for by the clinical brilliance of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and – in recent weeks – the wild-eyed tenacity of Mattéo Guendouzi. But the head coach’s strategy is hardly obvious and there is a sense that a weekly white knuckle ride is not exactly the way he would rather have it. Whatever plan Solskjær has for United is little clearer: the Norwegian’s appointment was largely predicated on the fanbase’s vast reserves of goodwill for their old hero, an advantage Emery has not been able to enjoy in struggling to establish a rapport at the Emirates, but his reign’s early exuberance was soon weighed down by question marks.It was Arsenal who warned, four days after United’s spirited but streaky win at Paris Saint-Germain in March, that Solskjær’s magic might have limits when they won 2-0 at home. Granit Xhaka was one of the scorers and the debate over his selection as Arsenal captain seems light years from the era when Solskjær and Freddie Ljungberg – an increasingly visible presence alongside Emery in Arsenal’s technical area – would take their lead from Keane and Vieira. Neither set of fans would have dreamed of jeering their own skipper from the field, as happened to Xhaka last weekend against Aston Villa, back then, but the context and personalities surrounding this fixture have changed beyond recognition.“Will they emulate what Giggs, Scholes, Beckham did over the years? Personally I’m not convinced,” Wenger said of United’s current crop in quotes that, this time, were incontrovertibly his. Even the most one-eyed regular at Old Trafford might agree. Anyone seeking to set fires raging around this year’s encounter with Arsenal is left flailing for ways to get the old feeling back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9af272e10e6cfe1df26139ff83fc45d6f2b3a9a8/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=738619a29a9b28b471c0845e0307ddcc","title":"premier league 10 talking points from weekend action","story":"Fernandinho a cause for concern, Chris Wilder’s tough love for Dean Henderson and Brendan Rodgers ready for LiverpoolOn current form there are, at a rough count, at least three teams from the established “top six” that could benefit from the services of John McGinn. With the exception of Kevin De Bruyne it is hard to find a midfielder in better form and he certainly deserved to be on the winning side here, when Aston Villa were eventually pegged back by Burnley. “He’s been consistently good in all our performances and consistently looks like he’s going to score goals,” said McGinn’s manager, Dean Smith, after he volleyed in Villa’s second having earlier had a strike ruled out by VAR. “He’s an all-action player, gets into the opposition box, scores goals, wins free-kicks.” McGinn has an unorthodox running style but seems to cover every blade of grass while offering a constant creative threat: his rise has been quite something and the list of admirers will surely be growing. Nick AmesAfter scoring seven goals in three games Tammy Abraham has none in his past three outings for Chelsea. He struggled in the defeat by Valencia in the Champions League, lost a battle of wits with Adrián when he went through against Liverpool last week and had a frustrating afternoon in the win over Brighton on Saturday, spurning several opportunities in both halves. Instead of dwelling on the misses, however, let us focus on the positives. For a start Abraham has the knack of getting into goalscoring positions. But what of his ability to lead the line? It is not enough for a striker to be a mere poacher these days. They have to work for the team and Abraham showed he is improving in that area against Brighton, whose defenders struggled to live with his pace, strength and intelligence. His finishing might have been off but he did not have a bad game. Jacob SteinbergIn a season when clean sheets have been something of a rarity, Crystal Palace’s three from seven matches – the joint-highest along with West Ham and Manchester City – is a testament to their defensive strength in depth. Gary Cahill has proved to be a shrewd acquisition for the club, while Mamadou Sakho, James Tomkins, Martin Kelly and Scott Dann give Roy Hodgson several options at the back. The manager said: “It’s a great pity that we don’t have quite that luxury in other areas which I think would help us enormously if we had that. But I’m still hoping from the club’s point of view I hope that can be put right in January.” Having previously struggled at Selhurst Park, Palace are on their longest unbeaten home run since 1993 but face City, Leicester and Liverpool in their next three. Ed AaronsSince he arrived at Manchester City Fernandinho has received almost universal praise, but he was twice at fault for Everton’s equaliser. Playing as a centre-back in Pep Guardiola’s makeshift defence, the Brazilian fluffed an attempted clearance of Gylfi Sigurdsson’s cross then put in a weak tackle on Alex Iwobi to allow Séamus Coleman to set up Dominic Calvert-Lewin. He is a superbly combative and elegant midfielder, whose ability to control midfield and protect the defence has been as fundamental to City’s success as Kevin De Bruyne’s artistry or Sergio Agüero’s ruthlessness, but he is quite simply not a defender. City have been unlucky that injuries have struck down Aymeric Laporte and John Stones but square pegs in round holes will not cut it. Not with Liverpool in this form. Rob BleaneyWell, there is no stopping Leicester. Presented with a tiring and vulnerable opposition, they went clean through Newcastle. Some teams may have relaxed at 3-0 but Brendan Rodgers’s men hammered away at the open door that was Newcastle’s defence and were not flattered by the margin of victory. Leicester are up to third place. Is that courtesy of a generous start to their fixtures? Maybe. They have taken one point from games at Old Trafford and Chelsea. Up next on Saturday is Liverpool, at Anfield, a game Leicester drew last season and one Rodgers will savour. Should he go on the front foot, he will want Jamie Vardy to hustle and hassle Virgil van Dijk and James Maddison to be fit. He did not face Newcastle but Rodgers said after this win his star turn in midfield should be in contention. He will dearly love that to be the case. Conrad LeachChris Wilder was unsympathetic towards Dean Henderson after the goalkeeper’s error provided Georginio Wijnaldum’s winner. He also conjured an odd image. “I am not going to put my arm around him and rub his head,” the Sheffield United manager said. Henderson may not be daunted – George Baldock described him as confident three times in swift succession – but Wilder hopes a reaction will not be required by a man the Blades deem a future England keeper. “He made a huge one last year against Leeds and came back and he made a couple in a high-profile Championship game against Aston Villa and came back but I don’t want him to make mistakes,” the manager said. “For all the top goalkeepers mistakes are very few and far between. He is an outstanding young goalkeeper but a lot will be down to how he takes it on. This is a big season for him. It is up to him how he develops.” Richard JollyOne of the criticisms of Tanguy Ndombele at Lyon was his goals output. In 66 Ligue 1 appearances for the club he scored once. He knew himself that he needed to be more productive at Tottenham and so a second goal in five Premier League games was something to be happy about. What caught the eye about the midfielder’s performance against Southampton were the traits that convinced Spurs to part with a club-record fee of £55m in the summer – the driving, direct runs past opponents and the quick, incisive passes and flicks to get his team moving. These are early days and Ndombele needs more time to come to terms with the remorselessness of English football but he showed on Saturday that the raw materials are there. The search for consistency will define his season. David HytnerLet us talk about Adama Traoré again. The Wolves player is a source of fascination for many, partly because of his heritage – he grew up in Barcelona’s La Masla – but also his natural attributes, particularly his searing pace. The question of how to maximise those abilities has come into extra focus this season after Wolves moved on some of their forward players, giving Traoré a more prominent role. At points he has played as a wing-back but in recent games Nuno Espirito Santo has switched to a 3-4-3 and Traoré is back in his favoured advanced position. Against Watford he was very effective but in a surprising way. Yes, there were exhilarating dashes down the wing and also those dribbled bursts of close control. But Traoré used another weapon, too – his passing was often excellent, with his pre-assist for Wolves’ decisive second goal the pick. Substituted late on, it was with a sense of job done.

Why, then, is the US psychic industry worth $2bn a year? Deep in the night of 29 January 2012, Fatih Ozcan had an unusual dream. Then 27, and a waiter in a Turkish restaurant in York, Ozcan dreamed he was holding “loads of cash” while standing in front of his boss. When he arrived at the restaurant for his 5pm shift the next day, he was impatient to speak with his employer. “I was saying: ‘Where is he? I need him.’ I was telling everyone I had to play the lottery with the boss,” Ozcan says. After two hours of pestering, Ozcan’s boss agreed to play. Two days later, the winning EuroMillions numbers were drawn – the pair won £1m.“I’ve had loads of dreams that have become true, but they were little things, like travelling somewhere or having a nice day,” he says. Ozcan was certain this dream was prophetic and that he and his boss would win money together, because a month earlier he prayed for wealth for the first time. “My boss and my colleagues didn’t believe it, but I believed it and that’s why I pressured him for hours.”Every month premonitions hit the headlines – from the (ironically predictable) claims of Uri Geller to the countless celebrities who claim they foresaw 911 (including Michael Caine, Christine Lampard and Richard Madeley). Like Ozcan, several lottery winners claim they predicted their wins. In May this year, a man in Australia and a woman in Maryland both won the lottery by choosing numbers that they say came to them in a dream.That same month, a woman who lost her fiancé in the 2017 London Bridge terror attacks told an inquest about the moments before his death. Walking towards the Shard on the warm June evening, Christine Delcros suddenly felt uneasy as they neared the bridge and begged her partner to turn back. “We shouldn’t go there, we should go somewhere else,” she recalled saying. Tragically, her fiancé was the first of eight people killed in the attack.The Wikipedia page for “precognition” is unforgiving off the bat, the world’s most popular information resource claims premonitions are “widely considered to be pseudoscience”. This doesn’t change the fact that many of us have a similar story – a sense of unease before an accident, a familiar unfamiliar place, a disconcerting jolt of déjà vu.In 1967, Dr John Barker set up the London Premonitions Bureau to formally allow people to record their visions. It was the subject of a New Yorker article earlier this year. He collected many remarkable stories: shipwrecks, floods and tornadoes predicted in advance. A year after launching the bureau, two people even predicted the doctor’s own death – he died of a brain haemorrhage in August 1968. Yet 60 years later, the most accepted explanation of precognition is that we suffer from cognitive biases, retroactively seeking patterns to make sense of a senseless world. Still, like Barker, many continue to formalise the power of premonitions – and even hope to profit from the process.Dr Julia Mossbridge, a visiting psychology scholar at Northwestern University in the US, and co-author of The Premonition Code: How Sensing the Future Can Change Your Life, says there is an ever-expanding “precog economy”, where people with alleged precognitive powers sell their abilities to business people, law-enforcement officials and even health professionals.“People who are good at this can make money from it, and people who want the services can buy them for all sectors of the economy,” says Mossbridge, who had her first precognitive dream (about a school friend losing her watch) when she was seven. She says her so-called “positive precogs” (named after the mutated humans who predicted the future in the 2002 thriller Minority Report) differ from psychics with crystal balls and £1.50min phone lines. “What I’m imagining is a much more sophisticated and structurally supported version of that,” she says. “The UN could have a group of precogs who’d work on climate change alongside experts in the area. They’re just one mode of knowing.”Mossbridge’s dreams for a precog economy are undoubtedly ambitious, particularly as the scientific community considers precognition to be pseudoscience. “If I had to bet money on it, I would bet against the existence of these abilities based on my judgment of the currently available evidence,” says Professor Christopher French, head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths University. Yet French isn’t the one betting money. It is ordinary people who are paying precog businesses for stock market predictions and gambling tips. Mossbridge notes that psychic services have been growing since the recession and estimates the US psychic industry is worth $2bn. “Once precognition hits the higher-end markets – governments, investment banking – the estimates will go up by an order of magnitude,” she says.Daz Smith is a 49-year-old from Bath who works for an American business, CryptoViewing, to predict cryptocurrency trends. He says more than 20,000 subscribers pay a monthly fee (on a tiered structure starting from $1) to access insights from five precogs. Anyone can apply to work for CryptoViewing – to be eligible, you simply have to prove yourself by providing information about a faraway, unknown target the company sets.“The typical way I do it is I sit down at a table with a stack of paper and a pen, put my headphones on and meditate,” explains Smith. “It’s generally classical music, because it has no words and I don’t want to be influenced.” At the moment, Smith is listening to the soundtrack from the 2014 sci-fi film Interstellar. It takes him an hour to gather information. He says he sees “vague visuals” and feels snippets of emotions that he scribbles down on the page.Michael D Austin is the founder of Soul Rider, a California business that offers financial forecasting to clients. He assesses “signals” from his team of precog “viewers” in conjunction with traditional market analysis. “If eight people say the markets are going to go up and two people say the market is going to go down, you make a decision based on both experience and intuition.” His clients include inventors, stakeholders and entrepreneurs.“It’s been extremely helpful for me,” says Andrea Driver, a 50-year-old from Sacramento who has been using Soul Rider’s services for a year. Earlier this year, Austin advised her against purchasing a piece of land for her business – it later emerged there were permit issues with the location. “Having him tapping into that, precogging that, was very helpful.” It is easy to be sceptical of psychic claims. At one point during our call, Austin says he has “a feeling there’s a reason you opted to write this story”. Er, yes, I say sheepishly, I was commissioned by an editor.Both Austin and Smith also say they don’t want to use their powers to become millionaires themselves. Yet Caroline Watt, a parapsychologist at the University of Edinburgh, says studies have found a “small” but “statistically significant” precognitive effect in humans. “I know that sceptical scientists would argue it is not possible to look into the future, therefore it is obviously nonsense when a study claims a positive effect,” she says. However, Watt says there are some well-controlled studies that are hard to explain. She cites a 1989 meta-analysis of 309 “future-telling” studies conducted on 50,000 subjects between 1935 and 1987. The analysis concluded that “evidence for an overall effect is strong.” In 2016, researchers from the University of New South Wales found that “non-conscious emotional information” enables us to make better decisions – in short, intuition exists. If it’s accepted we subconsciously gather hidden information from our surroundings, is precognition a possibility?Despite this evidence, Watt warns that people shouldn’t put much stock (or shares) in the precog economy. “I would say it is a form of gambling because, although there may be a tiny effect, it’s not something of much practical use. The odds might be 1 in 1,000. I wouldn’t bet my house or my health on that.”Mossbridge is an optimist. While she agrees with Watt’s “small but statistically significant” framing, she believes further research is needed. “Scientists never used to be able to study meditation, because it was seen as too ‘woo woo’, but then people meditated and reduced stress, so now studies get funded,” she says. “That’s the way it always works – science is the last to jump on the bandwagon.”If science is last, then the military is first. Many precogs don’t just look into the future, Smith and Austin both use a technique known as “remote viewing” to explore distant targets in the present and the past. In 1995, the CIA declassified documents related to a secret army project, Stargate, that spent $20m researching remote viewing for 20 years, from the 1970s onwards. The files concluded that “remote viewers can be used as collectors in conjunction with other intelligence sources”. A major success came in 1976, when a remote viewer named Rosemary Smith found the location of a lost Soviet spy plane (in 1995, former president Jimmy Carter confirmed the incident had taken place). Yet Ray Hyman, a psychology professor tasked by the CIA to evaluate Stargate, wrote of consistent methodological problems, concluding there was little evidence remote viewing worked, let alone that it was useful in intelligence operations.Gail Husick, 55, is a former partner in a law firm who founded a remote-viewing agency in Washington in 2014. Among other things, the Husick Group has helped the police with missing-person cases, found a lost passport, searched for stolen art and advised an entrepreneur on technology patents. Fees begin at $3,000.Tim O’Brien, 61, is a Microsoft employee from Seattle who was adopted as a child and employed Husick to help find his birth mother. Over several months, Husick produced a 25-page report that O’Brien says gave “very, very intimate” details about his mother that she later confirmed to be true. O’Brien says these details include the fact that his mother worked in a mercantile environment and is very short, and that O’Brien’s conception was non- consensual and distressing. “I’m a firm believer that it wasn’t just lucky guessing.” O’Brien found his mother a year after Husick’s report – but not because of it. “They tried to pinpoint the town and were inaccurate,” he says, adding this “caused an unnecessary side-track” in his journey. Yet he has no regrets, and recommends remote viewing to others. “I think it’s a valuable tool.”Husick offers to conduct a remote-viewing session for me. I choose a location – a small hut-like pagoda on the northwestern corner of Nami Island, a micronation in South Korea where my boyfriend proposed to me earlier this summer.Husick used 13 remote viewers for the task and then sent me her report. I was initially unimpressed by the results. The viewers saw “a curved structure” that resembled a pit or an amphitheatre, there was reference to tiered seating, and Husick’s report mentioned a tunnel, mine, or shaft. “There is a sense of intense desire, danger, threat, aggression and competition associated with the target location,” the report reads, somewhat insultingly.When I tell Husick the viewing failed, she is unperturbed. “I understand your initial reaction. Most people expect us to be like psychics in the movies and the reality is that our work is much more painstaking,” she says. She explores Nami Island on Google and finds several consistencies with the viewers’ visions. She points out that several viewers spoke of a tower-like feature near the target location – a zipwire runs from the mainland to the island. The report shows that Viewer 12 saw “multiples of human males rappelling downwards suspended by rope-like cords”. Husick adds that, although I didn’t see it, there is cascaded seating on the island – in a garden area – and it’s adorned with flags, just as one viewer drew. She explains that if I were a real client, multiple sessions would have been undertaken, and this report is just a “first pass” at the target.Husick considers our session a success I remain confused. The viewers’ results are over 200 pages long. For every result that makes me gasp (Viewer 12 drew a structure that looks remarkably like my pagoda), another dampens my mood (one viewer saw an “industrial wasteland” and “urban decay” – the island is lush and green, and peacocks wander freely).Should I put stock in Husick’s consistencies? Professor French says a cognitive bias known as “subjective validation” means people consider information correct if it has personal value to them (he notes that no one is immune and, thanks to his career, he himself has a vested interest in being a sceptic). “How do we know that those correspondences didn’t just occur by chance? In 200 pages, there’s bound to be elements that match any location you go to,” he says.Yet Mossbridge argues it’s still a growing business. “There are more and more people who are building applications of this work. Some are legitimate and some are not, but they’re getting customers who are buying their work for reasonable and sometimes exorbitant prices, which means that the sceptics are not winning.” It’s worth noting that those who do buy into the precog economy don’t like to publicise the fact. Austin, Husick and Smith all say that police forces who work with them prefer to keep quiet about it, and Austin believes the precog economy will have to stay on the “downlow” as it expands. “It scares people,” he says. “It scares the hell out of them.”Winning the lottery after a precognitive dream was the least remarkable part of Fatih Ozcan’s story. The waiter only found out he’d won nine days after the draw, because his boss kept the ticket and refused to halve the winnings. After protracted police proceedings, Ozcan took him to court. It was a distressing time – telling the story makes his voice shake. “People were telling me I had no chance of winning the court case,” he says. Yet midway through his ordeal, he received reassurance in the middle of the night. “I had another dream showing me I would win the case,” he recalls.

Last week, two low-caste children caught defecating outside were lynched.The programme was launched in 2014 and sparked a flurry of toilet-building – more than 100m in five years. Politicians and Bollywood stars have participated in huge government publicity campaigns to promote the scheme, and children in rural schools have marched around villages singing about the public health benefits of eliminating open defecation. Numerous government and independent studies show that open defecation has dramatically declined.But the programme has been dogged by criticism of overzealous government workers, volunteers and vigilantes using coercive tactics to help the government’s effort.An Indian news channel reported that the children – a 12-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy – killed last week in Madhya Pradesh lived in a small hut without a toilet in a village that was declared open-defecation free in April last year.The mother of one of the children told India Today “They were defecating in the open and that’s why they were killed.”A researcher who worked on the study said it was “unlikely” that toilet usage had increased dramatically since the report was released, since local government officials have spent much of the past few months organising India’s elections, which took place in May.More than half of interviewees for the independent study said the programme had led to abuse. A report listed a number of alarming incidents. One video showed a woman screaming as she was dragged into a car by village “motivators”. Another showed men holding their ears and doing sit-ups surrounded by police officers and government staff as a punishment for openly defecation. The study also listed local news reports documenting attacks against open defecators, and showed hoardings in one district that warned: “If you defecate in the open, you will soon get death.”Sangita Vyas, a research fellow at the Rice Institute, said: “For Swachh Bharat to have made huge progress, they would have needed to address caste hierarchies and beliefs in purity and pollution. We found that it seems to have exacerbated caste hierarchies. Sanitation is used as a method for elite groups to suppress marginalised communities.”Concerns were also raised in a report last year by the UN special rapporteur for safe drinking water and sanitation, Leo Heller. “As an unintended consequence of the desire to obtain rewards, including the title of ‘open-defecation free’, some aggressive and abusive practices seem to have emerged,” he wrote.Heller reported that “iniduals defecating in the open are being shamed, harassed, attacked or otherwise penalised,” and that accused open defecators faced being denied food rations, or having their electricity disconnected.Heller also noted the Indian government “recognised the existence of abuse associated with the Clean India mission implementation and issued at least two advisories to all states underlining that such practices must stop”.Despite rapid economic strides in past decades, India has lagged behind other countries on sanitation. Academics have argued that the practice of open defecation has survived because cleaning toilets is considered low caste work in India.The killings of the two children in Madhya Pradesh occurred hours after Modi received an award in New York from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the Clean India programme. News of the award was met with protests and has reinvigorated debates about the role western governments and philanthropic organisations have played in boosting Modi’s profile.It led one Gates Foundation employee, Sabah Hamid, who worked in the organisation’s India office, to resign in protest. Speaking to the  about her decision, Hamid said she was “incredulous” when she learned about the award. “It seemed contrary to everything the foundation works on and claims to believe in,” she said.During the award ceremony, a map of India projected on to a screen turned green, showing that the country was due to become open defecation free by 2 October. A video that played on stage flashed up a quote from India’s founding father, Mohandas Gandhi, saying: “Sanitation is more important than political independence.”The Gates Foundation did not respond to requests for comment, but has previously said: “Before the Swachh Bharat mission, over 500 million people in India did not have access to safe sanitation, and now, the majority do. There is still a long way to go, but the impacts of access to sanitation in India are already being realised.”An email sent to India’s foreign and home ministries went unanswered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c79d45727e67936ab626bc8acb3a3342937a4d4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ebb04f18c469bb578b5f93e433002d3","title":"the mine clearing women of angola in pictures","story":"Photographer Antonio Olmos visited the village of Cabio in Benguela Province to document the work of the women of the Halo Trust who are clearing the anti-personnel mines left over from the Angolan civil war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8acbb072dc1237e888b919cf8de870fd57d54be9/0_464_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d66a3fbb1fe46482ae63b5484310c95","title":"british history can be clearly seen through spectacles","story":"Cubitts founder Tom Broughton on the story of eyewear in BritainI’m fascinated by spectacles because I’m a consumer of the product. I’ve worn them from a young age and they’re an indelible part of who I am. I’ve always liked them. My dad wore glasses too, and I remember for family photos he’d take them off whereas I’d put mine on. What amazes me is that although over two in three need spectacles, very few people know the story of them.The business of spectacles comes from the Enlightenment. Sir Isaac Newton was looking at refraction of light in the late 1600s. In 1704 he wrote a book called Opticks when he was living on Jermyn Street, London, and that paved the way for different industries including the invention of microscopes and telescopes, and the optical lens industry was another child of that moment. The industry blossomed, with key proponents including Edward Scarlett, who made the first frames in 1727, and John Dollond, who was the son of a Huguenot silk weaver who moved to Spitalfields from France during the persecution. He joined the Spitalfields Mathematical Society, who used to meet in a pub, get pissed on mead and talk about numbers. He made the world’s first achromatic lens and set up the first opticians – Dollond \u0026amp Aitchison – turning spectacles from a matter of pure science into a consumer proposition. In 1750, when the first opticians were set up, life was pretty shit. Life expectancy was 38. Glasses were seen as academic, scholarly and scientific, and they were extremely expensive, though in the early 19th century they expanded from scientific to affluent communities – and the materials used changed accordingly. Glasses were originally made from steel but that extended to rolled gold, tortoiseshell and horn. In came the lorgnette, invented in 1785 by George Adams, for wealthy ladies to whip out at the theatre. The early 1900s were the golden age of optics. Glasses could be produced more cheaply and the cost came down but they were still the preserve of relative affluence. Your glasses would be the most expensive thing you owned and your most treasured possession. As a consequence, there was an industry of repair. Timpsons shoe repair used to mend spectacles alongside shoes.The seismic moment was in 1948 when the National Health Service was established. One of its key pillars was taking spectacles to the masses. They went from being the preserve of people who could go to Clerkenwell to spend a small fortune on spectacles to being given to anyone who needed them, for free, by the state.That scheme was unprecedented: nothing had been attempted like that before in the world. Sight is still a major problem – more than 2 billion people worldwide don’t have access to glasses.It also had a huge impact on the industry. At the start of the second world war there were 200-300 different workshops across Britain making bespoke and small-run stuff. The NHS offered seven shapes of frames, and 5m frames a year. The workshops that got the NHS contacts thrived and everything else shut or combined. By 1986, when the NHS stopped offering free glasses to all, there were three companies which had the NHS contracts knocking out these stock agreed frames. Two of these three went out of the business. The third – called The Algha Works – managed to survive. They went back to traditional premium materials such as rolled gold. At their peak they employed 500 people now they employ seven.This has all left us with a peculiar relationship with glasses. British standards in optics are still stringent. We have dispensing opticians if you wander the streets of Paris you see beautiful little shops that sell glasses whereas in Japan you put your head in a machine which uses autorefractors and prints your prescription off. But the NHS scheme meant that glasses became seen as a medical device and the frames weren’t designed to look nice but to find the smallest number of frames that could fit the maximum number of heads. So spectacles became derided. When I was at school the stigma associated with them was huge. They were a sign you didn’t have money or style. I grew up in Leicester and I was exposed to a new world when I came across the brand Cutler \u0026amp Gross. When I started working and received my first pay cheque I got a pair of their frames sent up from London. It was a big deal and there was an unveiling at the opticians. The more you find out about the history of British optics, the more you realise how incredible it is. Spectacles touch on so many things – they enable your vision, they’re about manufacturing, design, phrenology, optics, materiality. The story is intoxicating.Tom Broughton is the founder of Cubitts spectacle makers "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7365ba500de146ce19920de5b639f5ace60bc5d4/0_73_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd523d9f79e9c37a57afecab62f07c15","title":"graphic designer mirko borsche i want people to see from a different angle","story":"He’s stamped his style on everything from Nike to the newspapers. Here, graphic designer Mirko Borsche explains why print will survive, how ugly lines work and why he’s destined to failIt’s just about big balls. Very simple. We are working in an industry where the marketing department gives the lead to designers, even to journalists – what they have to write, how they have to spell it, the trigger words – my opinion is that it’s because people who run brands have lost their balls completely.”It’s no surprise that German graphic designer Mirko Borsche has earned a reputation as something of a provocateur. His opinions are as attention grabbbing as his studio’s erse projects. Borsche and his team at Bureau Borsche has created websites and logos for fashion houses Balenciaga and Givenchy, and the acid-meets-classicism season guides and posters for the Bavarian State Opera. There’s also his award-winning work as creative director for newspaper Die Zeit, where Borsche has worked since 2007.Bureau Borsche has had a big year. In May the studio’s art commission for the Venice Pavillion at the Biennale contaminated the whole city with neon green idents. The art piece played to the biennale theme of fake news by stamping Borsche’s work on everything from flags to plastic bags, as if the artwork were a Venice logo. They also created the logotype for the high profile relaunch of style magazine The Face.Borsche misspent his youth as a graffiti artist in his native Munich (“bombing trains and walls influenced me a lot”) but went on to study graphic design at Kingston University, London, and the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg, Germany. After five years as an art director in advertising for clients including Levi’s, MTV and Mercedes-Benz, he co-founded the style magazine NEON and art directed Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin before launching his own graphic design studio in 2007. Bureau Borsche has operated out of his Munich HQ ever since. Though he enjoys the role of agitator Borsche hates designers with huge egos who impose their own aesthetic on brands – “the worst thing ever,” he insists.This is certainly true of the job he is perhaps best known for: his award-winning creative direction for German newspaper Die Zeit and its supplement, Zeit Magazin. Borsche’s design for the paper is classic and “humble” but allows for unexpected twists in the use of photography and typography “to provoke people or make them see things from a different angle”. By example, he cites the “very crappy illustrations” by Martin Fengel which feature on Harald Martenstein’s column.“He’s a photographer friend of mine,” he hastens to point out. “He’s not an illustrator at all, which you can see! But I just felt he had a really nice sense of humour and a way of telling things just with a few ugly lines – and it worked out really well.”He is full of praise for the “quite radical” editorial team who opted to invest in print when the rest of the world was heralding its demise. “It could have gone wrong but they said, ‘Our hero is the product, and if the product gets shitty we’re going to sell less’. And, what people don’t see when they say print is going to die is that, once the print product closes, the website is going to close too because it doesn’t make any money.”As for the logotype for The Face magazine, does he worry about upsetting original Face designer Neville Brody , one of the iconic figures of his industry? “The thing is, nobody’s going to like it anyway,” laughs Borsche. “So I didn’t really think about that. I just wanted to have the same aesthetic and feeling, but it’s quite hard to recreate that … editorial design is so much more developed today, so even if everyone remembers how brilliant The Face was, it can look a bit outdated now.’Perhaps surprisingly, he singles out Nike as one of his favourite clients in terms of attitude to branding. “People always say, ‘Oh Nike are so far ahead of us.’ You know why? Because Nike just trust the person they’re working with – they let you actually ‘Just do it’! If you say to them, ‘I think we should have no swoosh’, they say, ‘Yeah, OK. If that works out for that design, perfect.’ There’s not a lot of brands in the world that think that way. Apple used to be like that. If you look at European brands, most of them are still stuck in this 80s or 90s idea of marketing – you do the same things over and over again. And they haven’t realised that nobody – nobody – is interested in advertising any more.”"},{"url":null,"title":"the new alchemists could the past hold the key to sustainable living","story":"In 1982, Richard Buckminster Fuller visited the New Alchemy Institute, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to open a new geodesic dome. Frail of body but still sharp of mind, the 87-year-old architect was something of a countercultural guru by this stage, thanks to his “spaceship Earth” philosophy and his forward-looking designs, not least the dome.Lightweight, efficient, simple to construct and futuristic, domes became a hippy cliche in the 70s, but the New Alchemists’ dome was a little different. Designed by Fuller’s disciple Jay Baldwin, it was the first “pillow dome”: made of triangular panels of transparent plastic inflated with argon gas, which improved its insulation properties (the same technology is behind Cornwall’s Eden Project).Inside the pillow dome was a miniature forest of plants, tropical fish ponds and a ripening fig tree. Fuller nodded with approval. “He said, ‘She’s beautiful,’” recalls Nancy Jack Todd, co-founder of the New Alchemy Institute (NAI), along with her husband John. “He turned around and said to John with this happy smile: ‘This is what I’ve always wanted to see: my architecture with your biology.’ He called the work we were doing ‘the hope of the world’.”Founded in 1969, the NAI set out to design a sustainable way of living from top to bottom: food, energy and shelter. This was the era of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the Whole Earth Catalog (of which Baldwin was an editor). It was the era of anti-nuclear and anti-Vietnam war movements a time when huge numbers of people felt that modern society was on the wrong path, and better alternatives were possible. “I wouldn’t say we were on the same page as Bucky,” John Todd says, “but we came to the same conclusions. His basic message, about how to do more with less, really resonated with us.”The New Alchemists’ alternative was a harmonious system of organic farming, renewable energy, sustainable architecture, waste treatment and ecosystem restoration. No pesticides or chemicals, no fossil fuels, no waste, no pollution, low impact, energy efficient. In other words, they were doing 50 years ago what we’re now realising we should have been doing all along.Despite their long hair and countercultural leanings, the New Alchemists were not hippies they were scientists. John Todd, the driving force behind the NAI, is a marine biologist by training his wife Nancy is a writer and activist, and the third founding member, Bill McLarney, is a fish biologist. True, their large-format journals of the time have a quaint, radical vibe to them, with their intricate hand-drawn covers depicting unicorns and dragons. But alongside quotations from Tolkien and poems about mushrooms are reports on their experiments on the insect-resistance of certain cabbage varieties, diagrams of their low-tech wind turbines or progress reports on aquaculture techniques.Nor was the NAI a “commune”. It was a research project, the Todds explain people came there to work, not to play. At its peak, the NAI had around 30 members, aided by hundreds more temporary volunteers. Few actually lived on the site. There were no experiments in common ownership or free love. The Todds and their three young children lived in a small cottage a few miles away, where they still live today.“Socially, we agreed, the three of us founders, that we wanted to lead private lives,” Nancy says. “We felt that there were too many revolutions underneath it already without trying to do a social one as well.” Besides, John adds, “Being somewhat reserved Canadians, there is not a lot of gossip or juicy stories.”The catalyst for the NAI was frustration with academia, John says. In the late 60s, he and McLarney both began teaching at San Diego State University, where John was to head up a new department of environmental studies. He soon hit a wall of institutional inflexibility: “The idea of doing activities from various disciplines – energy, architecture, agriculture, waste water, you name it – was simply not possible within the university setting at that time. A number of people, who became very close friends, were coming to the same conclusion: that we had to find new institutional structures to go after a larger vision.”The Todds and McLarney quit academia, found new jobs at an oceanographic institute in Cape Cod and started to put their New Alchemist ideas into practice on a 12-acre plot of land. The first objective was agriculture. They set about improving the soil quality and planting food crops. They began breeding rabbits and digging fish ponds. McLarney introduced the then-unheard-of tilapia, an easily farmable fish. Other friends and colleagues came to join them. A 1973 film made by the National Film Board of Canada portrays the NAI as an Arcadian utopia: a lush, green world of healthy, happy people tending healthy, happy crops. They build wind turbines out of car parts and oil drums, swim in the pond, gather for communal outdoor meals, scavenge at the local dump and play guitars together in the sunset. It almost looks like a parody.The NAI’s approach was a combination of old-fashioned common sense and modern scientific method. Everything was monitored and recorded: weather conditions, soil chemistry, crop yields, numbers of midge larvae (used as fish food) growing in different qualities of water. Data was analysed, techniques were compared, processes were refined, until their organic yields exceeded those of industrial farms. But underpinning it all was John’s belief that natural systems could be duplicated, harnessed and harmoniously interlinked. The wind pumps the water, that waters the garden, that grows the carrots, that feed the rabbits, that fertilise the earthworms, that feed the fish, along with the carrot tops. And it all feeds the people. “Each time we make a connection, as in nature itself, the whole becomes more stable, more strong and more healthy,” John says in the film.In one significant, typically low-tech breakthrough, John began to experiment with 5ft translucent cylindrical water tanks – filling them with pond water and observing the miniature ecosystems that formed inside. As the tanks received more sunlight than a pond would, algae and other life grew much quicker. They were perfect for cultivating fish in (tilapia eat the algae). You could link them together and water would become progressively cleaner as it flowed from one to the next. You could grow vegetables hydroponically on their surface. Most importantly, the water heated up in the sun, so the tanks became an effective store of solar energy – “thermal flywheel”, as John puts it.The New Alchemists’ most ambitious structures were what they called “arks” – two experiments into the “shelter” aspect of their mission. Two young architects from Yale University, David Bergmark and Ole Hammarlund, led the design: one ark in Cape Cod and another on Prince Edward Island, Canada, thanks to a commission from the Canadian government.The Prince Edward Island ark, on a windblown promontory surrounded by the sea on three sides, was the New Alchemists’ architectural high point. We would recognise it today as a show-home for “off-grid” living, employing sustainable design principles that are now common practice but were nascent, untested technologies at the time. Aligned east-west, the Prince Edward Island ark was partly sunken into the earth on its north side, with sloping glazing along its south facade to capture maximum solar radiation. The south facade also featured a row of vertically aligned solar collectors (heating water rather than generating electricity – photovoltaic technology was nowhere near advanced enough yet). A prototype hydraulic wind turbine nearby covered the building’s electricity needs.The dominant space inside was a high-ceilinged greenhouse containing plant beds for growing vegetables, herbs, flowers and tree saplings. Lizards, newts, ladybirds and even a resident snake controlled insect populations. The ark also contained 32 of Todd’s “solar-algae tanks” – primarily for fish cultivation, but the tanks proved so effective at storing heat that the building’s other experimental climate systems became redundant. “We were growing bananas in January,” says Todd. When a winter storm caused a three-day power cut and buried the landscape in snow, the ark remained a stable temperature inside.About one-third of the ark was a home, where the Todds’ New Alchemist friend Nancy Willis and her family lived happily for a time, growing their own produce and managing the “living machine”. Though light and spacious, the ark was not the stuff of high-end design aesthetically, but it represented a potential new way of living – sustainable, self-sufficient, integrated with nature on an intimate scale. Shelter, food, energy. Perhaps a social revolution after all.The Prince Edward Island ark was opened in September 1976 by Canadian prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau (father of current PM Justin), who arrived by helicopter with much fanfare to find a bunch of dirty, exhausted New Alchemists who had completed the build hours before. Trudeau gave a stirring speech about how the ark was “the birth of the new philosophy” and told the Todds he would like to have a similar house for his own family. “Very close by was a nuclear plant,” Nancy recalls, “so I said to him, ‘All of this makes nuclear energy completely unnecessary, doesn’t it?’” Trudeau’s answer was noncommittal.The fate of the Prince Edward Island ark mirrors that of not only the NAI itself, but the whole sustainability movement of the 70s. Functionally, the building exceeded expectations. The hydraulic wind turbine proved to be a failure and the solar collectors leaked, but the “living machine” was alive and well, drawing visitors, spreading the sustainability gospel and growing enough vegetables and fish to sell surplus to local restaurants. But politically, the winds were changing. By 1981, their Canadian government allies were no longer in office and financial support dried up. After numerous rescue attempts, the ark was converted into a small hotel and restaurant in the early 80s. Around 2000, it was demolished.A similar change of sentiment hobbled the NAI in Cape Cod. During the 70s, it had been funded by a series of grants from the US government and private foundations. But as the Reagan era set in, those funds became harder to access. The sentiment became more “me” than “we”. The hippies cut their hair, abandoned their geodesic domes and found proper jobs. The NAI survived Reaganism, but much of its energy through the 80s went into merely staying afloat, rather than “pushing the vision”, as John puts it. It eventually dissolved in 1991.But the New Alchemists found other ways to push their vision. McLarney founded an offshoot of the institute in Costa Rica, named ANAI, which has transformed the country’s southern Caribbean coast and become a model for conservation and sustainable development. Architects Bergmark and Ole remained in the Prince Edward Island region practising sustainable design. The New Alchemists’ Cape Cod plot was turned into a co-housing project, complete with a refurbished ark.John Todd retreated from architecture and returned to his first love: water. Those experiments with solar-algae tanks put him on a path of environmental restoration, using natural systems to improve water quality and remove pollution. He realised a long time ago what the world is just beginning to realise now: that ecosystem restoration is key to stabilising the climate, and nature itself can help provide the answers. In 1982 the Todds founded a new initiative, Ocean Arks International, researching and applying this knowledge in multiple situations, from natural wastewater treatment to ocean-going eco-repair vessels to an ambitious project to re-green the Sinai desert (it even involves geodesic domes). It is a continuation of what the New Alchemists began, John says: “Doing good things in bad places.”Rather than feeling bleak about the future, he is surprisingly optimistic. He recently published a book called Healing Earth, part-autobiography, part-manual on how to save the world. Its opening line reads: “I am writing this book based on the belief that humanity will soon become involved in a deep and abiding worldwide partnership with nature.” Yes, the planet is in crisis, but rather than what the New Alchemists called “doomwatch science” – monitoring environmental decline – John Todd has always been focused on practical solutions. “The more we weave together the knowledge that’s been accumulated in the last 100 years, the more we can do things that we never dreamed of,” he says. “We don’t have to invent anything we just have to pay attention to what’s been learned.”A Safe and Sustainable World: The Promise Of Ecological Design by Nancy Jack Todd is available now (£25, Island Press).Living Lightly on the Earth: Building an Ark for Prince Edward Island 1974‑76 by Steven Mannell is available now (£30, Dalhousie Architectural)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20f920f5ed52e0403de8d4812f40b4c69dc83ba/449_312_917_550/master/917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e454c78ecc22cc87c41ec54937db71ce","title":"you never forget the first time how i lost my investment virginity","story":"Many of us have the sense that our money could be doing more than sitting in a savings account, albeit with some apprehension about what else to do with it. But for Danielle Graph, becoming a first-time investor was less scary than it seemedI’m a control freak. It isn’t my most endearing quality, but it does mean that when it comes to things such as life admin and money matters, I try to heed the girl scout motto and be prepared for every eventuality. But, for some reason, I’ve never tried investing before.I’m lucky enough to have a few work-based pensions, which will apparently provide me with a grand sum of £365 per month to help me heat my home and fill my shopping trolley, once I’m of retirement age. And because I’m constantly thinking and worrying about the future, whenever I’ve found myself with any financial headroom, I’ve been diligent about saving.At the moment, though, I’m finding that, week-by-week, I’m just getting by. I work for a website part-time and my husband is in the luxury goods market, which has been hit by the recent economic uncertainty. Plus, our cost of living just seems to keep on rising – our car, our kids’ after-school clubs, even our cats seem to be getting more expensive.So I’ve decided to try to improve our financial future by dipping my toe into the big wide world of investments. This is completely new territory for me. My only experience of investment pretty much extends to watching Damian Lewis in Billions. Indeed, when people tell me that they “invest”, I can’t help picturing a 1980s yuppie in pinstripes and braces, shouting “loadsamoney” into a brick mobile phone. Can this really be for me?I start researching investments online: the words float across the screen like a different language. I wonder to myself why I’ve never tried investing before? Perhaps it has something to do with my control-freak tendencies? And yet, deciding to invest actually feels like taking control. So, undeterred by some of the jargon I encounter online, I take £1,000 out of our stagnant savings and resolve to try and make it grow. Watch out Wall Street, this twice failing maths GCSE pupil is coming for you.No matter how much I psych myself up, however, the shameful truth is I still have no idea where to really begin. So I turn to my bank, HSBC, and phone its investment helpline. I kick off my chat with the super helpful specialist by asking her to explain everything as if she’s talking to a five-year-old. I tell her I have £1,000 to invest, where do I start? (Though it’s worth noting that you can start investing in some places from only £100.)For a Joe Average like me, the specialist explains that this isn’t some get rich quick scheme, but instead to think about this for the long term – at least a five-year timeframe. Mentally, I start planning a family holiday to Disney World five years down the line. She then checks that I’ve got an emergency fund in place for dealing with any unexpected expenses. Next, we chat about how I might make the best decision for me, where I’d feel most comfortable putting my money and about the various investment options that are available. I make notes – lots of notes. It’s a lot of information to absorb, but once I have the basics, I hang up the phone and bolster what I’ve just been told with information from HSBC’s website, where everything is clearly covered. Then I phone back the helpline with further queries. This approach seems to work best for me, and gives me the best of both worlds: the personal touch over the telephone, plus the chance to supplement what I learn in my own time and at my own pace. Helpfully, everything I’ve discussed with the specialist is available online, including a timely reminder that, when it comes to investments, I may not get back what I put in – along with a brilliant jargon buster which has found itself a special place in my bookmarks toolbar.I focus on three distinct investment options. The first involves opening an account to buy shares in inidual companies – companies whose shares are publicly traded in the stock market. I keep visualising shares as if they’re slices of one giant pizza – the publicly-traded companies get sliced into so many pieces, and you then can buy a slice, or a few slices. Of course, it would have to be the world’s biggest pizza given the sheer number of shares that are typically issued. Plus, it starts making me hungry. The second option involves putting your money into a fund-based investment. A fund is basically a group of investors who collectively put their money together in one basket, and that money is spread out, across a whole range of investments.Thirdly, you can invest in a portfolio, which is basically a collection of different funds.All of these options can also can be undertaken via a stocks and shares ISA (Inidual Savings Accounts). The benefits of an ISA are that you don’t pay income or capital gains tax on what you earn, but you are limited to a maximum of £20,000 investment per year. You can split your ISA allowance between stocks and shares, and cash – a cash ISA being similar to a savings account that offers instant access to your money. A stocks and shares ISA could potentially earn you more money than the alternative, however, there is a greater risk attached, as your money is invested in stocks and shares, which can go down, as well as up.As one of my cats peers over the top of my laptop, meowing for yet more food, she reminds me of all our day-to-day expenses and why I need to try and secure a better financial future for my family. Taking in two kittens from a cat shelter seemed like the best idea at the time, but I had no idea they’d bump up our monthly costs by a rather massive £100, for cat food, litter and insurance.Now that I’m armed with decidedly more knowledge than when I started, I brew a strong cup of Earl Grey, crack open a packet of shortbread and mull over how I want to lose my investment virginity. I decide I don’t want any additional tax worries (who does?) which is why I’m going down the ISA route. I’m also looking for an investment that doesn’t require any work on my part, which is why I opt for something HSBC calls a “managed” solution, which means they take care of managing my funds and keep me updated in regular statements. I choose a stocks and shares ISA which invests in funds, rather than the alternative which invests in shares on the stock market. For the final step, I go through an online process using HSBC’s My Investment tool, which involves answering multiple, intricate questions about my finances, assessing if I can afford to invest, and delving deeply into how I feel about risk. The depth of the questions reassures me rather than puts me off – and it’s been written in a plain, easy to understand language. The tool processes my answers and conclude that I’m a person who’s comfortable with risk – so I opt for the high risk portfolio it recommends.The cost of setting up my ISA is £7.50 with an estimated* £4.50 per annum account fee. It’s been surprisingly straightforward and I bask in the positive feeling of having taken some control over my money. In fact, when I log in to my online banking app moments later, there sits my ISA account, holding my £1,000. I take a mental picture of the moment. After all, you never forget your first time.To invest or access investment advice through HSBC you must be and existing HSBC UK current or savings account customer.

Are Britons planning enough?Everyone has different financial goals with different ultimate aims – from launching a business to buying a house to investing for a better retirement. But how many of us have the right structures and plans in place to actually reach them?Many of us leave planning for our future too late, even though our longer-term goals often require longer-term arrangements. In addition, we tend to put our cash into property instead of financial products, partly because of the cultural importance attached to home ownership in the UK – with getting a foot on to the property ladder widely viewed as a key milestone. Others buy property as an investment, which can generate a rental income and may grow in value. But we’ve also seen property prices fluctuate, which can affect short-term liquidity, so this needs to be carefully considered from every perspective.We hit the streets to find out about people’s financial goals and whether or not they had put in place plans to make those goals happen.Providing for family was a big priority for many. With the rising costs of obtaining a university degree, and less secure work prospects for the next generation, some are feeling less certain about their children’s futures. “My goal is to put my daughter through university and to pay for her education. She wants to study fine art and to do a foundation course initially, so that’s the biggest thing I’m funding at the moment. I do have a financial adviser who I see now and then, who has given me advice on the best way to invest. I have a plan in place – although I’m not sure how much it will cost exactly. As a self-employed worker, finances and pensions can be complicated, but I’ve been investing into a pension since my 20s. In hindsight I probably should have invested in property!”“As a nurse who has worked in A\u0026ampE for a long time, I’m all about living for the moment and spending time with loved ones. Financially, I am stable and have put money aside for my children if they need it. I also have a few months’ wages saved up, in case something breaks in the house. But that’s it – I don’t believe in making big goals and saving up for very expensive things I don’t need.”For more information about saving for your children, go to HSBC’s saving for children guideThe majority of the people we spoke to mentioned buying property and owning a flat or house as their primary goal. For many it seems to offer the security of housing, as well as a form of investment.“I’m about to move to Sweden and I’d like to buy a property there with my partner, which might be fairly expensive. My partner and I are savers, definitely. We already have the money saved up for the purchase and I don’t have any debt. I have only ever used my credit card for things like flights and tend to use cash a lot, to avoid spending unnecessarily. I used to shop a lot but that’s changed – I don’t want to be in debt and overpaying for things I don’t need.”“My goal is to get a mortgage, so I can finally get on the property ladder – but I was recently made redundant, which wasn’t on the cards. It wasn’t great, but the plus side is that I was given a good redundancy package and I already had some savings. My uncle is an independent financial adviser, so he has given me help to get the ball rolling, but my main task is to find a new job.”For more information about securing your first home, go to HSBC’s first-time buyer’s guideOther respondents want to put money away to set up their own businesses – from marketing agencies to pizza joints. According to them, the freedom and independence that comes with running their own venture is the primary draw.“I want to run my own marketing company in Spain – where I’m from – once I graduate, so I’d say that’s my financial goal. Once I’ve done my master’s, I’ll start to save up money for the business. I’ve been asking my parents for money a lot lately, so I do need to have a proper plan in place – it’s just difficult when you’re studying and don’t have much free time. I’m really looking forward to the independence working for yourself brings, and I really like the idea of being challenged creatively.”For more information about finding the right finance for your business, go to HSBC’s guide to business borrowingSome respondents had very specific goals in mind as well as specific measures to help to fund them.“My aim this year is to finish paying for my extension and landscape gardener! I’m retired, so I spend a lot of time at home and in the garden. Last year, I downsized from a larger house to a smaller one, so I have the money to pay for it, which is lucky. I don’t have a mortgage or any huge outgoings and I’m pretty good at staying on top of my finances, but obviously these things cost money. My old house had a stream running alongside it, so I’d like a water feature in my new home, too – that’s the plan, anyway.”Another challenge for millions of people across the nation is dealing with accumulated debts. Getting on an even keel financially is the obvious springboard to building a more secure future, so getting out of the red and into the black is a common goal.“I’m determined to clear my debts. I’m already putting plans in place to do that over the next few years, including the four-month project management course I’m currently enrolled on. It can be difficult working and studying at the same time, but my goal is to land a job in the project management sector, and hopefully start to earn more. That should mean I’m able to find my way out of debt by making regular payments.”For more information about repaying your debts efficiently, go to HSBC’s guide to repaying your debts.Bear in mind, the value of investments and any income they generate can go down as well as up, meaning you may not get back what you invest.Whatever your goals and no matter your level of confidence with investing, HSBC could help you make better-informed decisions and could help you plan better.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

Jo Richings, 50, a business coach, author and speaker from Bristol, says she’s keen to invest but is flummoxed by the options available, and she admits she doesn’t have the time to spend researching the alternatives.“At the moment, half of my savings are in the bank and the other half is held in premium bonds, so there’s no interest being made,” she says. “I’m quite risk-averse when it comes to stocks and shares, and don’t know much about what to invest in. I know I need to do more but I haven’t got the patience for it.”However, the current economic climate means it’s more important than ever to take a long-term view on our financial futures, whether it’s saving for – and then living through – retirement, or simply making sure loved ones are taken care of, argues James Hewitson, Head of Wealth and Advice at HSBC. But, he notes, many people think investing is not for them because they believe they are not wealthy enough.“This comes from a common misconception that you need a lot of spare cash to start investing,” he says. “Others simply don’t know where to begin and even if they look into investing themselves they encounter technical jargon – which is a major turn off.”HSBC is taking steps to help its 38 million customers worldwide manage their day-to-day finances and save for the future. The bank aims to break down those barriers stopping people from investing and instead provide a wide range of modern and accessible tools with 247 help whenever customers want and need it. These include My Investment, where customers can create and access tailored investment advice starting with £1,000, in just a few minutes, and InvestDirect, an easy-to-use system with access to a range of shares and tools to help the selection process. For those not sure if they are ready to invest, the bank has a try-before-you-buy function, allowing consumers to gain confidence by road testing the stocks and shares market as a virtual investor before deciding to go ahead.These financial planning and investment services are available to many millions of customers, from those who are starting out with a few hundred pounds to put away for a rainy day, right up to people who are ready to retire and want to know how best to invest their pension pots.“As our services are one part of a customer’s broader banking relationship, we can provide help and support on all aspects of a customer’s financial life – not just savings and investments,” says Hewitson.Plan for the futureInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

One government minister was quick to dismiss Hammond’s allegations, but they raised fears that the prime minister faces a conflict of interest.“Many hedge-fund managers see Brexit (including the no-deal variety) as an opportunity from which they obviously hope to profit, and they are positioning their portfolios accordingly,” said financial commentator and author Frances Coppola.Johnson received five-figure donations from several leading fund managers during the Conservative leadership race, some of whom also backed the Leave campaign.“Those who donated to Johnson’s campaign aren’t necessarily trying to influence policy: they may simply see him as the best hope of getting the Brexit they want. But financial backing from people who hope to profit from Brexit creates a conflict of interest for Johnson, since it puts psychological pressure on Johnson to deliver what his backers want rather than what is in the best interests of the country,” Coppola warned.The Financial Conduct Authority declined to comment on Hammond’s claim. The FCA is responsible for regulating short-selling in the UK. This is the practice by which investors bet against a stock by borrowing its shares, selling them, and hoping to buy them back at a cheaper price.The FCA maintains a database of short positions, which show that more than 130 investors have built up more than 500 bets against London-listed companies, such as outsourcing group Kier and motoring assistance group AA.For example, Odey Asset Management has taken short positions against homebuilder Berkeley Group and shopping centre landlord Intu. The property sector is seen as particularly vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit, which would hurt consumer spending and deter people from moving house.City grandee and hedge fund manger Crispin Odey, who runs the fund, has publicly backed Boris Johnson and supported Brexit.But Odey also holds short positions in Debenhams and  Bank, who are both under pressure due to non-Brexit issues.Also, so-called ‘longshort’ fund managers, such as Odey, often bet against a particular company by shorting it, and buying its rivals. This strategy can pay off regardless of macro-economic conditions, if the company in question underperforms the rest of the sector.The Financial Times has disputed the notion that a no-deal Brexit is a hedge fund conspiracy.“Equity outcomes are explicitly uncertain – what is a short position on a “no deal Brexit”? A short position on any company? A short position could also be a play on remain. For instance, a company might benefit from a stronger dollar, or less EU regulation,” FT Alphaville explained.The pound plunged after the 2016 referendum, and typically weakens whenever a no-deal Brexit looks more likely.Bets against sterling have soared since the EU referendum, hitting a two-year high in August according to data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But this may indicate that investors are trying to protect themselves from Brexit, as much as to profit from it.Hammond said in the Times that “Johnson is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit – and there is only one option that works for them: a crash-out no-deal that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring.”Business minister Nadhim Zahawi claimed this “ugly smear” was completely untrue.The claim has also been promoted by the prime minister’s sister, Rachel. She told the BBC’s World At One that “people who have invested billions in shorting the pound or shorting the country in the expectation of a no-deal Brexit” could be driving the government’s strategy.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has written to the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, asking if there may be a conflict of interest in Johnson’s acceptance of support from hedge funds that could gain from an economic shock.The financial markets have become increasingly jittery about Brexit risks in recent months, following Johnson’s claim that Britain would leave the EU on 31 October ‘do or die’.Earlier this month, the Byline Times claimed that Johnson’s backers had taken more than £8bn of “aggregate short positions” against the pound. However, its claim that hedge funds had recently ramped up their short positions was dismissed by Full Fact, the independent fact-checking charity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bbebf94f55d05de431c1f0717bafd42f994c152/147_531_4809_2885/master/4809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85fbfa0c882475a4cd7ea99c58f4c094","title":"today at the conservative party conference","story":"Johnson claims to be ‘the model of restraint’ and Matt Hancock stands corrected on the number of hospital upgradesBoris Johnson claiming “I have been the model of restraint” over last week’s rowdy session in the House of Commons, when he described Labour MPs’ warnings about their personal safety as “humbug”.Matt Hancock had a rolling Twitter spat with the shadow secretary for health, Jonathan Ashworth, about whether the government’s announcement of 40 hospital upgrades was misleading. “It’s six hospital reconfigurations not 40 new hospitals,” Ashworth corrected him.They were all niche: but Liz Truss, managed to raise a laugh in the conference hall by claiming her recent world trade tour meant that she had spent “more time in an aircraft cabin than John Bercow spends looking in the mirror”.For the party faithful, it was Jacob Rees-Mogg, who played to his audience with references to Flanders and Swann’s I’m a Gnu, and Georgie Porgie.The main speeches to come on Monday are from the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and chancellor of the exchequer, Sajid Javid.

Speaking at a fringe event at the Conservative party conference, he said he was “very worried” by falling vaccination rates, indicating the government could act soon.“I’ve said before that we should be open-minded, and frankly, what I’d say is that when the state provides services to people then it’s a two-way street – you’ve got to take your responsibilities, too,” Hancock told the Q\u0026ampA session hosted by the Huffington Post.“So I think there’s a very strong argument for having compulsory vaccinations for children when they go to school, because otherwise they’re putting other children at risk.“Then I’d want to make it very easy if the children do arrive at school not vaccinated, simply to get vaccinated, and make it the norm. But I think there’s a very strong argument for movement to compulsory vaccination, and I think the public would back us.”Several US states, including California, have introduced such laws for state school pupils but also faced lengthy legal challenges.Asked about such potential opposition in the UK, Hancock said: “Actually, I’ve received advice inside government this week on how we might go about it, and I’m looking very seriously at it.”The UK has lost its official measles-free country status from the World Health Organization after a gradual fall in rates of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) immunisation.Figures released earlier this week showed that for vaccinations administered at the ages of 12 months, 24 months and five years, there has been a marked decline for 13 different diseases, including whooping cough, diphtheria and meningitis.Hancock said this was “a serious problem” and added: “It’s unbelievable, I think, that Britain has lost its measles-free status, and it should be a real wake-up call. I think that the social media companies have got a lot to answer for, because they allow the spread of anti-vaccine messages.“I will do whatever I can – the science is absolutely clear and settled on the importance of vaccination. And the worst thing is that if you don’t vaccinate your child, and you can, then the person you’re putting at risk is not only your child but it’s also the child who can’t be vaccinated for medical reasons.”Hancock first raised the idea of compulsory vaccinations in May, saying he did not wish to do it but might be forced to act if no other solutions to improve take-up rates could be found.He said: “Those who have promoted the anti-vaccination myth are morally reprehensible, deeply irresponsible and have blood on their hands.”Confidence in the MMR vaccination seems to have dropped at least partly in response to social media misinformation and scare stories. The discredited claims of Andrew Wakefield, who in 1998 theorised that the jab was linked to autism, are widely circulated.Wakefield was struck off the medical register in 2010 after suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/154c53754003420af2c5c1b2452e75859724ec1a/0_112_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9952db966858acf7e3b7c740144ca7f","title":"truck drivers should be routinely tested for sleep apnoea","story":"Half of Italian truck drivers surveyed suffered from a breathing problem that could cause them to fall asleep at wheelTruck drivers should be routinely tested for sleep apnoea after a study found that half of them suffer from breathing disorders.In a survey of 905 Italian truck drivers, it was found that approximately half suffered from at least one sleep-related breathing problem that could potentially cause them to fall asleep at the wheel.In a presentation at the European Respiratory Society international congress today (Monday), Luca Roberti, president of Apnoici Italiani, the Italian sleep apnoea patient association, called for compulsory testing of sleep-related breathing problems by European haulage companies.“Considering that drivers are in charge of transport vehicles weighing several tons, companies have a great moral and civic responsibility to ensure their employees are safe to drive and are not at risk of suddenly falling asleep at the wheel,” he said.Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing. Research has shown that someone who is deprived of sleep due to OSA may be up to 12 times more likely to be involved in a driving accident.The European Union Directive, created to limit accidents arising from OSA, requires drivers with moderate or severe OSA to seek medical advice before their licences can be issued or renewed.The study was carried out in 2018 at the request of the Italian truck driver cooperative, Federtrasporti.On 44 days between March and December, doctors and nurses spoke to drivers at truck dealerships owned by 50 different companies.They measured height, weight and waist circumference, medical conditions, such as diabetes, and also took into account lifestyles and whether the participants smoked or took drugs. Other factors that were considered included length of service, distances travelled and whether they drove national or international routes.Of the 905 drivers interviewed, 887 were men and 17 women with an average age of 46 years.Roberti said: “This observational study has underlined the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea among truck drivers, which is greater than the prevalence in the general population. This is due to a lifestyle that forces the drivers to sit for several hours a day, with little physical activity and a poor diet, leading to a greater risk of excessive daytime sleepiness and of dozing off unexpectedly while driving.”“Haulage companies should make it compulsory for their drivers to have examinations to diagnose any sleep-related breathing problems, and both they and their drivers should give careful consideration to drivers’ diets,” concluded Roberti."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0311037c93d3ba0ac29badf32fc864edf602fbe8/0_13_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91e16dbd8d7471dc41aeda82d6e47eb5","title":"lewis hamilton wins russian grand prix formula one f1","story":"Fascinating and revealing, the Russian Grand Prix presented an appropriately Chekhovian drama, exposing both strengths and faultlines at the very top of Formula One. With Lewis Hamilton’s win there was delight and in Ferrari’s defeat disorder. Hamilton and Mercedes issued notice that, even when they are down, they are not out while Ferrari endured foment and failure in Sochi that reflects the knife-edged balancing act the team now face with their drivers.Hamilton’s victory on the shores of the Black Sea was admirable. Driver and team pulled off an unlikely win against the odds. With Ferrari quicker here, Mercedes’ decision to try an alternate strategy by starting on the medium tyres paid off. Hamilton, who had started in second, had kept in touch with the leading Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc. His harder rubber enabled him to stay out after their stops and then to pit under the virtual safety car. With less time lost in his stop he took the lead and then executed the run to victory with precision. His ninth win this year has put one hand on his sixth title and he was ecstatic.“Just an incredible day for the team considering the challenges we’ve had,” said Hamilton, who now leads the world championship by 73 points from his teammate Valtteri Bottas, who was second. “Ferrari are still quite dominant at the moment, so it’s taken quite a special job from us today to come out ahead of them.”Ferrari had indeed been on top all weekend until their challenge fell apart. Centre stage in Russia was the Scuderia’s troika of Leclerc, Vettel and the team principal, Mattia Binotto. From the off the three engaged in an over-complicated and perhaps unnecessary dance. With Leclerc on pole they were looking for a one-two and, when Vettel passed Hamilton off the start from third, all seemed well. The team had pre-arranged that he would slipstream Leclerc into turn two to prevent Hamilton from having a shot at passing. Vettel took the tow and went past Leclerc into the lead.Soon afterwards the team instructed Vettel to give back the position. Vettel refused, arguing he would have taken the place anyway and that Leclerc was not close enough. With heads shaking on the Ferrari pit wall, Leclerc insisted he had respected the plan but Vettel still refused to let him by and extended his lead. As Hamilton closed, the internecine strife became a distraction, Ferrari acceded to Vettel, telling Leclerc they would still do the swap later in the race.They managed to do so through the pit stops and for the race itself the issue was moot soon afterwards as Vettel retired with an MGU-K failure. A later further stop for Leclerc to take the soft tyres cost him second place as Mercedes secured their eighth one-two of the season. Yet as they celebrated, Ferrari surely began what will be a long debrief. Leclerc was aggrieved in Singapore when the Ferrari strategy cost him the lead and a potential win in Vettel’s favour. He took that on the chin but emphasised in Sochi that he had to be confident his teammate would play the game.“The trust doesn’t change and we need to trust each other, Seb and myself,” he said. “Because it’s usually important for the benefit of the team in some situations to know that you can count on the other car, and vice versa. It’s very important but the trust is still here.”Vettel hedged on the pre-race plans. “I don’t know exactly what happened there,” he said. “I think we had an agreement and I spoke with Charles before the race. I think it was quite clear. I don’t know. Maybe I missed something. I’m sure we’ll talk about it.”Binotto, however, was explicit that the plan had been for Leclerc to give Vettel a slipstream to control the opening lap and said: “Ideally we would have swapped back.” He was, perhaps diplomatically in public, conciliatory towards Vettel. “Seb was very fast in the race,” he said. “So I think every decision could have been postponed”.Vettel was quicker and he had made a superb start but his flat refusal to obey team orders – as he did in the infamous Multi21 incident at Malaysia in 2013 – will not have been lost on Leclerc or on Ferrari.Vettel was unquestionably their No1 driver when the season began. The 21-year-old Leclerc, however, has undoubtedly been the better driver over the season. Vettel has been usurped but the complex nature of how Ferrari planned those opening corners suggests they have neither redefined a pecking order nor simply opted to let their men race.With their car looking hugely competitive, boding well for next year, Leclerc has firmly staked his claim as their lead while Vettel has made it clear that on occasion he still views team orders as suggestions. It is not an ideal combination for harmony and while Leclerc is still in his first year at Ferrari and taking it well for now, he has shown character already that suggests he will not lie down in future. Russia has ratcheted up the pressure on Ferrari. If victory rather than drama is their goal, managing their leading actors is vital. Max Verstappen finished in fourth place having started from ninth after a five-place grid penalty. His Red Bull teammate Alexander Albon did well to claim fifth after starting in the pitlane.Carlos Sainz was sixth for McLaren in front of the Racing Point of Sergio P√©rez, Lando Norris was in eighth for McLaren, with Haas’s Kevin Magnussen in ninth and Nico H√ºlkenberg in 10th for Renault."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1d39afade41a74cd00a995fa6dd67185a4631e9/0_13_2841_1705/master/2841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34ddec2627250473172f1a44d6e64bbc","title":"mads pedersen uci world championship elite mens road race","story":"Cyclists’ legs react in unpredictable ways at the end of a bone-chilling cold and wet day on the bike. As two of the hottest favourites in the world road race championship fell to pieces in the space of 15 minutes the 23-year-old Mads Pedersen sprang through in unexpected style to give Denmark its first elite men’s title beating Italy’s Matteo Trentin, becoming the youngest male world champion in the category in 20 years.“After six and a half hours on the bike like that, everyone is on the limit and anything can happen,” said Pedersen.At the bell the title looked destined for Mathieu van der Poel or Trentin, the two men who had dominated the Tour of Britain a couple of weeks ago. The young Dutchman had sprung clear of a sodden, struggling peloton on the stiff little climb of Oak Beck with two and a half laps remaining, and Trentin – as he had done several times on British roads earlier this month – had been on him like a shot.The pair had linked up with an earlier move that included Pedersen, the Swiss track specialist Stefan Küng and the Italian Gianni Moscon. With the strength of the Belgian and French teams fading – owing partly, no doubt, to the low temperatures and constant soaking – and Peter Sagan playing a waiting game, the quintet gradually forged a lead nudging a minute.Suddenly, immediately after taking the bell at a lap to go, Van der Poel’s strength seemed to desert him and he began to flounder, going in a matter of seconds from gold medal favourite to also-ran, with disbelief on the faces of the chasing peloton as they passed him.Moscon then slipped back but Trentin, even after losing his team-mate, looked the likely winner on the strength of his two Tour de France wins this season. However, as others have found, the Parliament Street finish can be unexpectedly tough. Trentin launched his sprint at 200m to go just after passing Bettys Tea Rooms but faded like a deflating Yorkshire pudding.Pedersen’s instant reaction as Trentin kicked showed he had adapted the best to the grim conditions and he overhauled the Italian with apparent ease to win by well over a bike length, adding a first major title to a more than respectable record. Last year he was the youngest podium finisher in the Tour of Flanders when he took second to Niki Terpstra, something that now looks like a springboard to cycling’s ultimate single-day title.A former winner of the junior Paris-Roubaix with a string of victories at under-23 level, he had expected to work for Jakob Fuglsang and Michael Valgren but, when neither of his leaders made it into the winning break, he took his chance. “The plan was for me to get in a move early in the final phase and Fuglsang and Valgren would come from behind, but they couldn’t follow Van der Poel and Trentin. In the sprint I wanted to survive.”This was a sodden climax to a weather-battered nine days of racing. Rain fell throughout, for the second time in the week the fanzone was closed because of flooding, while there was little helicopter television footage because of low cloud and breaks in television transmission because of issues with the relay plane. Throughout, the riders were swaddled in rain jerseys, capes and gilets, faces grew increasingly drawn and red-eyed and towards the end riders could be seen wringing out their rain gloves and flapping their hands to keep the blood moving.There was a lengthy list of withdrawals: Primoz Roglic almost as soon as the race reached Harrogate with 125km remaining the 2013 champion, Philippe Gilbert, and his young teammate Remco Evenepoel following a heavy crash on Parliament Street the defending champion, Alejandro Valverde, as the race began building with 60km to go and Geraint Thomas shortly afterwards.There were vast puddles and glassy corners to negotiate but most significant was flooding in the high Pennines that caused the race route to be amended at the last minute to eliminate a loop over the climbs of Buttertubs and Grinton Moor. Arguably, that made the course harder, with two extra laps of the unforgiving finish circuit in Harrogate added to the initial seven to make up the distance. “A world championship for madmen,” said Valverde. Maybe, but definitely one for Mads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f43bd4c101a41633cf0b2dc92d67ba64c457dbe1/0_2299_3211_1927/master/3211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9184bd6ee02aea949ba118296c13e4c","title":"eric reid carolina panthers safety nfl colin kaepernick","story":"The usual excuses were trotted out when Colin Kaepernick’s fellow protestor found himself out of a job. And none of them turned out to be trueWhy Eric Reid wasn’t playing football at the start of 2018 was as obvious to his detractors as anyone. But with each passing week, with each snap, with each dynamic swoop to close on a quarterback or break up a pass, that eight-month stretch out of the NFL takes on a darker, more sinister tone.To recap, Reid knelt alongside his friend Colin Kaepernick in 2016 when they played together at the San Francisco 49ers. And, just like Kaepernick, he soon found himself without a job despite being a solid pro and in the prime years of his career. Detractors hit Reid with the same nonsense that they used to justify Kaepernick’s exile. A rebuke of his political beliefs dressed up as football commentary: he couldn’t find a team because he wasn’t very good players of his type, at his position, were dying out he would be a distraction.Unlike Kaepernick Reid eventually found a team willing to take him on – he signed for the Carolina Panthers four months after filing a grievance against the NFL alleging teams colluded to keep him out of the league. Reid plays at safety and teams want linebacker-safety hybrids, guys who are comfortable playing the run and turning and running in coverage. Reid is the prototype.And, in some ways, Reid has been a distraction. He speaks freely and openly about politics, and continues to kneel for the anthem. He has accused – with some justification – the NFL of singling him out for drug tests. He has got into a pre-game scuffle with another player campaigning for social justice, Malcolm Jenkins. And, besides, are Reid’s storylines any more of a distraction than the Panthers’ run on a behind-the-scenes documentary? Or star quarterback Cam Newton’s new vegan diet? Or whether this is Newton’s last year in Charlotte or not? Sunday saw Reid’s best performance of the season so far, his best since his return. He rattled Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson physically and mentally. Reid was here there and everywhere, in coverage and in the backfield. He finished the game with a tackle for a loss, a fumble recovery, and a sack.Reid was forced to play a pair of quarters on Sunday. He left the stadium in a walking boot. He hobbled from play to play, with an obvious, pronounced limp. “It would have been easy for him not to go back into the game but he gutted it out,” Rivera said post-game. “That’s the kind of young man he is.”Reid wanted to play football and to help people. For that, he was shunned, ostracized. Now, given an opportunity to play, he has thrived. And his play serves as a snap-to-snap reminder of that period in league history when teams chose cowardice over what was right and just – and good for them.At half time of the Bears-Vikings game, Chicago’s backup quarterback Chase Daniel was 1621 passing, with 138 yards and a touchdown. That’s more passing yards than Mitchell Trubisky has had in seven of his 29 career starts. The Bears have a Trubisky problem and it’s time to admit it.Chicago have the best defense in the league, by a pretty decent distance. Historically, defensive performance varies year-to-year. If you stumble upon a franchise quarterback, you have a good offense for a decade, but keeping a great defense together is hard: free agency, injuries, and age all sap a unit of its talent. That’s not the case in Chicago though – they were the top unit in the NFL last year and have somehow improved.Not cashing in on this window would be a crime. The pride of a GM – and the organization as a whole, who traded up to get Trubisky in a draft that also contained Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson – cannot cost the team a legitimate shot at a Super Bowl.Minshew Mania is here to stay. Gardner Minshew inspired the Jaguars to their come from behind victory on the road in Denver with his patented blend of machismo and swagger and odd, off-script playmaking. I mean, what even is this?The NFL’s Next Gen stats system paints an even more bonkers portrait:Minshew finished the day 1933 passing for 213 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions. Leonard Fournette and the Jaguars defense played well too (Fournette had the best game of his career), but it was Minshew’s fearlessness that eventually wore down the Broncos defense and got the Jags over the line. Minshew continues to defy his pre-draft expectations: he’s an instant star.“Not all of Mozart’s paintings were perfect” – Chiefs coach Andy Reid following the team’s 34-30 win over the Lions in Detroit.There has never been a better distillation of what it means to be a ‘football guy’. Reid doesn’t know nor care if Mozart was a painter, decorator, composer or bank robber. Tell him tonight and he’ll forget by tomorrow. Unless Mozart can do a job on special teams – unlikely – Reid’s not interested.Vontaze Burfict’s hit on a defenseless Jack Doyle was barbaric:Burfict’s play, dating back to his days in college and through his pro career in Cincinnati and Oakland ranks among the dirtiest of any sports figure anywhere at any time. He isn’t looking to tackle opponents, he’s looking to do serious harm.The NFL has enabled Burfict long enough, we are only a week removed from Burfict randomly punching players at the end of a play. His career with the Bengals was marred with grizzly hits and cowardly acts. Cincy finally had enough. Oakland decided to reward his actions with a fat free-agent deal and a team captaincy. It’s time for the league to step in and levy a long-term ban.- The Dallas Cowboys lost their unbeaten record with a 12-10 lost to the Saints in New Orleans. Teddy Bridgewater, in for the injured Drew Brees, hasn’t exactly shone at quarterback for the Saints but he has won both his games as the temporary starter. He was also, correctly, quick to thank his defense and the team’s excellent kicker, Wil Lutz, who was successful on all four of his field goals. - Your Defensive Player of the Year through a quarter of the season: Tampa Bay’s Shaquil Barrett. Barrett is the first player since sacks were officially recorded in 1982 to have at least eight sacks (!) and one interception in his team’s first four games of a season. Barrett was a former rotational rusher with the Broncos who would flash in short stints but racked up most of his production against back-ups and weaker offensive lineman. A move to Tampa, where he’s now an every-down player, has allowed him to fulfill his potential.- Jared Goff may have produced the least inspiring 500-yard performance in NFL history. The Bears clearly have a quarterback problem, and the Rams may have one too. Since 2017, when Goff entered the league, only two other quarterbacks – Jameis Winston and Kirk Cousins – have turned the ball over more. Goff has coughed up 49 turnovers over his career, and has fumbled 14 times in his last 13 games. That’s not exactly the production you want from a QB making in excess of $110m guaranteed over the next four years.- Dan Quinn’s job is in danger after another lackluster performance from the Falcons. Slow starts on offense and a leaky defense have become hallmarks of the Quinn era. Who’s excited for Jay Gruden v Quinn in the inaugural XFL Bowl? Count me in.- Larry Fitzgerald passed Tony Gonzalez as the second all-time leader in receptions in NFL history during the Cardinals’ loss to the Seahawks. The Hall of Fame awaits.- Austin Ekeler finished his month as the Chargers’ starting running back with 490 yards from scrimmage and six touchdowns. Melvin Gordon hasn’t topped those figures over a four-week  at any time during his first three seasons as a pro. Gordon’s holdout was so ineffective that it feels almost mean to mention it.- The Bears’ 1936 inspired throwback uniforms were beautiful. There should be a nationwide movement to lobby the team to make them their full-time getups. The story behind them is even more interesting. The uniform was used to address one of the darkest periods in the team’s – and league’s – history: that the NFL was a segregated, all-white league in 1936, thanks to a 12-year ban on black players that ran from 1934 through 1945. That means the black players currently on the Bears roster were the first ever permitted to wear the uniform on the field."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0b348e1daadc1acb7dd70f738ada6460c84e189/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfa2b8dd7eb1e5d507443562a5d01fe","title":"scotland v samoa rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"Here’s a little pre-match reading, courtesy of Andy Bull in Kobe:Kobe’s Misaki Stadium is looking fine tonight, but I wonder what’s being said in that there huddle.On the plus side, Scotland have only ever lost one game to Samoa.

David Bintley and Galina Samsova’s 1999 restaging purposely looked back to early sources to tell its story of innocence, betrayal and supernatural spirits.The company brings a gentle touch to the ballet’s stylings. César Morales’s Count Albrecht embodies aristo elegance, even as naive Giselle believes he’s a peasant like her. He’s an entitled, rules-don’t-apply charmer, trying to pretend he’s a man of the people. (Perhaps there are some modern political parallels after all.) Momoko Hirata, meanwhile, is a sweet, pure and guileless Giselle, her softness rubbing off on Albrecht.The supporting cast are impressive. Kit Holder manages to make his Hilarion seem like a real person, and his sympathetic presence provides an effective foil to the Count. And, as Giselle’s mother, Marion Tait gives a masterclass in making small parts matter, nailing Albrecht with a stare that could stop time.Leading the vengeful wilis, Samara Downs is an imperious queen, channelling Claire Foy in The Crown: pursed, unimpressed, weighted with responsibility. There’s no wafting around for this ghostly spirit. Her clan of wronged women follow suit, and, especially when the music is taken at businesslike pace, their implacability is pleasingly sinister.Act one has its lulls, but this is a production with some beautiful dancing: Hirata springing from the floor like a puppet on wires, hard to believe she’s propelling herself the poignantly slow pas de deux with repentant Albrecht. The mad scene pushes the right buttons, even if having Giselle stab herself does not seem as powerful as dying of a broken heart.This Giselle is not flashy, not trying to be relevant or shake things up. And it doesn’t have the emotional transcendence of the great Giselles. But it is danced with diligence, attention and sensitivity. It may not go down in history, but it brings history alive in the present. • At Theatre Royal Plymouth, 23-25 October, and Sadler’s Wells, London, 1-2 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6bad73a9f09ca48e28940020da8c471dd24be2c/0_150_3215_1930/master/3215.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab7bd69545d440593477925dee93cdb6","title":"performance artist gisele vienne western society leaves no space for ecstasy interview","story":"Feted for her macabre and freaky stage shows, Gisèle Vienne has created a time-bending piece of ‘physical philosophy’ inspired by her clubbing daysWhen Gisèle Vienne was growing up in Grenoble, France, her artist mother used to say, “paintings are cheaper than wallpaper”. So that’s exactly what they had, all over their walls. Vienne’s mum is Dorli Vienne-Pollak (a former student of Oskar Kokoschka), who made “pretty crazy, transgressive works” inspired by everything from 80s punks and strip clubs to fantasy battle scenes. It must have been quite an eyeful for a child.Today, Vienne’s Paris home is completely white. It’s a small rebellion against her upbringing, which, balanced with the influence of her “overeducated French intellectual” father, makes complete sense of the artist Vienne has become. Her works in puppetry, theatre and dance (including Jerk, Kindertotenlieder, The Ventriloquists Convention) make headlines for their macabre obsessions: sex, violence, fantasy, serial killers and freaky dolls. Bubbling under all that is a vibrant intellect. Vienne’s conversation down the phone from France bounces fizzily from early 20th-century sociology to transcendental meditation.Vienne is not seeking darkness, she says, but stimulation. “I like to go to the edges, to question what the limits are and what we can accept. There’s something very exciting in going there. I often make this comparison to extreme sports – I think there is something ecstatic in going to the limits.” That sounds like thrill-seeking, but really it’s about unpicking complex questions of human behaviour.Her work is regularly performed in Europe and the US (she collaborates with the American novelist Dennis Cooper), but little seen in the UK, so it’s with some anticipation that her piece Crowd opens London’s Dance Umbrella festival this year. Crowd brings brightness, abandon, tenderness, humour and sensuality, along with hints of darkness and violence, and is based on Vienne’s own experiences of clubbing in Berlin in the early 90s.As a teenager, she went to squat parties in often spectacular abandoned houses and buildings in east Berlin (where she was living) or to Tresor, the legendary club in the underground vault of a bombed-out department store. “They were really extraordinary places, and the people going there were very inspiring,” she says. “The whole scene was mesmerising, all this Detroit music culture that came in had a big impact on me.”She was brought back to memories of those days when researching the iconic ballet The Rite of Spring, thinking about techno culture as a modern equivalent. “It’s very much like pagan celebrations,” she says. “It’s about ecstasy and losing control.”Vienne brings up British philosopher Jules Evans’s book The Art of Losing Control, in which he talks of the necessity of ecstatic experience. “I would say liberal capitalist western societies don’t have so much space any more for ecstatic experience, which other societies in the world do, and always have,” she says. Violence, of the type that sometimes appears in Vienne’s work, “can also be part of this ecstatic experience”, she says. “Darkness and violence are not necessarily negative. It can be very invigorating, joyful and pleasurable expressing primal energies in a context that is respectful of each other and doesn’t disturb the balance of the community.” Like a boxing match, or a pumped-up dance floor.In Crowd, we watch the increasing messiness of a wild night out to a soundtrack of Jeff Mills, DJ Rolando and Global Communication. But more than just an expression of primal energies, the performance plays with the perception of time. It seems to compress and distort – something clubbers might recognise from their own nights out – thanks to cinematic choreographic effects: freeze frames, looping repeats and brilliantly realised slow motion.“If you see Crowd live, audiences have said they feel a little bit different afterwards than before they came into the theatre, a slightly altered way of being,” says Vienne. “I think there is this double feeling of being very sharp – because it has slowed down you can see detail in a sharper way than usual – and then a little bit of this stoned feeling.”In history, much ecstatic experience was linked to religion Vienne points out that art, too, was mostly bound to religion. Its position in modern secular society is often confused with entertainment, she thinks. “I think both are totally necessary,” she says. “Entertainment is crucial and art is crucial, but I just think the contract with the audience is different, you are looking for a different experience.”So what does she want to provide with her own art? “I think it’s more on the level of spiritual experience,” says Vienne. “It’s questioning, it’s self-reflecting, it’s human-reflecting. It’s an experience of philosophy in a physical way,” she says. “Yes, I would put it that way: it’s physical philosophy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840e0d30305de73f14c67fe60af587cf619f11aa/0_157_2998_1799/master/2998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77caccdd4932944d4aa4f33680a4e528","title":"great uk activity hub win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Outdoor breaks often have a vibrant base camp offering a wide range of activities, plus advice and pit stops on hand, and a chance to socialise.

But the Bonn exhibition casts the effort to get Britain to join the European communities as one supported by Germany against the resistance of “the more or less hysterical French”, as the first postwar chancellor Konrad Adenauer put it.A framed German cartoon from 1967 depicts the UK’s journey into Europe as an arduous climb, with the chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger and other European leaders pulling prime minister Harold Wilson up the steep face of Charles de Gaulle’s upturned nose.Germany’s Anglophilia is shown to be not only political. Seven themed rooms showcase a postwar infatuation with Britain’s royal family, sport, fashion, music and sense of humour – on both sides of the iron curtain.Poster campaigns and a 1970 industrial fair in London bear witness to socialist East Germany’s longing to achieve diplomatic recognition from the UK, all the while as its regime agitated against British cultural influence in public.“Do we really have to copy all the rubbish that comes from the west?”, asked East German leader Walter Ulbricht in 1965, after a Rolling Stones concert at Berlin’s Waldbühne ended in hours of rioting. But the exhibition shows that the Stones and the Beatles found fond imitators not just in Germany’s west – where groups called the Lords or the Butlers suddenly spring up everywhere – but also in the east, where the band Music-Stromers wore uniform jackets reminiscent of those on the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.In secret, many East Germans wrote anonymous dispatches to the BBC, many of them emotional and heartbreaking, which are read out on its German-language service every Friday evening from the early 1950s.In return, what did Germany get from Britain? Admiration for German manufacturing is visually represented here by John Hegarty’s mould-breaking series of “Vorsprung durch Technik” Audi ads. There are moving symbols of postwar reconciliation, such as the cross made of nails collected from the rubble of Coventry cathedral, gifted to the parish of St Nikolai in Kiel as early as 1947.Curator Christian Peters told the  that the object he was most proud of obtaining on loan for the show was a liturgical robe depicting scenes from the destruction of Coventry and Dresden, worn by the Bishop of Coventry on Ash Wednesday.The show could have added chapters on exploring Britain’s enthusiasm for all things Germanic in the 18th, 19th and 21st century, from Wordsworth and Coleridge’s interest in German Romantic poetry to the import of Christmas tree customs, and from Kraftwerk tribute bands to the sanctification of Liverpool coach Jürgen Klopp.As it stands, it finds the British view of Germany in the 20th century to be dominated by reenactments of the second world war by peaceful means, from Escape from Colditz board games to the “beach towel war” made fun of in countless newspaper headlines, cartoons and advertising campaigns.When Germany moves towards reunification after the fall of the Berlin wall, Margaret Thatcher is the most vocal sceptic in the west, the British press conjures up images of revitalised German soldiers in spiked helmets, and leaked minutes from a meeting with historians at Chequers list Germany’s supposed national characteristics as “egocentric”, “arrogant” and “aggressive”.A coldness between the two countries is sometimes just as notable, however.When president Theodor Heuss makes the first official postwar visit of a German politician to the UK in 1958, he is photographed facing a group of standoffish Oxford students with their hands in their pockets – and spends the next weeks assuring the German public that this was not so much a sign of disrespect as a pose fashionable with the British youth of today.At the exhibition’s exit, visitors are met by a plastic merchandise figurine of Queen Elizabeth II, who waves them an unenthusiastic goodbye with a polite smile and a mechanical tilt of the wrist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f5bb3542eb3266e3b692622b45b34ec0ca375a4/0_355_5943_3566/master/5943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abb264b9bf35f8ee136bebb0ea21912b","title":"thailand pm considers moving capital as bangkok congestion takes toll","story":"Leader Prayut Chan-o-cha may follow in Indonesia’s footsteps after floating idea as a way to tackle overcrowdingThailand could be the next nation in south-east Asia to relocate its capital after Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha hinted such a move could be a “possibility” under his government.Taking inspiration from neighbouring Myanmar and similar plans being formulated in Indonesia, the Thai prime minister suggested that relocating the capital could help Bangkok overcome its mounting urban challenges.Like Jakarta, Bangkok is beset by overcrowding, pollution, rising sea levels and heavy traffic congestion.During an address at the Connecting Thailand with the World Conference on 18 September, the retired army general floated two options for a potential move. “The first is to find a city that’s neither too far nor too expensive to move to,” he said, “The second is to move to outer Bangkok to reduce crowding.”The Thai prime minister suggested that moving the government to the outskirts of Bangkok could help ease traffic flows and reduce the need to commute in and out of the city centre.Comprehensive research and studies into the social and economic impacts of such a move would be required, he added, but noted that such a move could be a “possibility” under his government.The suggestion comes weeks after Indonesian president Joko Widodo announced the administrative capital would be moved from beleaguered Jakarta to East Kalimantan, or Indonesian Borneo.It is not the first time the idea of moving Thailand’s administrative capital has been raised, with former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra also suggesting the administrative capital be moved to Nakhon Nayok, a province 100km from the capital.Studies have also been conducted on shifting government offices to Chachoengsao, an agricultural hub to the east of Bangkok.As with Jakarta, the idea of moving the capital has drawn mixed reviews, and doubts about whether such a plan would materialise.Thosaporn Sirisamphand, from Thailand’s National Economic and Social Development Council, told the Bangkok Post the prime minister was yet to ask the agency to seriously study the possibility, and that his recent suggestion may have been an on-the-cuff remark.“Capital relocation is a big issue and needs serious cooperation from various agencies,” he said. “I think General Prayut just threw an idea out to the public on how to tackle traffic congestion in Bangkok.”According to a 2018 study on the world’s worst traffic, Bangkok was ranked eighth, one place behind Jakarta, for its road congestion levels, with Mumbai first.Experts have suggested the government should first conduct studies on ways to reduce traffic congestion in Bangkok, and focus on development in second-tier provinces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a97dbc5e46289b81a172b6060d4825ecb65ed5f/0_406_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a382169978739611470849e34e8da1e6","title":"they dont understand hong kong clash of ideologies looms on chinas 70th anniversary","story":"Chinese officials blame unrest on issues such as housing or unemployment, but the problems go much deeper than thatWhen Chinese president Xi Jinping warned his Communist party cadres against the threats of “black swans” and “grey rhinoceroses” in January, there was little sign of what would lie ahead.The millions-strong protests in Hong Kong in recent months, sparked by a controversial extradition law, have morphed into an unprecedented political storm that has blown up in the faces of Hong Kong and Chinese leaders.A huge protest, planned for 1 October, is set to overshadow the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People’s Republic of China. This is the last thing Xi would want the world to see.Analysts say years of complacency by Chinese and Hong Kong governments have played a role. After the Umbrella movement in 2014 failed to pressure Beijing into granting genuine universal suffrage in Hong Kong, apathy pervaded as the pro-democracy movement dwindled. Two years ago, when the Hong Kong government ejected six pro-democracy lawmakers, it managed to pass many unpopular bills. It expected the extradition bill would also be rammed through in June in the same manner.However, officials have underestimated the deep resentment that has grown over the past 22 years, since the handover of sovereignty from Britain to China. Many rights have been eroded and the Hong Kong government, which spends heavily on infrastructure and cultural projects to integrate more closely with China, is seen as working for Beijing while undermining Hongkongers’ interests.“To the Communist party, the events in Hong Kong signal its failure,” says Jean-Philippe Béja, research emeritus professor at the centre for international studies and research at Sciences-Po in Paris. “A generation raised under the red flag not only has not become ‘patriotic’ as it hoped, but has become increasingly estranged from China.”Hongkongers’ frustrations have exploded into three months of street protests that show no sign of abating. Demonstrations have seen riot police firing teargas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and bean bag rounds at protesters who in turn have thrown petrol bombs, vandalised metro stations and set street fires. Some trampled and burned the national flag.Protesters call the movement a revolution to “reclaim” and “liberate” Hong Kong.“The level of anti-China feelings so candidly expressed is new in Hong Kong. In the past it has been cautious now the young are much more vocal,” says Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. “This is seen by China as a direct challenge.”Analysts say a catastrophic confrontation is inevitable, because the crisis is essentially the manifestation of a clash of political ideologies.China has a completely opposite set of values to those Hongkongers are clamouring for such as democracy, rule of law and basic civil rights. But Xi, who aspires to Mao’s hardline leadership, has been reinforcing the party dictatorship since he came to power in 2012 and does not want to be seen as retreating in front of a mass movement, says Béja. “He has to show the Chinese people that the so-called democratic values result in chaos.”Reflecting their Marxist-Leninist perspective, Chinese officials see material issues as the only solution. Chinese officials and state media have repeatedly said unaffordable housing and employment issues are the “root cause” of the social unrest. They believe the solution is to ease land supply, cool property prices, and above all, step up economic integration as well as ideological education – the very elements that have aroused resentment towards China.They would rather not touch the “superstructure” of ideology, political institutions and the state authority, says Wu Qiang, a former politics lecturer at Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University. “They’re not willing to use political solutions or democratic dialogue to resolve problems. It is definitely a clash of political values, and there is no solution … They don’t understand Hong Kong.”The Hong Kong crisis has posed a challenge to Xi’s authority, especially against the backdrop of the US-China trade dispute. But his position in the party seems unshaken, analysts say.“Inevitably, there are factions in the party that are against him, but unless powerful factions merge to take actions, his position remains unchallenged,” says Ngan Shun Kau, a former editor at pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po.Official Chinese rhetoric casts the Hong Kong protests as incited by “foreign hostile forces” such as the US and the UK to undermine China.“Xi is trying to put the blame on the foreign hostile forces, but his rivals inside the apparatus note that his hard line is not solving the crisis. They might use this failure against him when the opportunity arises,” says Beja.While the Hong Kong government appears to be adopting a “wait it out” strategy in the hope of a change in public opinion as the protests get increasingly radical and violent, Beijing is quietly bolstering its power in the semi-autonomous city.In an unprecedented move, China’s public security minister, or head of police, Zhao Kezhi has recently become a deputy head at the Communist party’s Hong Kong Macau liaison committee, the highest-ranking decision-making body on Hong Kong affairs, according to a report in the pro-Beijing Sing Tao newspaper this month.“No one had ever heard of the public security system getting involved in Hong Kong affairs before. This is highly significant,” says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In late August, on a visit to the border province of Guangdong, Zhao urged police to crack down on “violent and terrorist activities” and to defend political security ahead of the 70th anniversary. Back in January, while Xi warned about unpredictable risks, Zhao said China’s security forces must prevent and resist “colour revolutions” that foment regime change.Béja says Zhao’s appointment, which has not been officially announced, means the party regards the Hong Kong crisis as a national security issue and is determined to prevent contagion spreading to the mainland.While the movement has highlighted the huge conflicts between China and Hong Kong, with the protests turning more violent and radical, Beijing will only step up its control on Hong Kong, Cabestan says.“The issues at hand are largely unsolvable. The movement has morphed into a democracy movement and Beijing will never give that,” he said. “Beijing will continue to narrow Hong Kong’s political autonomy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974a8f0bc102cec21a135d9a1319c9fee929339c/11_20_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e6c875694a249e19f8b84d184fe03c","title":"ebola response in the democratic republic of congo in pictures","story":"This is the 10th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

File photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireHopes of a Brexit deal at next month’s European Council received a blow on Sunday night when DUP leader Arlene Foster ruled out any concessions on customs and the regulation of goods.Ms Foster said she could not accept any kind of internal customs border within the UK, adding Northern Ireland could not be part of two customs territories.Her comments came as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told The  that members of the Stormont assembly should play a part in the application of EU rules in the North after Brexit but time is running out to define what that role should be.Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Ms Foster said her party would be open to discussing a time-limited backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland, but she noted Mr Varadkar had already rejected it.Downing Street has also made clear that UK prime minister Boris Johnson is not interested in a time limit but wanted to scrap the backstop altogether.Britain is expected to make formal proposals later this week for an alternative to the backstop in an attempt to agree a revised withdrawal agreement ahead of the EU summit on October 17th. The European Union and Irish Government have said any alternatives must achieve the same objectives as the backstop.Britain has already agreed to regulatory alignment on the island of Ireland for animal health and some agri-food products, and is expected to offer to extend that proposal to cover industrial goods. The two sides are deadlocked on customs, with the EU insisting that without customs declarations and checks, it has no way of knowing what is coming into the North from Great Britain.‘Anathema’Ms Foster ruled out any ergence between the North and Britain on anything more than agri-foods and said any internal customs border within the UK would be “an anathema”.“It has constitutional implications as well as economic implications,” she said.Mr Johnson has been pushing for a greater role for the Northern Ireland institutions in any post-Brexit provisions for the North.In recent meetings with Mr Varadkar, such as at the United Nations in New York last week, he raised what Downing Street described as proposals on the “issue of consent” for Northern unionists.Mr Varadkar told The  that defining what sort of role Stormont could play will be difficult when the time to achieve a revised Brexit deal is short.“The Irish Government has always been open to a role for Stormont in any solution on Brexit,” he said. “If some EU rules continue to apply in Northern Ireland, it’s right that the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland should have a role.Greater say“Defining that, however, will not be easy when time is so short and when there is no Northern Ireland Executive or Assembly in place to speak for the North as a whole.”Sources in Dublin have raised concerns about some of the difficulties of involving Stormont but believe allowing the Northern Ireland institutions a greater say than is already envisaged is worth exploring.Some of the difficulties seen by Dublin include the question of what would happen in a situation where the Northern institutions are not operating giving either the unionist or nationalist community a veto, which is seen as unworkable and if any say would amount to Stormont giving its consent to Northern Ireland either entering or leaving the backstop.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Alan BetsonMichael Collins lists off figures that capture his lengthy career in the diplomatic service: 26 years abroad, 19 at home, almost 46 years in total, seven foreign postings, 11 house moves.“And three children and one wife,” he adds, with a laugh.His retirement in July on his return from Germany where he was ambassador for six years marked the end of 45-plus years as a diplomat. It was a long journey accompanied by his wife, Marie, who was a de facto deputy ambassador during most of his overseas postings given the 24-7 demands on a foreign envoy.Collins is retiring at 66, a year later than usual for a diplomat. He has set a new record.“I’m actually the longest-serving diplomat in the history of the Irish foreign service, considering that I joined at 20,” he says. “I’m very proud of that.”The Dubliner was the longest-serving ambassador in the modern era to Germany and the United States, a posting that lasted from 2007 to 2013 and covered the presidencies of George W Bush and Barack Obama.There were stints, too, as ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1995 to 1999 and to the Czech Republic from 1999 to 2001 and earlier, lower-ranking posts in Rome, New York and Washington DC.Collins gives short shrift to the old joke that a diplomat would do anything for their country but live in it.“That’s not true,” he says, insisting the balance only skewed to service abroad in later years. “To be a diplomat and to serve your country properly, you have to have a balance there. Otherwise you lose touch and then you lose effect.”He jokes that the six years (2001-2007) he served as second secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach, which was responsible for the Northern Irish peace process, “count as double”.During that time he helped oversee significant diplomatic wins: the decommissioning of IRA arms under international supervision, a new international monitoring mechanism to supervise the cessation of IRA paramilitary activities, reform of policing in Northern Ireland and restored powersharing in Belfast.“If I did nothing else in my life but be part of the resolution of those issues, I would be happy.”Career highlightsMany other career highlights leap off Collins’s CV. As a senior official and later as ambassador accompanying taoisigh, he was present in the Oval Office on 12 consecutive St Patrick’s Days from 2001 to 2013. He was lead official in the Department of the Taoiseach when Bertie Ahern delivered his historic address to the House of Commons in 2007 and was ambassador in Washington when Ahern addressed a joint meeting of the US Congress in 2008.“I have nothing to complain about,” says Collins, reflecting on his career as he settles back to life in south Dublin and the trauma of unpacking boxes after a dozen years overseas.One of his greatest career assets, Collins says, is his name, which has been “a bonus”. During his time in the US, Collins recalls inviting the Portuguese ambassador named De Vallera (with two Ls) – a neighbour – over to “the residence” for a glass of Michael Collins whiskey, a drink he liked to impress his guests with.Ireland’s then consul in Atlanta, Paul Gleeson, joked in 2013 on a visit by the ambassador that De Valera visited the American south in 1919 and it had taken 90-plus years but Michael Collins had finally made it too.“My name has resonated in a way that I can only say ‘thank you’ to my parents,” says Collins.It was not always that way. In the 1980s, in the aftermath of the IRA hunger strikes, when the diplomat was a press spokesman at the consulate in New York, republican sections of Irish America would use his name to “drag up all sorts of presumptions, that the government were too close to the Brits”.Collins says the “whole public diplomacy end” of Department of Foreign Affairs work has been the biggest change in his long career. It was previously “a very monastic place, almost very cerebral, very hushed”.“A diplomat today has to do front of house,” he says. “When I started in 1975, that did not exist. The embassies really had very little face to the world. Today, unless you are doing that, you are not doing your job.”Diversified IrelandHe is, unsurprisingly, an outspoken champion of the Government’s plan to double the diplomatic footprint around the globe by 2025. The presence need not be “extravagant”, he says, but “reasonable and effective.”“It is a consequence of a much more complex world and a much more ersified Ireland in terms of our economic interests in particular,” he says. “Unless we are out there, somebody else will eat our breakfast.”Collins dismisses the “vanity project” criticism of Ireland’s bid to win a seat on the United Nations Security Council, instead seeing it as a responsibility of a “sovereign country to be out there and playing our part”.“The last time we were on the security council was 20 years ago, so it’s not as if we’ve been vainly looking for a seat every five years. Our turn is in or around now,” he says. “It’s not a case of vanity, it’s a case of obligation. We need to step forward.”Collins says the Government was correct in pushing to have the post-Brexit arrangements for the Irish Border set as one of the three areas of negotiation between the EU and UK on the withdrawal agreement and is correct now in insisting that the backstop guarantee remain in the agreement. Where many at home see these as victories for Irish diplomacy, others abroad see red lines and intractable problems.“We stepped forward to protect our interests. We found the member states of the European Union receptive and willing. It wasn’t just a case of Ireland having a view it was a case of persuading and connecting with member states and the commission that this was a genuine issue that needed to be protected,” he says.Border ‘ignored’He notes that the issue of the Border was “blissfully ignored” during the UK’s Brexit referendum campaign. He points out how people forget that the Belfast Agreement also involved a referendum in the Republic and the Irish people giving up constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as a price for peace.“So there’s nothing frivolous about it this is serious, serious, serious stuff,” he says.From his vantage point while ambassador in Germany, Collins says that any British hopes of succeeding with special pleadings in Germany or breaking EU member states’ solidarity regarding the Brexit deal that has broken the House of Commons are “misplaced”.“From day one the Germans were very clear about the need to protect the single market and that there would be solidarity with Ireland. Of all the countries in the world they got the idea of the Border, day one, given their own history,” he says.Collins sees the EU’s cohesiveness on Brexit as a demonstration of how “a smaller country’s interests can be protected by being part of a larger entity” and points to the 90 per cent-plus support for the EU at home.As for a resolution to the current imbroglio, diplomats “talk in terms of win-win”, says Collins, but even Ireland’s longest-serving diplomat is bamboozled by how to find a fix.“The nature of our business is that everybody needs to be able to claim at least a modicum of success and victory so how that’s going to be achieved in the current issue, I simply do not know,” he says.After 46 years, including several around tense negotiating tables, Collins’s deserved retirement excuses him from duty on this one.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It wasn’t perfect.’ Photograph: Andrew Caballero-ReynoldsAFPGetty ImagesIt’s a beautiful day for an impeachment. Or at least an inquiry about an impeachment inquiry. So on Friday, as summer stretched on, I went to the Capitol to see what the speaker of the House was thinking, now that she has lowered the boom.At the tender age of 73, Donald Trump may finally have to face some consequences for his depredations. His casino games have caught up with him and this time Daddy’s not here to bail him out. How delicious that a woman has the whip hand. “Isn’t it something, Maureen?” Nancy Pelosi asks about what she calls her “wild week”. I nod. It surely is.“The president says you’re no longer speaker of the House, that you’ve been taken over by the radical left,” I say to Pelosi, who looks smart in a pink pantsuit and sparkly pink high heels. She laughs.“See, I always think he’s projecting. When he says, ‘She’s not the speaker of the House,’ what he really means is, ‘I shouldn’t be president of the United States. ’ When he says that Adam Schiff should resign, what he really means is, ‘I, Donald Trump, should resign.’ He knows that this is really very incriminating.”The speaker is in a fine mood, now that she’s turned her focus from reining in the progressives to reining in the president. Does she no longer think, as she said for months, that impeachment is so isive that it needs to be a bipartisan effort?“No, I said I hoped it would be bipartisan. I still hope so. It’s up to the Republicans whether they honour their oath of office or honour their oath of Trump.”I ask her how she feels about those who say she came to this moment belatedly. “I don’t come to anything belatedly,” she shoots back. “I have said from the start, we’ll go where the facts take us and we will be ready. And we are ready. And they’re shocked.”Epic tantrumTrump was clearly smarting that Pelosi is now on the side of an impeachment inquiry. Is the high-chair king about to have his most epic tantrum yet? Even Trump’s pal Chris Ruddy told NPR that the president may not understand the implications of the inquiry or that he’s going up against “the smartest person in Washington right now”, as Ruddy called Pelosi.The speaker would have preferred to send Trump packing at the ballot box. But since he keeps contaminating the ballot box, asking foreign countries to meddle in our elections to help him win, what choice did she have? The man who always claims the system is rigged against him keeps trying to rig the system – proving Pelosi’s point that Trump projects.About the White House officials who engaged in what she calls “the cover-up of the cover-up”, she notes: “You’d think that there would be some sense of decency on the part of the people who work for the president.”I ask her when the last time she talked to Trump was. “You mean the latest?” she says, laughing. “It may be the last.” They were talking about gun violence on the phone on Tuesday morning when the president suddenly changed the topic to the whistleblower complaint. “My conversation with the president was one in which he said the phone call was perfect and he couldn’t wait until I saw it because it was perfect. It wasn’t perfect.”The White House says it plans to work with Democrats in Congress even less than usual. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Trump met with NRA ghoul Wayne LaPierre to talk about how the NRA can chip in some blood money for the president’s defence if he stops “the games” – “the games” being any attempt to curb our periodic human sacrifices. Hasn’t Trump learned his lesson about scummy quid pro quos? It’s hard to fathom why he would slip the noose on Robert Mueller’s testimony on Russia, and then turn around the very next day and ask Ukraine to interfere in an American election.“I’ve said before, I do not have the medical background to analyse the president’s behaviour,” Pelosi says.Last tabooMaybe it’s time to break the last taboo and put a psychiatrist on staff at the White House to analyse a president’s mental state, or possible impairment?“No, I think the White House should have an honest lawyer on staff,” she says, “and not a rogue justice department.”Speaking of rogue justice and psychiatric emergencies, what does she make of America’s mayor becoming America’s nightmare?“I’m focused on the president,” she says, adding disgustedly about Rudy Giuliani: “I mean, that’s almost like a joke.”She did not arrive at her decision lightly. In between speaking at two funerals – that of Cokie Roberts, the journalist, and Emily Clyburn, the wife of the House majority whip Jim Clyburn – she talked to her members, lawyers and constitutional experts. “I had one phone call it lasted all weekend,” she says dryly. She drafted her historic statement Monday night on the plane from New York to DC.“‘Betrayal’ was a word that my members wanted me to use,” she says. “I didn’t have that in my original statement. Betrayal of the constitution. Betrayal of our national security. Betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”If only she could click those sparkly slippers three times and send Donald Trump home.\u0026nbsp– New York TimesRead more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Prince Harry to pay tribute to British soldier killed in Malawi by elephant while on anti-poaching patrolRoyal Tour 2019: A guide to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s South Africa itineraryComment: Bunging the EU billions of pounds for free shows the toxic ineptitude at the heart of May\u0026#39s Brexit dealSaudi prince warns regional war with Iran could lead to \u0026#39total collapse of global economy\u0026#39 Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesStrictly Come Dancing 2019, week 2 results show as it happened: James Cracknell eliminated after dance-off defeat to David James Donald Trump says he wants and deserves to meet whistleblowerComment: Why should people have to put up with ugly buildings in their community?Chopper\u0026#39s Brexit Podcast: Charles Moore on Margaret Thatcher’s relationship with Europe and her successor, John MajorComment: We may not like the thought, but we have a national and moral obligation to bring the Isil children back to BritainTwo women are dying needlessly every day because of a \u0026#39heart attack gender gap\u0026#39 where they do not receive equal treatment to men,  report warnsHurricane Lorenzo: Flood warnings as England and Wales brace for heavy rainRemain alliance hatch plot to force Boris Johnson into Brexit extension as early as this weekSajid Javid to announce plan for \u0026#39superbus network\u0026#39 to help revive Britain\u0026#39s cut-off rural communitiesPrisoners are throwing boiling water at staff during regular outbreaks of serious violence, damning report findsGraves of British WWII heroes finally restored after being left to crumble in the Iraqi desert for decadesGirlguides urge parents to cut down on clingfilm as they launch war on plastic wasteHundreds of children in care are being \u0026#39marched back\u0026#39 to visit their abusive parents, study findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/29/TELEMMGLPICT000211359261_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqW5LAbqXSQw_G1yEaLnMlB8rdXcrpF0u5HHyYvelOrak.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"may not like thought have national moral obligation bring isil","story":"Tooba Gondal, pictured at the Ain Issa detention camp in Syria, has asked in an open letter to the British government to be allowed to return to the United Kingdom with her childrenTooba Gondal is a British citizen and, if she is to be believed, a formerly ardent supporter of the Islamic State death cult, who is currently in detention in Kurdish-controlled Syria.

Opposition leaders are meeting today to find a way of forcing Boris Johnson to request a Brexit extension. The Remain coalition will meet in Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s office this afternoon to discuss changing the law to bring forward the date when the Prime Minister legally has to ask Brussels to extend Article 50. Political Editor Gordon Rayner explains - if successful - how soon the challenge could happen. The Prime Minister\u0027s opponents are seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Here is a reminder of how that could affect the UK. And, as the Conservative Party conference opened in Manchester, Labour activists shared an image of dead Tories hanging from a bridge.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson could face an investigation by one of his own Cabinet ministers into claims he squeezed a journalist\u0027s thigh. Despite furious denials from No 10, women and equalities minister Liz Truss said she would look at an allegation by Charlotte Edwardes that Mr Johnson touched her upper leg during a lunch. Whitehall Editor Owen Bennett has full details of the claims.Caring about conservation should not be dismissed as hippy, the Duke of Sussex has said. In impassioned words ahead of his visit to highlight conservation projects in Malawi, he issued a rallying cry for humankind to overcome greed, apathy and selfishness to guarantee its survival on the planet. The Duke has today written exclusively in The  about restoring a natural order between humans and wildlife. Read his piece here.It is the book that took 22 years to write. Ex- editor Charles Moore started working on the third and final instalment of his authorised biography of Margaret Thatcher while he was still in the post. Now he has given Chopper\u0027s Brexit Podcast an exclusive insight into his discoveries - and reveals how he was chosen to write the work by Mrs Thatcher herself. In a final extract from the book, read about how Mrs Thatcher took the lead in tackling climate change.UK flooding | Travel warnings as England and Wales brace for deluge\u0027At war every day\u0027 | Defence chief reveals extent of Russian cyber attacksMandatory vaccinations | Jabs could be made compulsory for all childrenSAS hero | Chris Ryan claims he was \u0027pressured\u0027 to hide PTSD from doctorsJohn Le Carre novels | Former MI6 spymaster no fan of \u0027corrosive\u0027 booksRiders on the storm | Cyclists plough through the flooded route on Cray Summit in the Yorkshire Dales during the UCI Road World Championships. Click through our gallery of more striking images from around the world.Nick Timothy | Politics is following the path of vicious US culture warsMichael Deacon | Boris Johnson has a simple message for his Brexit criticsJanet Daley | Arrogant political class holds British people in open contemptRoger Bootle | Robots and AI will help 32-hour week become realityJane Shilling | Behind every great woman is a man willing to be like a wifeMedical marijuana | How desperate patients are being forced to break the law      \u0027Lineker syndrome\u0027 | Understanding the taboo of men who do not want sexMind healing | Three ways to banish the blues as the nights start to draw in\u0027Helicopter money\u0027 | A radical world where central banks fund government spending is inevitable as policymakers run out of ammunition ahead of the next recession, top economists have warned. Tom Rees explains the more unconventional policies that will be explored in the next downturn.Forever 21 | American fashion chain files for bankruptcy protectionInvestment tip | We said just hold this firm last year - now it\u0027s time to buyStay on top of the markets | Live stocks and shares updates 24 hours a daySilver Queen | Dina Asher-Smith has won Great Britain\u0027s first female sprint medal at a World Championships for 36 years. Oliver Brown reports from Doha and read a special report on the making of Asher-Smith.Thanks, Seb | Vettel ignores orders to hand Lewis Hamilton victoryLeicester City 5 Newcastle United 0 | More pressure piled on Steve BruceRugby World Cup | Scotland face up to a sobering thought in Kobe\u0027This isn\u0027t work\u0027 | At the age of 84, Mary Berry could be forgiven for drifting into a well-earned retirement.

the dark about what they\u0027re buyingEnergy suppliers that do not generate or directly source green energy risk misleading customers by claiming they are “100 per cent renewable”, according to a report.Suppliers can be seen as “greenwashing” by purchasing certificates from companies that generate renewable electricity, which allow them to claim they provide zero-carbon energy, even though much of the power they actually supply may comes from fossil fuels, Which? has argued.Green Star Energy, Ovo Energy, Pure Planet, Robin Hood Energy, So Energy, Tonik Energy and Yorkshire Energy all sell “100 per cent renewable” electricity tariffs but do not generate any renewable energy themselves or buy any directly.Instead they buy Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates, whose purpose is to prove to the final customer that a given share of energy was produced from renewable sources.The average household uses a little over 3MWh of electricity per year, meaning suppliers can buy the certificates to match this usage for only around £1.55 per customer and claim a tariff is “100 per cent renewable”.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all

doing little to support additional renewable energy supply.However, some suppliers hit back at the criticism. Steven Day, co-founder of Pure Planet, said that any suggestion it misled customers is untrue and that Which?’s report demonstrates a “fundamental misunderstanding of the way electricity is generated, certified, traded, managed by the grid and supplied”.He added: “All green suppliers have to use REGOs to verify that the electricity used by their customers is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources.”Which? analysed more than 300 energy tariffs and found that 40 suppliers sold what they described as 100 per cent renewable options.It said much greater clarity is needed around how “renewable” energy is defined and marketed to ensure customers aren’t misled.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others go a step further and generate renewable electricity themselves or buy it from those that do, rather than relying on REGO certificates.Both Ecotricity and Good Energy source enough renewable electricity to match their customers’ usage, but this tends to mean their costs are higher and therefore their tariffs are more expensive.Recognising that these firms directly support renewable energy, regulator Ofgem exempted both companies from its price cap on standard variable tariffs.Richard Headland at Which? said: “As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it’s concerning that some suppliers appear to be ‘greenwashing’ their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.“We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed. People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.”Green Star Energy and Foxglove Energy both said they source all electricity from renewable generators, but Which? said the firms do not own renewable generation or have contracts with renewable generators and buy REGO certificates to match customers\u0027 use.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

report.Suppliers can be seen as “greenwashing” by purchasing certificates from companies that generate renewable electricity, which allow them to claim they provide zero-carbon energy, even though much of the power they actually supply may comes from fossil fuels, Which? has argued.Green Star Energy, Ovo Energy, Pure Planet, Robin Hood Energy, So Energy, Tonik Energy and Yorkshire Energy all sell “100 per cent renewable” electricity tariffs but do not generate any renewable energy themselves or buy any directly.Instead they buy Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates, whose purpose is to prove to the final customer that a given share of energy was produced from renewable sources.The average household uses a little over 3MWh of electricity per year, meaning suppliers can buy the certificates to match this usage for only around £1.55 per customer and claim a tariff is “100 per cent renewable”.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all

doing little to support additional renewable energy supply.However, some suppliers hit back at the criticism. Steven Day, co-founder of Pure Planet, said that any suggestion it misled customers is untrue and that Which?’s report demonstrates a “fundamental misunderstanding of the way electricity is generated, certified, traded, managed by the grid and supplied”.He added: “All green suppliers have to use REGOs to verify that the electricity used by their customers is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources.”Which? analysed more than 300 energy tariffs and found that 40 suppliers sold what they described as 100 per cent renewable options.It said much greater clarity is needed around how “renewable” energy is defined and marketed to ensure customers aren’t misled.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others go a step further and generate renewable electricity themselves or buy it from those that do, rather than relying on REGO certificates.Both Ecotricity and Good Energy source enough renewable electricity to match their customers’ usage, but this tends to mean their costs are higher and therefore their tariffs are more expensive.Recognising that these firms directly support renewable energy, regulator Ofgem exempted both companies from its price cap on standard variable tariffs.Richard Headland at Which? said: “As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it’s concerning that some suppliers appear to be ‘greenwashing’ their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.“We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed. People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.”Green Star Energy and Foxglove Energy both said they source all electricity from renewable generators, but Which? said the firms do not own renewable generation or have contracts with renewable generators and buy REGO certificates to match customers\u0027 use.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Home Office did not deny these allegations.The High Court has now granted permission for the practice to be challenged in court, with the evidence uncovered by this newspaper forming part of the basis for the challenge.The judge expressed concern about the alleged policy of collaboration with the Zimbabwean authorities and the fact that the Home Office had failed to provide any details about the practice.If successful, the judgement could force the UK government to reconsider the claims of hundreds of failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers who may have been subject to this policy.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A sheep on London Bridge as Freemen of the City of London took up their historic entitlement to drive sheep over the bridge, which was once London\u0027s only river crossingAn Aldabra giant tortoise is fed watermelon as a treat at the Malvern Autumn Show, at the Three Counties Showground near Malvern in WorcestershireGallery assistants pose with an artwork entitled \u0027Devolved Parliament\u0027 by British artist Banksy, during a press view in London ahead of Sotheby\u0027s contemporary art sale, as part of the Frieze Art FairEngland\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

She refused to be questioned without her solicitor and was permitted to leave. In August, she was granted refugee status.Recalling the meeting, the woman, who did not want to be named,\u0026nbsptold The Independent: “The man had my file on the table. He started speaking to me in my native language. He said the British government and the Zimbabwean government had agreed to send some of the Zimbabwean people back to their country.“I was frightened, and very angry. Why was the British government allowing this person to be in their office? We are hiding here and they bring someone who I’m running away from.

He wanted to know about my parents and relatives in Zimbabwe,” the man said.“I refused to give him information about myself. I was afraid – if they confirmed it was me, what would they do with that information? He wasn’t even concerned about whether I was an asylum seeker.”The claimant bringing the court case, a woman known only as AG, was refused asylum on the grounds that\u0026nbspwhile the Home Office accepted she was an anti-government protester, she was not of sufficient profile to attract adverse attention from government officials if returned to the country.UK orders deportation of people fleeing persecution under ‘deal’She and her legal representatives argued that the alleged Home Office policy of sharing information about failed asylum seekers with the Zimbabwean authorities “fundamentally undermined” this, as it would alert authorities to their cases.Her barrister, Rowan Pennington-Benton, said that if successful\u0026nbspthe case could force the Home Office to reassess the cases of at least 2,500 failed asylum seekers, and called on the department to provide clarity on the policy.“We need a proper explanation and therefore appreciation of the nature and scope of the agreement actually reached between the UK and the Zimbabwean governments,” he said.“Certainly, there are a lot of failed asylum seekers from Zimbabwe whose cases were effectively believed in terms of being anti-government work that they were doing, but who have been told they can be returned\u0026nbspbecause they will slip under the radar.“Yet this is a policy that appears to put them above the radar, or slap bang in the middle of the radar.”UK orders deportation of people fleeing persecution under ‘deal’Home Office accused of ‘staggering’ disregard for innocent peopleCalls for review into Home Office outsourcing to ‘exploitative’ firmPaul Blomfield, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, who raised concerns about the policy earlier this year, said the policy contravened the principle of fair treatment of those seeking refuge\u0026nbspand put iniduals at risk of persecution.“I have received many disturbing reports from constituents over the way that the Home Office is coordinating with the Zimbabwean government, by allowing their officials to interview asylum applicants in the UK,” he continued.“All removals to Zimbabwe should be to be postponed while this political situation continues, and there are real concerns about the safety of returnees. The current Zimbabwean government should not be given this access to vulnerable asylum seekers.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Re-documentation interviews are a standard part of Home Office process where an interview is required by the receiving country to confirm identity and in order for a travel document to be produced.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The video did not appear to show much danger in the building.Another video, apparently taken from inside of an airport, likewise showed overhead lights swaying as would-be passengers looked on. Yet another video simply showed a chandelier swaying.The quake comes nine years after a much stronger, 8.8 magnitude quake decimated parts of the Chilean coast.That earthquake, in 2010, hit in a similar location to the Sunday quake, and caused widespread damage after a tsunami was triggered.The Sunday earthquake was originally reported by the USGS to be a 7.2 quake, but was later downgraded to a 6.8.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They scream “You should be in jail”, then faint with shock at his far more moderate language.Labour call Tories “dirty”, “callous” or even “murderers”. Their IRA-backing shadow chancellor sniggers about lynching a female Tory.The Left cheers as a rapper waves the severed head of a Boris effigy on stage. Then they clutch their pearls when the PM pushes back.The Lib Dems scream “B***ocks to Brexit”— then demand everyone ELSE tones down their language.Speaker Bercow is right. The Commons is “toxic”. But he is blind to his blatant Remain bias helping to create it.Voters can see what this is: An organised assault to topple Boris and Brexit.Many MPs are feigning offence for effect — and for their Twitter fans. A few are genuinely upset, but only because they have mistaken their bid to reverse or ­neuter Brexit for a noble cause.It is not. Not after you have voted for a binding referendum, promised repeatedly to enact it and put the result in law.Boris calls it a “betrayal” because it is.He calls the rogue Act forcing him to beg another delay from the EU on their terms a “surrender” because it is.No, Yvette Cooper, his words are not “designed to escalate ision and hatred”. They accurately describe hugely powerful emotions, justiably felt by millions of Leavers and brought on by those politicians blocking Brexit.In  these Remainers could have accepted defeat, as others did. Instead they sided with a minority who refused, who chose to denigrate Leavers as thick racists, who willed them on to die, who promoted baseless conspiracies to delegitimise the vote.And who would now pour petrol on this fire they have started by forcing on our riven nation a second referendum openly rigged for Remain.That’s why Leavers feel betrayed.That’s what lies behind their rage.What excuse do Remainers have for theirs  That they lost  That one man still stands inconveniently between them and their destruction of a historic democratic mandate  That’s shameful.We deplore all the hatred and any targeting of MPs. We feel for their families.But how about some self-awareness and contrition from Remainer MPs, especially the malicious extremists of the hard-Left, about their own starring role in causing it IT is terrying to see vaccination rates for dangerous childhood diseases dropping.Some of it is parental idleness. Some is the spread of long-debunked internet scare stories.All families MUST be made to get kids their jabs before rates fall so low these illnesses can take hold.If that needs fines or exclusions, so be it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t to be.I first noticed Demi in , when she appeared in the movie Ghost, as fresh-faced, husky-voiced Molly, mourning the death of her husband Sam, played by Patrick Swayze.She looked adorable, with elfin cropped hair, little make-up and denim dungarees.Everyone wanted to look like this particularly gorgeous “girl next door” and that role catapulted her on to Hollywood’s A-list.Demi made a string of successful but rather questionable movies including Indecent Proposal, Striptease and GI Jane and demanded such high fees she was dubbed “Gimme Moore”, the sort of snarky comment that would never be made about a male actor.Her marriage to Bruce Willis made them the Brad and Angelina of their day, but just like that relationship, theirs too ended in tears and failure.Demi and Bruce went on to declare a truce and he was even at the launch of her new book in a show of support — although you do have to wonderhe had actually read what his ex had written about him.She claims that at the height of her fame he wanted her out of Hollywood so she could be a stay-at-home mum for their children.What strikes me about Demi’s story — from her being raped as a vulnerable  year old, to her complete ­mental breakdown after her marriage to Kutcher fell apart — was what a deeply unhappy le she has led.I honestly don’t know how any young girl would recover from being raped by a disgusting pervert who she claims “bought her” for a few hundred dollars from her alcoholic mother.How on Earth are you supposed to deal with such a horric betrayal from the one person who is supposed to love and protect you from harm It is very sad that Demi said she always felt that she was to blame for the appalling ordeal inflicted upon her by her mother and a man old enough to be her father.I think deep down she’s still that frightened, betrayed little girl who never thinks she is quite good enough.Demi writes movingly about being desperate to have a child with Kutcher.Shortly after their marriage she became pregnant, but tragically the baby died when she was six months pregnant.Again she blamed herself for the loss, and started drinking heavily.The relationship never really recovered. Years later ,just before the couple split, I interviewed Kutcher and it wasn’t a happy experience for all concerned.He wasn’t unpleasant, just deeply uncomfortable and clearly didn’t want to be promoting his latest project, but it was in his contract to so do.Everyone that day received monosyllabic replies and it was no surprise when the news broke shortly afterwards that his marriage to Demi had crumbled and that was when she started to really unravel.Even though on the outside Demi appeared to have everything — fame, enormous wealth, three healthy children and a handsome actor on her arm — inside she was a mass of ­anxiety and insecurities as she lurched from one crisis to the next.She came close to death a year after the split while partying with her oldest daughter Rumer. Demi suffered a seizure after taking drugs and inhaling nitrous oxide.That was a wake-up call for her to seek help and get her act together. Writing the book is apparently all part of the healing process.It won’t have been an easy read for her three grown-up daughters who, unsurprisingly, have apparently had their own issues with either substance abuse or insecurity about their bodies.I honestly do wonderanyone in Hollywood, especially those who find fame because of their good looks and winning smiles, are living happy, ­contented and fulfilled lives.It doesn’t look like it, and it’s deeply sad that a seemingly confident, extremely beautul woman such as Demi should have felt so worthless.All credit to her for coming back from the brink and having the guts to tell her story in her own words.But there is always collateral damage when you decide to be so honest, and I hope she is strong enough to weather the inevitable storms gathering on the horizon.Harry and Meghan brought out a secret weapon during their visit to South Africa and instantly blew away all the negativity and criticism they have experienced this year.With one cute smile and a whole lot of gurgles, baby Archie has completely rehabilitated his parents and shown them in a much happier and far more positive light.It is the first time we have properly seen the four month old and you do wonder why they haven’t shown him to the world before now.Everybody loves a baby, and Archie is a poppet, as well as being Harry’s absolute double.He has a sunny disposition and is obviously adored by his besotted mum and dad. The wee chap looked delighted to be on his first proper outing as a member of the royal firm.And Meghan is in her element. She appeared happy, relaxed and has managed to get her “look” just right.There were no designer frocks nor ostentatious jewellery. Instead it was all sustainable dresses, High Street shoes and lots of recycled outfits.Harry and Meghan have both shone a light on some hugely deserving causes and charities close to their hearts.They work well together, as well as being effective on their own, and it’s refreshing to hear them speak to the media like normal people, instead of the usual dry, formal speeches.It is in places such as Africa that they can both do such a lot of good and build on the pioneering charity work carried out by Harry’s late mum Princess Diana.Meghan telling young South African girls she is a woman of colour who feels like their sister means they can truly relate to her. The words were inspired and from the heart.There are rumours that in the future Harry, Meghan and Archie would spend half the year in southern Africa, and I reckon it’s a good idea.I’ve been lucky enough to visit this incredible part all of the world and it grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.Like Harry, I share a particular love of beautul Botswana, and would be delighted for themthey were lucky enough to set up a home from home there.They would be under much less pressure and scrutiny than here in the UK and able to lead almost normal lives should they so wish.Meanwhile Harry, Meghan – and especially Archie – continue with the charm offensive, breaking down barriers and becoming a force to be reckoned with.Diana would be very proud.Recycle your clothes instead of having wardrobes stuffed with cheap fashion.Stop buying plastic-wrapped fast food and maybe think about turning the bloody lights off when you leave a room.Just a thought . . .I HONESTLY think we are in imminent danger of completely losing our sense of humour and turning into a nation of po-faced bores.I couldn’t believe the reaction I got when I cheekily asked smouldering actor Jason Isaacshe was wearing shorts in an upcoming charity run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and that I would happily run behind him for the view.It was a cheeky remark made to a delightfully naughty man, who I have interviewed many times.I knew he wouldn’t be offended in the least but would laugh heartily, which is exactly what happened. I also thought it was a fun way to promote a terric cause.I was astonished to be labelled “sexist” and “inappropriate”, which is completely OTT for such innocuous remarks.People really need to get things into perspective.Dan has brought us some of the top names in TV, movies and music, covered all the big award ceremonies and always delivers the most entertaining gossip.Here’s to the next decade of scoops, scandals and showbiz shenanigans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How dare you ”Right, well in the immortal words of Samuel L Jackson: “Allow me to retort.”How dare we  No. How dare you sail to America on a carbon fibre yacht that you didn’t build which cost £million, that you didn’t earn, and which has a back-up diesel engine that you didn’t mention.I’m sorry Ms Thunberg, butyou’re going to lay into my generation, you must accept it when I lay into you and yours.What about the pills you take when you have a headache What about the clean water that comes out of your tap  What about the food you can buy at any time of the day and night No -year-old was responsible for any of that.What about the aid missions currently being run in some of the poorest countries of the world, or the drugs that help keep Aids at bay Think about all the movies you’ve enjoyed. Movies made by grown-ups. And all those comedians who’ve made you laugh.And then pause for a moment to consider how soundly you sleep at night, knowing that adults are building and servicing and flying Sweden’s fighter planes. To keep you safe.We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all.So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.And yes, you are spoilt because when you told your mum and dad to stop using planes and give up meat, they didn’t behave like sane parents and ignore you. They actually said, “Yes, dear.” And did.What they should have done is point out that le is tragic.Some people are born bright and some are born stupid.Some are beautul and some are not.Some have rich parents who give them everything but love.Some have poor parents who have nothing to give except love.Now shut up and let them get on with it.This is how the world works. It’s how the world has always worked.And banging your fists on the table won’t change a thing. You’ll learn that when you’ve got a few more years under your belt.I agree with you that the world is heating up. You may even be right that man has something to do with it.And there is no doubt that as deserts eat into currently habitable places in Africa and the Middle East, Europe will face an unimaginable refugee crisis.Something needs to be done about that. So how’s this for an idea. Get back to school as quickly as possible and work hard in your science lectures.Because science is what will solve the problem eventually. Not scowling and having screaming ab-dabs every five minutes.Many thousands of people who you had the temerity to blame this week are trying to do exactly what you want.So be a good girl, shut up and let them get on with it.And no.

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor would I not recommend them for not giving me something I want.“You ridiculous person.”The comment sparked a backlash from a number of disgruntled vegans who have waded into the row.Richard McCormick said: “Its embarrassing how aggressive the chefs approach to veganism is.“Being very rude, and excluding a huge and growing percent of the UK isnt a great business move. Hugely disappointed.”The chef hit back: “Sorry for your disappointment dick”Richard responded: “I mean, being called a dick by a chef is a little bit unprofessional.“I have an issue with the attitude this business has to the vegan communityand I think people should be made aware of this.“I am well within my right to voice this opinion. I see this far too often, Ive worked within hospitality and I see the widespread close minded attitude this industry has on vegan attitudes.“Turning customers away and refusing to cater to a customer will only get you so far.

Vegans are just better off going to a restaurant where the chef’s style is more suited to their diet.I have two other sites - Woodkraft in Cheltenham and Wood in Chester - both of which do offer vegan options as we felt it was necessary for the market.However in Manchester there are vegan options already and they will be much better suited to these diners."},{"url":null,"title":"4 lies half truths boris","story":"News lies or half-truths Boris Johnson just told on the BBCs Andrew Marr ShowBoris Johnson spent a boastful, unrepentant  minutes on our TV screens this morning - but not every word of it was entirely the truthShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video boris-johnson-squirms-hes-accused-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics -lies-half-truths-boris-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The Prime Minister kicked off the Tory conference in Manchester with a defiant -minute clash with the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show.He was probed on his links to pole-dancing businesswoman Jenner Arcuri, his language pitting MPs against the public and his Brexit plan.But in the course of the exchange he said a few things which were, well, just provably untrue. Here are  things the Prime Minister said that were either only half the truth, an accidental slip, or a deliberate lie.  The Prime Minister used the interview to repeatedly claim he would build  new hospitals. We’re announcing today that we’re going to be building  new hospitals, he said.  new hospitals as part of the biggest investment in hospital infrastructure for a generation. And I have to say that I think that is what the British people want to hear about.Yet Boris Johnson ’s promise of  ‘new hospitals’ will actually only deliver six unless the Tories win the next two elections.And it includes renovations of existing hospitals. The plans were announced last night by the PM, who claimed it was the “biggest hospital building programme in a generation.” But it will only deliver six new buildings or refurbs over the next five years. Theyaposll only promise the full they win not only the next election, but the one after that.  The Prime Minister ruled out an electoral pact with Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party. But his reason for doing so was, well, a little suspect. The Conservative Party is the oldest, greatest political party in the world, itaposs a big, broad church and we donapost do deals with other parties, he said. Reminder: The Conservative Party did a deal with the Lib Dems to govern in an austerity-wielding coalition for  years in .In , when Theresa May lost her majority, she did a £billion confidence and supply deal with Northern Irelandaposs DUP to ensure they propped up her government. And letaposs not forget local Tories. Earlier this month, Conservative councillors and the Brexit Party entered into their first pact taking control of Hartlepool Council.. aposI didnapost say humbug to death threatsapos Andrew Marr asked: So when Paula Sherrf, the Labour MP, who was a friend of Jo Cox raised the subject of death threats being made against her in the House of Commons, you describe that as ‘humbug.’The Prime Minister replied: Well that’s not true. That’s not quite right. If I can, can I just explain what I, what I... Mr Johnson went on to explain he was actually describing as humbug attempts to stop him calling a bid to delay Brexit the Surrender Act. So what were the actual words in the House of Commons chamber  Judge for yourself... PAULA SHERRIFF: I genuinely do not seek to stle robust debate, but this evening the Prime Minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an Act of Parliament that was passed by this House. I am sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to the use of offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language about legislation that we do not like.​ We stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend. Many of us in this place are subject to death threats and abuse every single day. Let me tell the Prime Minister that they often quote his words—surrender Act, betrayal, traitor—and I, for one, am sick of it. We must moderate our language, and that has to come from the Prime Minister first, so I should be interested in hearing his opinion. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself. [Applause.] BORIS JOHNSON: I have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my le. Let me just explain why I call it the surrender Act. That is because it would oblige us to stay in the EU for month after month, at a cost of a billion pounds per month. It would take away from this country the ability to decide how long that extension would be, and it would give that power to the EU. . aposIaposm a model of restraintapos  “I certainly think everyone should calm down, about his use of language, Boris Johnson said. Askedthat included him, he said: “I think I’ve been a model of restraint.” This would be the same Boris Johnson who was sacked twice for lying, talked about having a journalist beaten up, wonapost say how many children he has by how many women, endangered a British mum in Iran with careless comments, called black people piccaninnies, mocked Muslim women as letterboxes, repeatedly ignored conflict of interest rules, blew millions on a Garden Bridge aposvanity projectapos, wasted £, on illegal water cannon, and had a blazing row with his partner in her flat.

The extensions will still have to comply with building regulations but neighbours will not be able to formally object. While some are concerned about building unsightly new extensions, ministers are hoping it will allow growing families to adapt their homes so they donapost have to move. Mr Jenrick will say: The bold changes to the planning process will make a real dference to people up and down the nation.   All too often the planning system proves complicated, outdated and bureaucratic and is too complex and costly for people and small businesses to navigate. This is a barrier to building the homes that we need... I want to give families the freedom they need to expand their homes and ensure small developers get a fair chance to succeed. Our vision for reforming the planning system will speed up and simply the process, while ensuring that communities still retain a say over their future. Ministers are also hoping commercial properties can be speedily converted into residential homes.

While he has repeatedly said he will abide by the law, the Prime Minister has also insisted the UK will leave the EU on October , come what may.   A Liberal Democrat source confirmed Ms Swinson would be putting forward the idea of bringing forward the deadline for seeking an extension when she meets counterparts from Labour , the SNP , Plaid Cymru and the Greens. I expect it to be discussed at the meeting. It is certainly Joaposs intention that it should, the source told PA.Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, signalled his support for the Lib Dem plan, saying he would back any measure which prevented Mr Johnson bypassing the Benn Act.All of us have got to work together. Iaposm not precious. Everyone is much more aware of what he is capable of, he told The Daily . There is no doubt that he will seek to frustrate the legislation in place as we head towards the second half of October. A Labour source said: We are looking at all mechanisms and additional legal safeguards to block no-deal and ensure the PM complies with the Benn Act. The move could see Tory MPs and ministers forced to abandon their party conference in Manchester and dash back to Westminsterthe opposition stage an ambush to seize control of the Commons agenda. Unusually, the Commons is sitting during conference after MPs refused to grant the Government the customary recess in the bitter aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling that Mr Johnsonaposs suspension of Parliament was unlawful.    The latest plan comes after the SNP failed to win support for a tabling no-confidence motion with a view to forming an interim governmentthey succeeded in toppling Mr Johnson.Under the proposal, the temporary administration would have sought an extension from the EU and then immediately called a general election .However the other parties were wary, amid concerns Mr Johnson could have tried to hang on in No  and delay an election until after October  by which time Britain would be out.There were also sharp dference between the parties over who would lead such a government.Jeremy Corbyn has said that, as the leader of the biggest opposition party in the Commons, he should have first crack at forming an administration - a position broadly supported by the SNP. However Ms Swinson has been adamant that she would not be prepared to put the Labour leader in No .Her view is shared by many of the rebel Tory MPs who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit and whose votes would be neededthe plan was to succeed.Some MPs have suggested that a more consensual figure such as Ken Clarke or Dame Margaret Beckett could stand a better chance of uniting the parties. Other ideas floating around Westminster include tabling another bill to enable Commons Speaker John Bercow to seek an extension from BrusselsMr Johnson refuses to do so.

Mr Hammond, one of  Tories who lost the whip for trying to block no-deal, wrote: As [the PMaposs] sister has reminded us, he is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit. And there is only one outcome that works for them: a crash-out no-deal Brexit that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring.    The allegation has been prominent for around three weeks following an article by the Byline website. The Byline article highlighted donations to the Tories by financiers who are also betting against - aposshortingapos - certain firms or aspects of the economy.It is certainly true that some financiers taking short positions have donated to the Tories or Boris Johnson . Crispin Odey, who made £m overnight as sterling slumped in the  referendum, is one, and the Mirror has reported on him previously.However, fact-checking website Full Fact said the Byline article had used incomplete data and it was unable to identy a sharp rise in short positions that was alleged. The Financial Times also argued the full picture was more complicated, with financiers taking many positions at one time and not only betting over Brexit.  Mr Young, however, not only said the theory was untrue but went a large step further. In a now-deleted tweet, he described it as Hammondaposs disgusting anti-Semitic conspiracy theory: Boris is being manipulated by a secret cabal of city financiers who stand to profit from economic ruin. Mr Hammondaposs original article on Saturday did not mention Jews or Judaism. The former Chancellor hit back sharply, saying: This is self-evidently absurd. But it is also defamatory. I will be taking legal advice tomorrow morning. I shall make no further comment.

Just  days out from the Prime Minister’s ‘do or die’ deadline, almost everyone is in the dark about how Boris Johnson intends to drag Britain out of the EU on Halloween and still obey the law. Even senior cabinet ministers claim not to know what the PM has in mind for the end of October. So this morning, ahead of his big speech at Tory conference in Manchester, Sajid Javid was asked repeatedly what the plan is.    The Benn Act, passed earlier this month by MPs, demands the PM ask the EU for a Brexit extensionwe don’t have a deal by October . Askedhe knew how the Government would get around the Benn Act, he replied: I think I do. The intention of the law is clear and I do think it has absolutely made it harder for the Government to get the deal that we all want to see. That said, it can still be done. Itaposs not about getting around the law ... I donapost really want to discuss the detail of this law, itaposs a pretty fresh new law, but we are also clear at all times we, of course, like any government, we will absolutely observe the law.    In the course of several media interviews, Mr Javid not only refused to say what Mr Johnson’s plan was, but said it would not be right” for the public to be aware of something that will have a material effect on their lives for decades to come, just four weeks before it happens. AskedBrexit is still possible by Halloween, he told Today: Yes, it is. Itaposs not our preferred outcome, we are working incredibly hard to get a deal by October  and I absolutely believe that can still happen. Butwe do not manage to do that, we do still need to leave the EU on that date - we cannot have any more dither and delay and we will leavewe have to without a deal on October . And Mr Javid dismissed former Tory minister Justine Greeningaposs calls for Brexit plans to be published. He told Today: The absolute worst negotiating strategy in the world would be to publicly negotiate. Itaposs a ridiculous suggestion.aposapos  Mr Javid said he was not sure how much a no-deal Brexit would cost the economy in the short term. He told Today: I donapost think anyone really knows a full proper answer to that question. And I have never pretended thatyou leave without a deal it wonapost be challenging.aposapos  Labouraposs John McDonnell accused Mr Javid of either having no clue or being completely disingenuous about not knowing the cost of a no-deal Brexit. The shadow chancellor said: The Chancellor refused to say what the real costs of a no-deal Brexit would be, or how it would impact on the economy. He either has no clue or he is being completely disingenuous, because he knows what a disaster no deal would be for everyone except the super rich. His repetition of the word surrender is no substitute for grown-up, sensible planning. Aside from his reluctance to provide vital information on a matter of national importance, the Chancellor was eager to tell people he plans to spend billions on transport and broadband infrastructure. He’s set to open the taps in a bid to fulfil Boris Johnsonaposs unfunded leadership campaign pledges. Projects include £billion for the roll-out of full-fibre, G fast internet £billion of already-announced cash to upgrade roads over the next five years and a £-million National Bus Strategy to overhaul services, including the creation of Britain’s first ever all-electric bus town.

In fact it was the Queen Mother who was always late down for dinner, and it got so bad that the Queen came up with a cheeky trick to make sure her mum was sitting at the table in time when the family were in Balmoral for their summer holidays. According to former royal chef Darren McGrady, who cooked for the Monarch, Prince Philip, Princess Diana and William and Harry during his career with the Royal Household, the family and staff used to tell her a little white lie every evening.    In an interview with Marie Claire he revealed: Dinner was at :pm in Balmoral when Her Majesty the Queen Mother was in attendance.

In the nine months since they have had  visits from developer Taylor Wimpey to look at the issues.     We told Taylor Wimpey as soon as we found the problem with the fridge freezer, but at first they wouldnapost replace it, said Angus. I argued about that and eventually they gave us a new freezer. Since then we have had  separate visits to repair  dferent problems. The kitchen was poorly fitted, the outside light didnapost work, the loft installation had to be fixed over five dferent visits, the drain has broken outside, the flooring was badly fitted upstairs along with the carpet. On top of that, the patio doors wouldnapost lock and the wardrobe was falling over. They have fixed those now but they were simple little things and itaposs taken more than eight months to sort out.

He added: They confirmed that there was a problem with the damp course and said it was Taylor Wimpeyaposs responsibility to sort it a few months ago. Taylor Wimpey agreed to carry out a survey, but we donapost seem to be able to get any further towards getting the issue resolved. The couple are so desperate to move out they asked Taylor Wimpey to buy the house off them so they can move in somewhere . Itaposs not fit for purpose because of the ground level and the faulty damp course. It shouldnapost have been passed off in the first place, Angus added. But Taylor Wimpey has said they donapost have a legal responsibility to buy back the property and that we should sell the home ourselves, but we canapost sell this to somebody when we know that there are faults. Weaposre in an overwhelming situation where Taylor Wimpey are willing for us to put the house on the market when they are aware that itaposs not right. Itaposs a serious situation.

They wanted to know about the venue, the decorations, the reception, the guestlist - but of course the most interesting detail with every wedding is the brideaposs dress. Like all women preparing to walk down the aisle, Kate wanted to keep the designer creating her dress a secret and did everything she could to keep the details out of the press.    But there was a leak and the name of the woman behind the dress - Alexander McQueenaposs Sarah Burton - got out in the lead up to the big day. Speaking on Channel  documentary Secrets of the Royal Dressmakers, royal expert Katie Nicholl discussed how much this upset the future Duchess of Cambridge. She said: Behind the scenes I think that caused tears at the Palace because Kate had done everything she could to keep the wedding dress a secret.At the time, The Sunday Times  reported: A fashion source said that the dress will be a combination of Middletonaposs own design ideas and Burtonaposs deep knowledge and understanding of high fashion.   Burton, of course, denied any involvement until she was officially announced as the designer when Kate stepped out of the car in front of Westminster Abbey. And the leak didnapost seem to bother Kate on the big day. She was the most beautul bride and she couldnapost have looked happier to marry her prince. Her dress - a stunning ivory gown with a satin bodice and lace sleeves - was a huge hit with fashion critics and fans around the world.Burton attended the royal wedding and styled Kateaposs dress before she walked down the aisle, making sure everything was perfect.    Wedding dress designer Caroline Castigliano says the big reveal was still special, even though the designer had been leaked.She said: Everybody loved Kate’s dress.

The attention to detail was breathtaking – from the hand-cut Chantilly lace of the sleeves, to the lace applique on the bodice and the inidual lace roses, thistles, daffodils and shamrocks hand-engineered on to the ivory silk tulle. The skirt was crafted with white satin gazar arches and pleats to echo an opening flower. And the weight of the silk tulle underskirt and .m train ensured it glided along.

The chef made the jibe as he responded to reviews complaining about his restaurantaposs lack of vegan options. He also called another commenter a d**k after they said his aggressive approach to veganism was embarassing. Mr Wood hit back after Jake Norris left a review on the Wood Restaurant Group Facebook page, the Manchester Evening News reported. Mr Norris wrote about the Manchester eatery: “Chef can’t adapt to cook vegan food! Poor! Disappointing food.” In response Mr Wood wrote: “Hi Jake, this is Simon Wood it’s not a given that I should adapt my menu to suit your preference.    “If you want vegan food go to a vegan restaurant... which incidentallyI went to one and asked for a steak I wouldn’t get one. Nor would I expect to do so. Nor would I not recommend them for not giving me something I want. You ridiculous person.” The comment caused a backlash from several vegans who have now waded into the row. Among them was Richard McCormick who wrote: “Itaposs embarrassing how aggressive the chefaposs approach to veganism is. Being very rude, and excluding a huge and growing percent of the UK isnapost a great business move. Hugely disappointed.”  In response Mr Wood simply wrote: “Sorry for your disappointment d**k” Mr McCormick responded: “I mean, being called a d**k by a chef is a little bit unprofessional. “I have an issue with the attitude this business has to the Vegan communityand I think people should be made aware of this. I am well within my right to voice this opinion. I see this far too often, Iaposve worked within hospitality and I see the widespread close minded attitude this industry has on vegan attitudes. “Turning customers away and refusing to cater to a customer will only get you so far. Ten years down the line when people realise how cruel your industry is, how many animals have died to satisfy your taste buds, you will be sat with an empty restaurant.” In response Wood Restaurant Group wrote: “cheers Dick . I’ll worry about it in ten years then.... Have a great weekend.”    Several vegans have waded into the row. Keshia Laurie Saunders wrote of the restaurantaposs Facebook page: “Doesnapost even offer one vegan option. Horrendous.” While Natascha Cofait added: “Doesn’t cater to my dietwhich is obviously a huge barrier but doesn’t bother me so much. What I’m more concerned about is the rude responses from Wood’s brand ambassadors. Will most certainly be actively deterring omni friends from this restaurant.” Karen Hayley wrote: “In terms of improvement, the chef could refrain from abusing his customers in public for legitimate enquiries about the food. “Small menu · Disappointing food” While Sam Waddington wrote: “Appalling attitude towards dietary requirements.”  And Jake Alex Li added: “Rude and unprofessional, avoid.” However one diner spoke out to defend the restaurant and its owner. Candy Naomi Leo wrote: “Great restaurant, great food. Great owner. “Ignore all the latest feedback from aposvegansapos who are attention seeking and trying to sabotage woods restaurant!” Restaurant bosses said they do not believe any of the reviewers have actually dined at Wood.

Lily-Fay Parfitt was left screaming in agony with le-changing wounds to her cheek and lip when the dog attacked without warning as she played on her auntaposs farm earlier this month. Mum Kelly Parfitt claims surgeons ranked the nine-year-oldaposs injuries as a . out of  on an injury severity scale. The little girl has been left unable to hear out of her right ear or close her right eye fully, with  stitches needed to close the wounds on her face. Lily-Fay will be scarred for le her mum said, with her two younger brothers who witnessed the attack left traumatised by the incident and terried of unfamiliar dogs.    Mum-of-five Kelly is warning people that all dog breeds can be dangerous and to keep pets on short leads around children. Kelly, from Southwater in West Sussex, said: Itaposs le changing for Lily, she canapost smile as sheaposs lost her lips. What I can see of her lip at the moment is that itaposs really jagged, like a jigsaw piece. Weaposve taken all mirrors down and covered the one in the bathroom up so she canapost see her reflection.    I think sheaposs going to be shocked because sheaposs very into photos and selfies. I feel like Iaposm in a daze, itaposs like Iaposm in a dream. I think Iaposll wake up and it will be a bad nightmare but clearly itaposs not going to happen. Itaposs still so raw. Lily has been so brave. Sheaposs also having night terrors. She wonapost go anywhere without me at all times. Sheaposs doing alright, but I donapost think itaposs hit her yet. Itaposs all covered up so she canapost see it. Whencomes off is when itaposs going to seem real to her.    Kelly was supervising Lily-Fay while she played with her cousins and siblings after school on her auntaposs farm in Pulborough, West Sussex. Full-time carer Kelly noticed a dog owner had left their pet tied up. The dog made a beeline for Lily-Fay and launched an unprovoked on the girl, Kelly claimed, biting her mouth and cheek. Kelly said: Lily saw the dog and stopped and turned, she didnapost even step towards the dog.    Lily didnapost even make a beeline and go running towards it, she stopped in her tracks and turned towards the dog - we werenapost that far away. The dog actually came straight to her. I heard an ear-piercing scream as it grabbed her top lip and tore out her cheek, leaving catastrophic wounds. My mum got to her before I did because I had her baby brother in my arms, she told me aposdonapost come nearapos and pushed me away. The injuries to Lilyaposs face is something that I never want to see again. Her top jaw, her top teeth, her tongue and bottom jaw had been degloved.    Lily-Fay had  stitches on the outside of her cheek to hold it together,  stitches in her lip and an unknown number inside her cheek. The dog took off so much skin that the young girl lost  percent of her top lip. Surgeons were concerned that stitching her up too tightly may leave her mouth drooping. It was the th time Lily-Fay has been under the kne, because she was born with a rare birth defect whcih means she has a horseshoe-shaped kidney and just  percent of her bowel. Despite now facing three weeks off school to prevent infection, the youngster is determined to keep up with her school work and Kelly claims she even managed to smile again last week. Kelly said: The surgeon took one look at her and said apositaposs le changing, we donapost knowshe will get senses back because of the severity of the injuryapos.    She has slight hearing loss out of her ear which we donapost knowit is going to come back. She canapost close her eye fully at night time, so theyaposre going to put eye drops in to stop her eye from drying out. Sheaposs already had so much going on in her little le as it is, sheaposs doing really well. The incident was reported to Sussex Police and Kelly claims the dog has since been put to sleep. Kelly said: As far as I am aware the dog has been destroyed. I wouldnapost wish this on anyone, but itaposs happened to the child who has already gone through  operations in her le because of her rare birth defect.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last week issued a special report on oceans and cryosphere, the frozen parts of the planet such as the ice caps and glaciers. It is a sobering read. A combination of the work of  climate scientists from  countries with reference to , inidual reports and over , expert comments, it asks the question of what will happengreenhouse gas emissions do not fall rapidly.    Sea levels are rising twice as fast as during the th century as the melting of the largest ­ice reservoirs accelerates, leading to extreme weather patterns and dwindling marine le. But far worse impacts will hit without urgent action to cut fossil fuel emissions, including an eventual sea level rise of more than four metres in the worst case – an outcome that would redraw the map of the world and harm billions of people. The ramications of climate change are most pronounced in the world’s coldest regions, such as the Arctic, which is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet – where I travelled last month to witness the impact firsthand. Every warning in the report can be found here.    A record C heatwave in the summer led to record ice-melting, pushing up sea levels with the impact felt all over. Worryingly, I found out it is not just the ice that is melting. The Arctic’s large layer of frozen ground, called permafrost, is thawing more quickly than scientists anticipated – another looming crisis. Globally permafrost holds , gigatons of CO and methane – a greenhouse gas  times more potent than CO – twice the amount in the atmosphere.    In Greenland, permafrost thawing is already taking its toll on the local community with collapsing buildings and more frequent landslides. It is estimated half of homes in the northwestern part of the island will need to be pulled down in  years as a result of the rapid melt. But scientists have warned there is still much to be learnt about the implications of this change – affecting an area twice the size of the USA – yet only a small amount is monitored.

Breaks do not even get considered.” Nursing Standard editor Flavia Munn said: “It will probably shock those outside of the NHS to hear many nurses go through an entire sht without even a sip of water. “But nurses start work almost expecting to end their day feeling exhausted and dehydrated, having gone without a break. “Our survey shows staff working to the bone in a health service that is understaffed and overworked.” Nursing shortages have risen to , vacancies in England alone since then-Chancellor George Osborne abolished bursaries for would-be nurses and replaced them with student loans in .  Kim Sunley, of the RCN, said: “We are aware access to breaks is a problem, and it is a symptom of the wider issue around nursing shortages.

The FBI has expanded its investigation to identy alleged human trafficking victims of late American billionaire Epstein, who could provide information on the Duke, The Sunday Times has reported. The paper says the US law enforcement agency expects to interview alleged trafficking victims over the next two months and that Scotland Yard is ready to assist. It comes as claims emerged that a whistleblower told French police that Prince Andrew was a regular visitor to a £million Paris property where Epstein abused young women. The caretaker of the billionaireaposs Paris property, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told The Sun: I saw Prince Andrew there.  The source, who has been the caretaker since Epstein bought the home in the early s, said: Prince Andrew stayed at the address a number of times when Epstein was not there. Investigators have reportedly said the apartment has been searched and everyone associated with Epstein will need to be spoken to. Reports say Prince Andrew has previously said: At no stage during the limited time I spent with him [Epstein] did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman toldthey would not be commenting on the latest claims.  Citing unidentied sources from the US Department of Justice, the Times says the FBI are looking to several potential victims in the hope they can provide more details about Prince Andrew and his involvement in the Epstein case. The report quotes former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard, Dai Davies, saying a full investigation would be in Prince Andrewaposs best interests. I would have thought itaposs in Prince Andrewaposs interests to clear this matter up, Mr Davies, who headed Prince Andrewaposs protection in the late s, told The Sunday Times. Any residue of doubt or innuendo should be cleared up by a clear, unequivocal, structured investigation. Scotland Yard had previously held an investigation after one of the women caught up in the scandal, Virginia Giuffre, made allegations against the Duke of York, but that probe was dropped in . Her allegations, which Andrew strongly denies, were struck from US civil court records in  after a judge said they were immaterial and impertinent.

In , Meghan Markle was slowly becoming a household name as she entered her second season of Suits. Despite appearing to enjoy her new found fame. Judi told : Meghanaposs eye expression looks flat or even dead.    She’s narrowed her eyes to add to the sexy look but there’s none of the excitement and engagement we see so frequently now”. It appears that Meghan is also felt uncomfortable in her own skin as Meghan’s hand and her hanging arm seem set to cover her body rather than reveal it.”    By  rumours were circulating that Meghan and Harry had met and were dating. This relationship apparently “couldn’t have come soon enough for the Suits actress” as she might not have been completely happy or motivated” as a Hollywood actress. Despite still acting at this point, it seem Meghan was already slipped into her royal persona.  Judi says that As she leaves the red carpet though we can see the ‘performance’ drop and a glimpse of a Meghan that is far more familiar to royal watchers…doing her signature exit: a cute, low-status ‘baby wave’ that suggests she wants to be liked”.

Manny Fontenla Novoa chilled out with his family at the plush property in July as Thomas Cook struggled against mounting debts. The fat cat father-of-four pocketed £million during his controversial four years at the bust travel giant. Spanish property records show Manny, who quit Thomas Cook in  following a series of profit warnings, plunging share prices and the carbon monoxide deaths of two British children, has put the Costa Blanca hideaway in doting we Lesley’s name. Thomas Cookaposs debt stood at £ million, with annual interest charges of £ million when he left.  Neighbours said the couple holiday at the luxury property, in a quiet cul-de-sac in hills near the upmarket resort of Javea, up to three times a year. The gated five-bed hideaway, which lies in the shadow of the stunning ,ft Montgo mountain, boasts a large infinity pool overlooking pine woods below and two chill-out areas with a pergola and BBQ. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: “They were here in July with family. “They come about three times a year. People round here knows Manny used to be a Thomas Cook boss but it’s not something we ask about.” A Brit expat who knows him added: “I suspect he’ll be keeping his head down next time he’s over for a bit of RR.  “He’s always struck me as a nice enough bloke and he’s not the flashy type when he’s holidaying here but you can imagine people giving him griefthey’ve been caught up in some of the mess he’s been blamed for.” There was no answer at the door of the Galician-born travel chief’s holiday home over the weekend and the shutters on the windows were pulled down, although a maintenance man appeared to be working on the pool. The -year-old former Thomas Cook chief executive, one of a trio of fat cats who creamed off £ million in pay and perks before the travel firm sank under £. million of debt, is still selling holidays to Brits as president of online travel agency Logitravel Group.  He sold a sprawling country mansion he owned with his we in Surrey for £million in  but they also have a £million pound flat in central London as well as their Spanish home. Mr Fontenla Novoa, whose real first name is Jesus Manuel, has admitted to being nicknamed Manny after the blundering Fawlty Towers waiter played by the late Andrew Sachs. Claiming he was worried about the firm’s future when biggest single shareholder Fosun was still trying to conclude a rescue deal, he said before the collapse: “Thomas Cook will always be in my heart and I know many people at the firm, especially in the shops. “I’ve been worried but I was confident the company wouldn’t fail. In fact I had shares in Thomas Cook and didn’t sell them. That shows I was confident a solution would be reached.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first time I laid eyes on Kilmartin Castle was in . An article popped up on my newsfeed with an intriguing headline: ‘Buy a Scottish Castle for the same price as a London parking space!’ I clicked on it, scrolling though the pictures and showing my partner Simon. We’d just got back from a winter trip to the Highlands, and had fallen in love with the place. With the cosy fires in every pub and beautul landscape, it was a world away from Dubai, where we were living at the time. I was half-joking when I showed Simon the article, but soon we were researching the area and dreaming of the move. We were tired of le in the UAE, where I worked as a radio presenter and Simon worked in advertising. We knewwe could handle the dreary Scottish weather in January and still love the place, we could relocate there. We flew to see Kilmartin and from that moment we knew we had to live there.    It was stunning – a th century castle set in huge grounds, two hours from Glasgow, with a pub and a deli in a nearby village. It was run-down and needed a lot of work – the whole place had been shut up for years and smelt strongly of damp, and the interior was basic. It had been a ruin for  years, with trees growing up through the floors and no roof. But in the s a hiking stone mason spotted the ruins and vowed to rescue it. Every summer for  years he stayed in a caravan in the grounds and got it to shack level, making three bedrooms and one bathroom. The castle was on the market for £, and we sat in a cafe agonising about what to offer in the sealed bid. There were a few people interested and we worried whether we were bidding high enough. As we walked out of the cafe a bird pooed on Simon, taking it as a sign, we bid at £, – and won! We were over the moon.    No lenders wanted to offer us a mortgage for a -year-old building, so we had to get an offshore company to give us the money – but only on %. We had nowhere near the £, we needed, so we took out a huge loan in Dubai, and applied for multiple credit cards. It was a bit mad and the interest each month was frightening.  Needing to earn money to pay our debts, we had to go back to Dubai. But not before giving the castle a lick of paint and airing it out. We put it on Air BB for £ a night for the whole castle, and it filled up quickly. In  we got married at Kilmartin. We had a teepee in the garden with a roaring fire. It was magical to get married at our own castle, surrounded by loved ones, but we had to go back to Dubai to carry on paying our debts. It was two more years before we were in a position to quit our jobs and leave. We spent six months travelling in our van through France, Norway, Spain and Belgium, picking up furniture for the castle, huge mirrors, paintings and chests. My favourite pieces were an ostrich egg lamp from France that ended up costing us a fortune to rewire, and a painting of a bearded lady that had hung in a famous Paris club in the s.  In January this year, we began a renovation project. We were quoted £, and the builders told us work would be completed by June, so we began to take bookings. I shouldn’t have believed them… Living in our van, we began demolishing the stud walls ourselves while the builders finished work nearby. It was hard graft and Simon and I both lost weight. With no running water, we couldn’t shower and we ended up wearing the same clothes for days at a time. It was freezing in the van, and often the highlight of our day was a trip to the tip.  I remember saying six days before my birthday, ‘All I want for my birthday is a shower,’ but I didn’t get one for another  days! There were problems: the fire safety approval didn’t come through in time for us to put in the mezzanine levels, so we had to abandon the steel supports we’d installed. We had to pull up all the flagstones and break through concrete to get rid of the damp under the floor. Everything over-ran, and we had to cancel our first month’s booking, losing £,. Plus, we went £, over budget – we were back in debt with loans. But slowly, it took shape.  We added two more bedrooms and two more bathrooms, including a shower in the turret – one of my favourite things. We tried to decorate with things that make you happy to be in a room with them. Everything just came together, despite all our decisions being made after pm, in the van, hungry and freezing. Finally, it was finished in late July. We had back-to-back bookings of the whole castle for two months, so we haven’t spent a night there yet.

Trams in the capital of Santa Cruz grounded to a halt and around  people had to be rescued from lts by fire crews after the power went down at around pm today. Around one million people are estimated to have been affected by the blackout  - although airports were reportedly not affected after generators kicked in. Despite initial reports pointing to an incident in Candalaria, the power cut was later blamed on an explosion at a sub-station in Granadilla in the south of the island. A map released by power company e-distribucion shows how the blackout affected the entire country, which is part of the Canary Islands. Matthew Ward, , and his we Nicola, , from Goole, Yorkshire, said they havenapost eaten since am this morning after shops and restaurants were forced to shut due to the power cut.

The couple were on the second day of their week-long break on the island when the power went down. Matthew told the : We went for a walk this morning to Los Cristianos for breakfast and as we walked back just nipped into the shop. The woman said she couldnapost serve us as the power had gone out and then as we walked back this bloke was saying the power was out for km. When we got back to the hotel the power was off her and there was only cold food being served but most of it had gone.    At one point the staff were trying to cook on coals and the sprinklers came on inside and soaked them Now, when you look out to where the bars are everyone’s on the beach but it’s deadly quiet.

Mains electricity began to be restored to parts of the island this afternoon, but scores of areas are still without any power as the sun is close to setting on the islandTram bosses in the capital Santa Cruz tweeted around .pm local time they were “slowly” beginning to re-establish normal service. A receptionist at the three-star Hotel Catalonia Oro Negro said the mains electricity was down but the hotel was ing as normal with generators.  A receptionist at the Jardin Tropical Hotel in the neighbouring Adeje said the blackout was causing some problems and the air conditioning at the hotel was not working but “thankfully all the lts were working” and there were no major calamities. A Spanish bar owner in Los Cristianos said: “I’m not affected because there’s a generator in the building where the bar is but a lot of bars and restaurants in the area are without electricity and will have had to close. “The blackout happened just before lunch so it couldn’t have occurred at a worst time.”  Brit Debbie Moyse, manager at the Cozy Cafe in Playa de Las Americas, added: “I reckon I’m going to lose around , euros in food alone. “I’ve got four large-stand up freezers and seven catering fridges in the kitchen and everything in there will have to be thrown away. “We’re well-known in the area for our Sunday lunches and we haven’t been able to serve any hot food since around pm. “All I can serve are cakes and cold drinks till the ice melts.  “At the moment I’ve got  people on the terrace getting stuck into the sangria while another customer has managed to put on some music through his phone. “I’ve been in Tenere for five years and have never heard of a blackout this size.

It will have a workshop where locals can have their bikes maintained, and a cafe with river-facing views.The building – designed in the same dramatic vein as VA Dundee – will also have public toilets for visitors to use.At the edge of the site closest to the Tay, the urban beach aims to “reinforce the city’s connection” with the river – and provide an extra family-friendly attraction which could drive new visitors to the Waterfront.Site designers Optimised Environmentsenvisage Waterfront Place being used by visitors at all times of the day.To that end, they have included night-time lighting that lines the footpaths and also illuminates water features.Summarising the proposals in a document included with the planning application, Open said: “Waterfront Place represents one of the final pieces of infrastructure within the central Waterfront masterplan.“It offers the opportunity to create a powerful space that is both dynamic and playful, that consciously addresses the River Tay and Dundee’s relationship to its maritime environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"show celebrating music of george michael coming to dundees caird hall next year","story":"A show celebrating the music of George Michael will stop at Dundee#s Caird Hall for one night.Featuring the voice of Rob Lamberti, as well as the National Philharmonic Concert Orchestra and members of George Michael#s original band the show, entitled George, will perform in the city on May  .Premiering earlier this year in venues around the UK, George tells the story of the iconic music star in a vast repertoire of songs.Rob Lamberti, who features in the upcoming Steve Coogan film #Greed# also took part in the BBC#s #Even Better Than the Real Thing# in . vw, px\"  David Baptiste and Carlos Hercules, who performed with George for years, will join Rob in this #unique, definitive and powerful celebration# of the singer#s music.LHG Live are presenting the show in association with Derek Nicol and Paul Walden for Flying High.Liz Doogan-Hobbs MBE, CEO of LHG Live said: “We are delighted to be bringing yet another concert to Dundee off the back of the hugely successful summer of LHG Live produced and promoted concerts in this wonderful city.#The George Tour has enjoyed immense success across the UK, and we have no doubt that it will prove popular not just with George Michael fans in Dundee but with anyone who is looking for a brilliant night out.#George Michael remains one of the most iconic music stars to come out of the UK, and the George tour is a true celebration of his brilliance.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

The centre was inspired by Catherine and her husband John after their experiences when John contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome.#I thought the notion of collecting crisp packets was brilliant, said Catherine, so I mentioned it to Michael one day.##Catherine suggested the crisp packet idea to me one day when I was in the Salty Dog Cafe,# explained Michael.After discussing it with teachers it was all systems go. Head girl Eilidh Logan designed snazzy posters to go around the school and the bags poured in.Michael concluded: #Collecting crisp bags is just so easy to do, and we are supporting recycling, prevention of littering and charity benefits too.#If you want to donate crisp bags, there are a number of collection points around Mid Argyll. Aside from Lochgilphead High School, you could hand them in to Mid Argyll Community Pool, Mid Argyll Sports Centre, Argyll Insurance in Lochgilphead, the MS and Dochas centres, Lochgilphead Community Centre and the Tayvallich Inn."},{"url":null,"title":"first round blow for depleted star","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star travelled to Barrhead last Saturdayto play Newlands in the West of Scotland Cup.

Drawing in a crowd from across Mid Argyll the band put on show to remember but it was just as memorable for the band. A sea of die-hard fans, in Robert Robertson masks, certainly took the singer by surprise as the group made their way to the front of the stage for a dance.The gig was in aid of Clachan Village Hall and organisers were thrilled that the concert was once again a sold-out event.The local pubs and hotels were quickly filled up to continue the party. As a warm up for their main stage gig on Sunday, The Mad Ferret Band drew in the crowds at The Corner House, while Gubbed had the Islay Frigate dance floor well used as they rocked the night away.The jam session in the harbour marquee on Saturday afternoon brought together a host of musicians, while a fantastic £. for festival funds was raised at the coffee morning held at Templar Arts and Leisure Centre.The Mad Ferret Band eased the Sunday survivors into the day’s event at the quay but it was not long before the crowd were back on their feet dancing and singing along. The great musical entertainment continued throughout the afternoon with performance from Gary Innes and Rhuvaal.Speaking after the weekend-long event, organiser Margaret MacNeill said: #Thanks to everybody who helped out with the coffee morning. Special thanks also to all the bands and everyone who came to support Tarbert Music Festival. Saturday was busier than ever, helped by the good weather.#Tide Lines brought something special to the weekend and the gig was sold out well in advance, so look out for more ticketed events in future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow health wrangle could add 1m to argyll overspend","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn overspend of more than £million is being forecast by health chiefs in Argyll and Bute for the current financial year – but health services are currently almost half a million in the black.The biggest threat to the year-end spending figures is a long-running dispute with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde over charges for services.The figures were revealed in a report presented to members of the area’s Health and Social Care Partnershipintegration joint boardon Wednesday September .The HSCP was operating at an overspend of £, as of July , but while £, has been overspent on social work services, health has an underspend of £,.The vast majority of the projected overspend for   is on social work, at £.m, with a further £.m forecast to be overspent on health.Addressing the figures for the year to date, head of finance and transformation Judy Orr said: #Within health delivered services, the underspend is mainly due to successful appeal of rateable values following the last revaluation, rebates received and vacancy savings.#There are overspends on adult services linked to savings not being achieved in addition to increased costs for agency locum staff and GP prescribing.#There is also an overspend as we have not yet met our target for slippage on budget reserves which includes one-off, in-year allocations.#Within social work the overspends are mainly on learning disability joint residential and supported living and physical disability supported living arising due to service demands.#Within learning disability, the iance is caused by a failure to deliver planned savings along with spend above budgeted levels.#There are some offsetting underspends on central management costs within children and families and child protection due to staffing underspends and some slippage on expenditure and underspends on adult services central management costs due to phasing and reduced demand.#Efforts have been made in July to phase budgets more closely in line with historic patterns of expenditure and expected trends and to increase the correlation with the forecast.#On health, the underspend has increased by £, and continues the trend experienced in the first quarter. The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

The latest issue involves the upgrading of the telephone appointment system where non-urgent appointments are not available until October .ldquoThe major issue is actually getting an appointment within a reasonable period. We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area. However, it must be stressed thata patient needs to see a healthcare professional urgently, then they will do.ldquoWe appreciate that change in the way services are provided can take a period of time to settle in however, we know from patient feedback that we are getting it right, and this is reflected by the fact that we have received complaints from only . per cent of patients this year.ldquoWe know that the signicant majority of our patients have a positive experience of healthcare through Riverside."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10361420.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"face-face-glasgow-born-downton-abbey-composer-john-lunn","story":"But there are some days when the -year-old Scot really does feel a little giddy at it all. One came earlier this month when he was flown to New York and, suited and booted, invited to walk the red carpet at the star-studded US premiere of the film version of Downton Abbey, everyonersquos favourite Edwardian upstairs downstairs romp.ldquoIt was spectacular, he says, still sounding a little awestruck. ldquoThey had a fantastic party afterwards in the Plaza Hotel, opposite Central Park. I still do pinch myself a little bit, I have to say.Lunnrsquos compositions have been a staple of Downton Abbey since it first aired in . He has scored each of its six series as well as the film version, which is set in  and finds the Crawley family entertaining King George V and his we Queen Mary. It was for his work on the blockbuster series that he won the two Emmys, the first in in , the second the following year. It also brought him a Royal Television Award for Best Score though in its way the accolade bestowed on him by Classic FM is perhaps most telling of the lot: in a  listenersrsquo poll of the best TV theme ever written, Lunnrsquos Downton Abbey Theme came top.Looking back, Lunn admits to being ldquoquite surprised at how well liked Downton Abbey was when the first series aired .ldquoI thought it would do well because the production values really were pretty high, it looked good, there was some great acting and it was well written, he says. ldquoBut like everybody  I was a bit surprised that the subject material would prove to be so popular. Irsquod done things like Little Dorrit [] and Bleak House [], Dickens adaptations which were enormously successful here and in America, and I thoughtit does as well as either of them, thatrsquoll be great. Irsquoll be perfectly happy with that. Little did I know it would eclipse both of them by some distance.But while nobody now doubts the power of the series on the small screen, it still wasnrsquot a given that it would translate well to the multiplex.ldquoWhat everybody was concerned about was whether we could motivate an audience who was used to seeing it on a Sunday evening to go to the cinema, says Lunn. ldquoBut amazingly, that seems to have happened.And how. When the film was released in the US it beat both Brad Pittrsquos Ad Astra and Sylvester Stallonersquos Rambo: Last Blood to top the box office, taking  millionin its opening weekend and setting a new record for what industry bible Variety terms a ldquospecialty studio . The reviews werenrsquot bad either.Lunn has lived most of his adult le in London but he was born in Glasgow in , grew up in Bridge of Allan from the age of five and attended Stirling High School. Although born to musical parents ndash his father had played in a jazz band in the s ndash he came late to playing music himself.ldquoBecause my father had been a sax player there was a lot of music in the house. At the age of  or  I was kind of absorbing it all and I got into a lot of the rock music that was around then, like Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix. My dad suggested I take up an instrument and I heard Paul Tortelier playing the cello on the television and thought lsquoThat sounds quite interestingrsquo.He asked at school and was told there was no chance of cello lessons, buthe wanted he could try the double bass instead. He decided to give it a shot. He was  at the time, quite old to be taking up an instrument.ldquoAs soon as I started I just knew. I got really good at it really quickly. I took up piano lessons about six months later and after that nobody could stop me. Nobody had to tell me to practice.ldquoTo be honest, I think I was a bit unhappy before that. Those early years at secondary school are quite dficult and I didnrsquot quite know where I fitted in. I was scrabbling around looking for something to hold on to and music provided that in abundance. I just went with it.His next move, then, was a no-brainer: Glasgow University where, aged , he studied music and threw himself and his double bass into the cityrsquos music scene. At one point he played in a band with Craig Armstrong, now also a noted composer of film scores.In  Lunn was offered a publishing contract with Chrysalis Records and moved to London. He has lived in the city ever since. For a few years he became, as he puts it, ldquoa bit involved in pop music but his preferred outlet was a series of bands he describes as ldquoexperimental. The most notable was Man Jumping, an electro-jazz fusion group signed to EG Records, also home to Brian Eno, Robert Fripp and Penguin Cafeacute Orchestra.He wrote his first score for television in , for a BBC play called The Gt, and throughout the early s he continued to write for long-forgotten series such as Backup and The Ghostbusters Of East Finchley. Then, in , came his big break: Hamish Macbeth, an amiable BBC drama following the le of a policeman in rural Scotland.Filmed in Plockton, it ran to three series and proved an unlikely hit. Lunn wasnrsquot the only one involved who moved on to bigger and better things. Robert Carlyle had the title role andyou scan through the credits yoursquoll also find Shirley Henderson and Alastair Mackenzie as well as Skins creator Bryan Elsley and Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle, in a rare writing role.Today, Lunn isnrsquot the only working composer with the Midas touch. But since that first major commission his CV has been peppered with landmark productions, many of them period pieces. There was The White Queen, nominated for a Golden Globe in . There was Bleak House, nominated for  Emmy Awards and winner of the Best Drama Serial award at the  BAFTAs. There was Burton And Taylor, which starred Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter as the starring battling couple and which picked up a clutch of award nominations on both sides of the Atlantic. There have been many others.With his own Emmy wins and the higher profile they brought, Lunn would have been well placed to make the move to the US. Was he ever tempted  He had plenty offers, he says, but he turned them down.ldquoIt was a dficult period for me to have gone over to America because both my kids were in secondary school and they were quite happy where they were. I was getting plenty of work here and anyway six months of the year was taken up doing Downton.It hasnrsquot proved to be a mistake. Among Lunnrsquos recent compositions are the soundtracks for BBC Scotlandrsquos police series Shetland Sky Onersquos historical drama Jamestown, set in  in the American colony of the same name and, for Netflix, The Last Kingdom, an adaptation of Bernard Cornwellrsquos Saxon Stories, set in England in the Dark Ages.Hersquos particularly proud of the last one, a collaboration with genre-spanning Faroese singer Eivoslashr Paacutelsdoacutettir, also known for her work with composer Gavin Bryars.ldquoI think what wersquove done for The Last Kingdom is possibly about the most original thing Irsquove done, he says. A long way from the Downton Abbey soundtrack, which he describes as being ldquolike a combination of Coldplay and Philip Glass, it relies almost entirely on his studiorsquos battery of analogue synthesisers, though there is one other element: for the first time, he has found a use for that gong.Downton Abbey: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is out now Best trait  Irsquom fairly calm, even in a crisis.Worst trait  Yoursquod have to ask my we, but possibly some level of hypocrisy!Last book read  The Road To Wigan Pier by George OrwellLast film watched  Irsquove just finished Chernobyl and I thought it was brilliant.Whorsquos in your fantasy rock group and what do you play  Itrsquos not exactly rock but Irsquod have loved to have been Miles Davisrsquos bass player between  and  playing alongside the likes of Keith Jarrett, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, Herbie Hancock, John McLaughlin etc.Best advice received  Study at Glasgow University, given to me by my head of music at Stirling High School, Mr. Melville.Ideal dinner party guests  Nicola Sturgeon, Billy Connolly and Brian Eno"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Traitor  Liar  The Commons is becoming more like Twitter than Twitter","story":"Some pundits were saying that this unrestrained, aggressive style of political debate began with the  Scottish referendum. But the Indyref was never like this. There may have been a deal of bad language and anger on the fringes of the internet, where Yoons and Cybernats clashed by night, but never in parliament.The Commons went slightly mad last week, with hysterical finger pointing, tears and shouting. It was like a class of unruly school-kids in the middle of a sugar rush. Please miss: he called me a liar. No, I didnt. Yes, you did. Well, you started it by calling me a traitor. Miss! Miss! Only there was no one able to control this rowdy collection of over-wrought political egos, least of all the Speaker.So, who did start it  Well, Boris Johnson by deploying his rebarbative, war-time rhetoric. Calling the Benn Act the ldquoSurrender Act. Accusing MPs of being ldquotraitors, ldquobetraying the people. It was demeaning, even for him. But Im not going to apportion blame exclusively to the Prime Minister. Everyone has lost the plot over Brexit ndash not least Labour MPs, who repeatedly accuse Johnson of being a ldquoracistand a ldquotin pot dictator staging a ldquocoup.Why did the Labour MP Paula Sherrf think it wise to invoke the murdered MP, Jo Cox, in this cauldron of bile  It was a crude attempt to link Boris Johnsons ldquosurrender rhetoric, the far right, and a racist murder, ashe were somehow morally responsible. Johnson didnt help by responding that the ldquobest way to honour Jo Cox would be to get Brexit done. That was patently absurd, tasteless and inappropriate.But the reaction was even more hysterical. Youd have thought hed actually called for more MPs to be murdered. The Labour MP Jess Phillips accosted the Prime Minister in the lobby, demanding that he apologise for saying it was \"humbug to claim that his use of ldquoSurrender Act was an incitement to violence. Really  Apologise for using the word ldquohumbug This is how stupid, tangential rows erupt on social media ndash where everyone you disagree with becomes a fascist, and people get drunk on synthetic outrage. They all need to get a grip dial down the rhetoric stop playing to the Twitter gallery.Im tempted to suggest calling Lady Hale, the Spider Woman, along to sort this mess out. The -year-old president of the Supreme Court became an unlikely superhero last week after she unprorogued parliament and ruled that the PM had acted unlawfully. But shes a judge, who lives in the rarefied atmosphere of the Inns of Court, not the Commons bear pit.We dont yet know the full implications of last weeks Supreme Court ruling, except that they will profound. It amounted to, as the former Supreme Court judge, Lord Sumption, put it: ldquoa revolution. This is because the court ruled on whether the government had acted with ldquoreasonable justication in suspending parliament for five weeks. It may sound odd, but no one has expected governments to behave reasonably before.The English High Court had earlier ruled that the courts had no right to get involved in policy, and that was what most people believed. Butjudges are going to get involved in detailed political decision-making, then the Supreme Court will itself become politicised. It already is. There are calls for its judges to be subject to political vetting, as in America.Labour MPs and supporters were jubilant after Lady Hales ruling. But they may not be celebrating when Labour are next in government. They may find courts questioning policies like nationalisation and the abolition of private schools. Radical parties of the Left generally have more to fear from judicial activism than Conservatives. As do nationalists. Look at Catalonia, where politicians really are in jail because the Spanish supreme court ruled an independence referendum illegal. Couldnt happen here  Im beginning to wonder.But thats all for the future. The immediate problem is how this wretched Brexit crisis is to be resolved before real warfare breaks out. We should be thankful, perhaps, that the only punches thrown so far have been verbal ones. We havent yet had any Gilet Jaunes-style civil disobedience and rioting. But the country is on a kne edge and it is the duty of parliament to deal with this crisis, not become part of it.The Prime Minister has a majority of minus , has behaved unlawfully, and is refusing to honour the Benn Act, which requires him to ask for a third extension of Article . Former PM John Major has warned that Mr Johnson might resort to jiggery pokery in the Privy Council to overturn the Benn Act. He is anyway refusing to sign what he calls the ldquosurrender letter to Brussels.The rebel alliance, led by the brilliant SNP MP Joanna Cherry QChave their own solution. Cherry has filed a legal challenge under what is called ldquoNobile Officium ndash a legal device that allows the Court of Session in Edinburgh to sign and send the letter to Brussels on the Prime Ministers behalf.Theres nothing like it in English law. So why would a Scottish court interfere  Well, as it happens, rulings of Scottish courts apply across the entire UK, as a consequence of the Act of Union. The Government could appeal, of course, and the matter could end up back in the Supreme Court. Lady Hale is no doubt sharpening her quill pen as we speak.Nobile Officium is ingenious, but it would surely be all Dominic Cum-mings Christmases coming at once. The idea of Scottish judges signing away British sovereignty, as he might put it, and reversing the Brexit referendum, as he would also put it, would be an ideal curtain-raiser for a General Election. The people versus the Establishment.It would also get Boris Johnson off the hook of having to actually sign the ldquosurrender missive. Instead, he might just make clear to the European Union, that he will not cooperate. He will not appoint a British EU Commissioner, will not discuss the financial implications, will empty-chair summits. Parliament can force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension, but it cant force him to do so in good faith.MPs have one obvious solution: which is to get rid of him by a vote of No Confidence. Put this zombie administration out of its misery. This wouldnt mean that Boris gets to call his early General Election, as many people seem to believe. The Commons has  days to chose a caretaker administration, and negotiate the extension themselves. But MPs cant seem to agree even on this.It is partly because the parties are hopelessly ided over Brexit ndash having voted against Mays deal, a referendum, or revoking A, the lot. But they must take back control,they want to be sure of avoiding a No Deal Brexit. Judges cant do it. Parliament cant do it. Only a government can conduct negotiations with foreign powers. MPs have the power to replace Boris Johnson tomorrow.

Irsquom really glad that Irsquove managed to face it down successfully. I am extremely popular with the membership, and I think some people donrsquot like that very much.Asked about her leadership ambitions, Ms Cherry, who was first elected in , said any talk of her plotting to oust Ms Sturgeon was ldquoridiculous, especially as she was an MP and the leader must be an MSP.However she went on: ldquoThere is no vacancy. But Irsquom not ruling myself out as a potential future leadership figure. Itrsquos not something I would rule our or rule in at this stage.

It is dficult to see why. A time limit on the interview might have been part of the deal with Downing Street, but the beauty of a live programme is that things can changeneed be. Marrs interview with Boris Johnson was just reaching a critical juncture when the show segued to a pre-recorded interview with Dame Helen Mirren about Catherine the Great .Granted, viewers might have been looking forward to hearing from Dame Helen, but the segment could have been included in a longer version of the programme placed on iPlayer. Yes, the PMrsquos minders would likely have moanedthe interview overran, and it is not quite cricket to go back on an arrangement, yet as we are being constantly told, we are living in extraordinary times.As for the interview with Angela Rayner, Shadow Education Secretary, it could be justied by way of reaction to the Johnson interview. Couple of questions, job done. But we had her response, plus a rehash of last weekrsquos Labour conference story about public schools in England, and yet more speculation on what might happen next on Brexit.Was this a case of the BBC playing it safe when a commercial broadcaster might have gone for it with the Johnson interview and had the arguments later : PM says he acted with proprietyJust as these are unusual times, so Mr Johnson is an exceptional interviewee. That was made plain once more during his encounter with Marr. It was asthe BBC man was equipped with a water pistol, delivering questions in short, sharp, well-aimed bursts, and Mr Johnson was countering with one of those water cannons he bought as London Mayor and was banned from using by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. ldquoWhoosh! went a torrent of metaphor and hyperbole in Marrrsquos direction.It is a dficult style to combat. Interviewing Mr Johnson on the Today programme, Mishal Husain resorted to telling him to ldquoPlease stop talking, which he laughed at and carried on. Eddie Mair managed to get further than most by being icily forensic and not allowing himself to be distracted by the Johnson bluster. Marr did a heroic job of hauling the PM back to the topic on the many occasions he tried to break free, but even this was not enough to halt the tide of verbosity.The most newsworthy moment came towards the end of the encounter when talk turned to Mr Johnsonrsquos friendship with American businesswoman, Jenner Arcuri. The subject had been raised during the paper review. ldquoA lot of people are wonderingwe are going to talk about the Jenner Arcuri affair, said Marr during the item. ldquoYes, we are. They had to, given it was the splash in the Sunday Times. Plus, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had criticised the show for not tackling a Minister about the story last week, when it broke.: Facing court again over extensionThis time, Marr asked several times whether Mr Johnson, as London mayor, had declared any links to Ms Arcuri given her business was in receipt of public money and she had gone on publicly funded trade missions. ldquoThere was no interest to declare, said the PM.Over on Ridge on Sunday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, adopted a similar, nothing to see here, approach to the Arcuri story, saying that everything went through the proper processes.Next up was Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose party had taken out a double page ad in a Sunday newspaper proposing an electoral pact with the Conservatives as a way to give Mr Johnson ldquoa big, workable majority. The PM later brushed aside the offer.Host Sophy Ridge tackled Mr Farage on a recent speech in which he said ldquowersquoll take the kne to overpaid pen pushers in Whitehall who had tried to frustrate Brexit. ldquoIt would have been better to say axe, he conceded, claiming such language was are more in keeping with political tradition.If Mr Farage was now the vocabulary police to Mr Hancockrsquos traffic cop, it has hard to know what role Jackson Carlaw was playing on Sunday Politics Scotland. In the face of questioning by host Gordon Brewer, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives was like the office temp who had unwisely picked up a ringing phone as he was passing. No, he had not been consulted by London over new EU proposals. Nor was he going to be drawn on whether the PM would have to resignhe did not obey the law and seek a Brexit extension, as one of his own MSPs, Adam Tomkins, insisted earlier this month. Nothing had anything to do with Mr Carlaw, but he would take a message and make sure the right person received it once they ed from lunch.: Hospital building programme highlightedAt least he did not add more intemperate words and heat to what had been a torrid week.

The forward-thinking firms and entrepreneurs which Zero Waste Scotland is working with are already pioneering the circular economy ndash keeping goods and materials in a useful loop for as long as possible through reuse, remanufacture, repair and finally recycling to maximise the value of our limited resources.These pioneers are providing and developing a erse range of everyday products in innovative new sustainable ways, from lighting and computers to beds and beer.Tomorrow hundreds of leaders in business, policy and the public sector will join Zero Waste Scotland at the Scottish Resources Conferenceto celebrate and learn from these early adaptors. That second part is vital. Because we cannot create the truly circular national economy we so urgently need unless every single business and organisation follows suit, and does so fast. No matter how excellent their ideas and progress, the pioneers we work with cannot do this alone.Our huge consumption habit consistently causes the vast majority of the carbon emissions behind the climate emergency ndash so we need a national sht in behaviour. The traditional, linear system of making, using and binning products with little thought for the consequences has always been wasteful. And now the rise of fast food and more recently fast fashion is making that waste even worse.Millions of people now see the harm wreaked by our culture of convenience on endless news reports and documentaries on television such as the BBCrsquos recent War on Plastic.I doubt that legendary Scot John Logie Baird ever envisioned that the TV he invented would broadcast such shocking scenes.But Scottish wildle cameraman and photographer Doug Allan knows all too well the effect we, as people, are having on the planet. His award-winning work for BBC series such as Blue Planet has shown people how incredible our world is, and how blighted it is by climate change and plastic pollution. His powerful images have helped to fuel the public appetite for change which we have seen in the growing climate strike protests here and overseas.This week he will give a keynote speech at the SRC. Making that link between what we make, buy and often waste, the problems that causes and the solution which the circular economy presents is key. If consumers and companies join forces to change how they shop and work they can make a real, lasting dference. And not just in reducing the carbon emissions from all that waste. Becoming more sustainable will also help tackle a host of serious, related environmental issues from pollution to species loss.Over the next five years we are ramping up our work to help more businesses and the public sector find the best way to become more sustainable. What works for one firm or industry may not work for another. Revolutionising the way we design, produce and use everyday items involves complex challenges which will not be overcome overnight. Which is all the more reason why we need to close the loop sooner by transitioning to a nationwide circular economy much faster than we are currently. We wonrsquot meet the Scottish Government target for net zero carbon emissions by we move too slowly. We need to reach a tipping point within the next five years, so there is no time to waste.We have already shown that nationwide change is possible, however. Scotlandrsquos plastic bag charge reduced use of disposable carriers by  per cent within a year. Scotlandrsquos new depositscheme, urging shoppers to recycle their empty drinks bottles and cans to get their deposit back, promises to be equally successful.We have played a lead role in both schemes, which take advantage of peoplersquos natural inclination to avoid cost where that cost is made clear.Tomorrow we will publish a report suggesting that the same behaviour can be harnessed to dramatically reduce the millions of unnecessary, disposable cups which Scots use each year. That will help to inform valuable debate at the SRC as the Scottish Government considers the best way to address single use items. In just over  months Scotland will host the th United Nations climate change summit, the Conference of the Parties .That landmark event will bring world leaders here to agree the further action needed to combat the climate emergency.

It would have cost him very little to say sorry to Paula Sherrf, to say that he made a mistake, to say that he adopted the wrong tone in that answer. That he chose not to has made us all a little poorer.However I must say - and I say this in particular to my fellow Remainers - you are throwing stone after stone after stone through the windows of your glass houses. For your charge sheet is also long as extensive as that of your Leave opponents.Because for every Leave MP we find speaking at a rally calling Remainers traitors, we have David Lammy MP comparing the Conservative European Research Group to Hitler, a man who killed six million Jews. And for every Leave MP we have calling Hilary Bennrsquos Brexit-delaying legislation the Surrender Act, we have Ed Davey MP calling Boris Johnson a dictator, which in the lexicon of most normal people would place him in a bracket with Stalin, Pol Pot, Mugabe or Castro. And for every Brexit-supporting newspaper calling Remain MPs saboteurs, we have Remain-supporting newspapers accusing the Government of a coup, which we are presumably to believe is on par with the Sudanese Armyrsquos removal of Omar al-Bashir earlier this year.Can we see ourselves  Can we see how emaciating this is  Can David Lammy see that, unlike Hitler, MPs in the ERG are not genocidal  Can Ed Davey see that, unlike Hugo Chavez, Boris Johnson is not jailing journalists and choosing his own political opponents  If they cannot, then they belong in a dark corner of the internet, not in our Parliament.This propensity to lose all ability to be reasonable and rational is infecting more of my fellow Remainers than I had thought possible. I have always enjoyed watching Jess Phillips on television. Shersquos so raw, so real, so relevant in todayrsquos politics. But last week, referring to the \"humbug\" remark of which I wrote earlier, Phillips said very directly that Johnson referred to Jo Coxrsquos murder as humbug. He did not this was a quite deliberate and improper insinuation, ironically during Phillipsrsquo own Urgent Question about the consequences of language in politics. Again, I watched this exchange live, and felt myself deflating. Phillips instantly went from being part of the solution to being part of the problem.The Speaker, John Bercow, was reasonable and even-handed in his remarks last week, when he said that fault lay on both sides. He was right. But the trouble with many of my fellow Remainers is that they simply donrsquot agree. They carry with them a moral superiority which guides them into the unshakeable belief that we are right and they are wrong. That itrsquos okay for us to call Johnson a dictator but itrsquos not okay for him to accuse us of betrayal, because wersquore the good guys and hersquos the bad guy. The ultimate irony is that, in the final analysis, this moral superiority played a key role in the disconnection between the political classes and the people, and the subsequent loss of the  referendum.We now must hit the reset button. In my view, this is more about the deliberate attribution of inaccurate thoughts or actions to opponents than it is about language itself. The language itself is primarily spin. For instance, claiming that the Benn Act is a \"surrender\" is deliberately emotive, but little dferent to claiming that a \"hard\" Brexit is a \"clf edge\", also deliberately emotive terms designed to make you think the other option must be better.Instead, at least as a first step, I would like to see the deliberate and  attribution cease. When Boris Johnson claims that everyone who fails to support leaving the EU come-what-may on st October all want to Remain, that is as deliberate and  an attribution to them as Jess Phillipsrsquo \"humbug\" attribution is to him.Neither side can pat themselves on the back today. Neither side should be going to bed sleeping soundly in the belief that they can hold their heads high. I could count on my hands the number of MPs who I could honestly say have the right to do that.It sounds hard even unachievable. But it really is not. All they have to do is act normally.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

Large operators First Aberdeen and Stagecoach were joined by six local bus firms launching the new “Grasshopper” Day and Weekly tickets in Inverurie, which became available on Friday . The new tickets allow unlimited travel on any local bus service throughout the Aberdeen city and shire commuter belt. The Grasshopper ticket means bus customers no longer need purchase separate tickets for dferent operators. For example, a commuter travelling from Inverurie to Altens in Aberdeen would have required separate tickets to access Stagecoach and First services. Customers will instead be able to purchase one Grasshopper ticket, saving around  per cent on the cost of a ticket.It is hoped that the convenience of the new Day and Weekly tickets will tempt commuters out of their cars and help to ease congestion and reduce carbon emissions.Aberdeenshire Council, Aberdeen City Council and Nestrans recognise the role of ticketing in making public transport more attractive. The joint Fares and Ticketing Strategy for the North East includes an action to work with operators to encourage joint ticketing arrangements and Aberdeenshire Council has played a major role in facilitating the introduction of the new ticket.Grasshopper tickets are available for purchase on board services operated by First Aberdeen, Stagecoach, Bains Coaches, JM Burns, Central Taxis , Kineil Coaches, MW Nicoll Hirersand Watermill Coaches.Day tickets cost £. and Weekly Tickets £.Within Aberdeenshire the Day and Weekly tickets are available on all buses serving the commuter belt around Aberdeen. That includes Banchory, Dunecht, Echt, Ellon, Inverurie, Kemnay, Kintore, Newburgh, Newmachar, Newtonhill, Oldmeldrum, Stonehaven, Tarves and intermediate areas.Passengers should look out for the Grasshopper logo on posters or ask their driver for further information.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Many people simply don’t know how to respect wild country. Some of the ways to minimise your impact aren’t obvious and even experienced walkers can do unthinking harm. In Scotland, little advice is given on how to walk and camp softly in the hills, leaving no trace of your visit.“Even in the wildest areas of Scotland it’s not unusual to find bags of rubbish left in bothies, water sources contaminated by human waste and litter crammed into the crevices of cairns and stone walls.“Another problem we face in these days of over-tourism is the damage we do without realising it. On a typical Bank Holiday on Ben Nevis people make their way up to the summit in an almost continuous line.: ‘A weekend haven’ - Homeless village hailed as one of Scotland’s most attractive places to stay “The problem is numbers. The paths on our mountains were never created for such a volume of traffic so damage has become inevitable. The Munros are so popular that many of the paths have become eroded scars and some wild camping spots are over-used and left worn and shabby.“Yet the majority of folk who walk and camp in the hills of Scotland do so because they love it.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"jackie bird won t be on tv so cancel hogmanay aidan smith","story":"What does the future hold for the BBC#s annual festive shindig wonders a worried Aidan SmithWe develop such a special relationship with our favourite presenters on the goggle-box and the old steam radio that during broadcasts it’s like they’re speaking only to us in a cosily intimate tete-a-tete.

Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"thomas cook customers face two month wait for refunds","story":"Direct debit customers will be refunded within  days, but others will have to wait up to  days, according to the Civil Aviation Authority .A new online refund system will be launched by the regulator on  October.: ATOL claim: How to get a CAA refund for your Thomas Cook holidayCustomers looking to get back funds lost due to cancelled flights or holidays linked to the collapse of Thomas Cook will have to fill out an electronic refund form.The CAAis having to refund , customers.The pool is three times larger than any previous refund programme.A statement from the authority said: \"We hope to pay refunds within  days of receiving a valid refund form.\"More information will be available on our website from  October.\"A total of , Thomas Cook customers paid for their future holiday by direct debit.The remaining , paid through other means and are the ones facing up to a two-month wait to get their money back.In previous cases where a holiday firm has collapsed the refund process has typically taken from  to  days.However, the elevated risk of fraud and the high number of customers involved has delayed the refund process when it applies to Thomas Cook: Barrhead Travel opens up  jobs for former Thomas Cook staffThe CAA has meanwhile brought home more than two thirds of the people who were on holiday when the travel firm collapsed on Monday last week.There are still more than , people on holiday abroad who are due tohome on or before  October.: Big-hearted Scottish woman sparks £ whip round for Thomas Cook crew on board flightRichard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA, said: \"The scale and complexity of this operation will inevitably cause some inconvenience and disruption and I would like to thank holidaymakers for bearing with us.\"Peter Fankhauser, the former boss of Thomas Cook, has said he is \"deeply sorry\" over the historic travel firms liquidation.The -year-old travel firm collapsed last week, putting , staff in the UK out of work.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us. To provide this type of sports provision for the children, for the community.“It is important to stress that we want the community to be part of the management process of this project and we have extended several invitations for residents to join the Glassmullin Management Committee. The vision has always been co-ownership of this project and that remains as such.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from educating rita to shirley valentine","story":", words of script could seem daunting to many a seasoned actor but West Belfast actress Tara Lynne O’Neill is sharing each and every one with pathos, poignancy and hilarity as she continues her storming Shirley Valentine at the Lyric Theatre.The Derry Girls actress was approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part she had no hesitation in accepting.“It was a play I’ve always wanted to do. I did Educating Rita at the Lyric and it felt right to perform Shirley here as well.“I was waiting to get to that right age in my career and we went into rehearsals in May. There is something about Willy Russell’s work that relates to me and to Belfast I think the humour translates exactly the same. Both Rita and Shirley have similarities, they are characters who want more,” she said.The Fall and In The Line of Duty actress said the play still has resonance today despite being written more than  years ago.“For many generations women have been told their place. Here is a woman that says ‘well this is what I want and I want to do it dferently’.”Tara spoke of how she “couldn’t wait” to work with acclaimed Tinderbox Artistic Director Patrick J O’Reilly on the production.“I knew he would bring such physicality to the piece, I never wanted it to be me playing lots of dferent people, it has to be Shirley. Patrick’s take on plays is always a little bit to the left so I couldn’t wait to see how left he would go and boy did he go left,” she laughed.“Right from the off Patrick and set and lighting designer Paul Keogan wanted the set to symbolise many things. It opens in Shirley’s kitchen, it’s stark, it’s white, it’s almost asylum like. Shirley keeps it so clean so the symbolism of her writing ‘Greece’ in huge colourful letters on a pristine white kitchen is a really beautul concept that Patrick and Paul came up with.”She continued: “When Act Two opens and Shirley is in Greece, she hasn’t completely left her le behind, she’s only gone to Greece for a fortnight. Her surroundings have changed but there are remnants of her le back home still on the stage. Because you change scene doesn’t mean you have changed, that change has to come from you and I loved that premise.“At the end of the show, her husband Joe is coming over to see her and she is excited by that. Willy Russell doesn’t knowthey are getting back together but they are meeting up. The character of Shirley doesn’t blame Joe for anything that has happened – or didn’t happen in her le. They were both these hopeful people when they married and somewhere along the way le got in the way, everyone in a couple can relate to that.”The former St Genevieve’s High School student does not wear a mic during performances, which helps herbe “intimate with the whole theatre”.“The character of Shirley is a gt, I always knew she was and I think there’s a Shirley in everyone. People seem to instantly connect and understand her and that make it really lovely because then it’s just a conversation I’m having with  people a night. It’s a conversation about le, the script is poignant, it’s sad but ultimately uplting for everyone.”Shirley Valentine runs at The Lyric Theatre until October .

Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":null,"title":"dup would look at a brexit backstop if it was timelimited says foster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Foster also confirmed that the DUP will back Boris Johnson in any confidence vote amid speculation that one could be called in the coming days.There was standing room only as Mrs Foster told a Policy Exchange fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester: \"In terms of the time-limited backstop, can I remind you whatLeo Varadkar thinks of the time-limited backstop - he says it is not a backstop at all. \"And so in terms of the time-limited backstop, we have said in the past it is something we would look at. I dont think it is something that Leo Varadkar would look at, but certainlya time-limited backstop was on offer it is something that we would look at but I dont believe it is at this present moment in time.\" She described the backstop proposal as \"anti-democratic\", but said she believed a \"way forward\" existed, claiming it was possible to find a deal \"even at this late stage\". \"I firmly believe that there is a way forward, thatthe European Union and the Republic of Ireland Government in particular care about protecting the Belfast Agreement as they say they are, then they need to acknowledge that the backstop will not do it for Northern Ireland, or indeed the rest of the United Kingdom, and therefore we need to find a new way forward,\" she said. Mrs Foster - whose party props up the Prime Ministers minority government - later added: \"I think even at this late stage we can find a deal that is acceptable to the House of Commons and is acceptable to Europe.\" However, she remained adamant that Northern Ireland had to \"leave on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom\" in relation to customs arrangements. She said that \"we cannot have internal customs borders within the United Kingdom\", because \"from a constitutional point of view and from an economic point of view [they] do not work internally within the United Kingdom\".\"Actually, when you think of the amount of trade we do east-west and west-east, it completely blows out of the water the north-south trade. Im not saying the north-south trade is not important - it is of course important - but our east-west trade is much more important.\"The DUP leader also told her audience she could not accept regulatory checks between Britain and Northern Ireland that went beyond agri-food.\"You have to understand that the whole raison detre of the DUP is the Union, its the reason we get involved in politics, its the reason that we stay involved in politics despite all the challenges that come to us in Northern Ireland.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the

leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pump track wales uks largest split track opens rhayader","story":"Kirsty Williams AM tries her hand on one of the bicycles following the opening oltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtf the Wales Pump Traltspan classtruncate-full-screengtck together with some of the cycling enthusiasts present.

I hope that the Chief Constable will be able to ensure that local police commanders have the adequate resources made available so they can go after the terrorists.He added: ldquoThese republican criminals are attempting to hold our community to ransom and I would like to see a focused and properly resourced PSNI investigation into their activities to disrupt and take down their structures before they murder or seriously injure anyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch man admits selling southern Tayto in Northern Ireland  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man has admitted breaching the trademark of crisp manufacturing giant Tayto.At Belfast High Court last week, Mark Ferris admitted selling the same name brand crisps from the Republic in Northern Ireland and may be liable for damages.The sole trader claims he only made around pound profit from the sale of Tayto crisps manufactured in the Republic to shops and pubs north of the border, a judge was told.A lawyer for  year-old Ferris argued that the Northern Ireland company was ldquousing a very large sledgehammer to crack a very small nut in seeking a further hearing to examine any potential financial compensation.But counsel for the Tandragee-based firm insisted it was about protecting its trademark.According to Peter Hopkins action was only taken against Mr Ferris after he was sent four letters warning him to stop selling the southern brand.ldquoOne misconception is the impression given, to put it colloquially, that he was some innocent abroad, the barrister said. ldquoIt was a breach of the law, and two separate companies trading north and south.Tayto Northern Ireland issued trademark infringement proceedings against Mr Ferris, trading as Candy Plus, with the case relating to his alleged sale of Tayto crisps from the Republic at locations in Belfast and where.Mr Justice Huddleston was told Mr Ferris has operated a business from his home over the past three years, selling confectionery, snacks and drinks.His barrister, Kevin Morgan, confirmed that the breach was admitted, but stressed that no counterfeit goods were involved.ldquoThe southern Tayto were legally purchased by him in the Republic of Ireland, counsel maintained.Questioning why action was taken against his client, Mr Morgan argued that the same crisps are being sold throughout Northern Ireland.He described Mr Ferrisrsquo business as ldquominuscule when compared to Tayto Northern Ireland ldquoIn the last year he estimates that he earned pound, in profits. By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class. In ,  children attended the school.The writing on the wall came when a proposed merger with nearby Annsborough Integrated Primary School to create a controlled integrated school was abandoned in the face of falling pupil numbers.In May the Education Authority issued a document in which it stated that Castlewellan Primary would close and Annsborough Integrated would be retained.The document said numbers at Castlewellan Primary had declined ldquoto a point where the potential establishment of a controlled integrated primary school was no longer viable.The closure will mark the end of controlled education in the town. Castlewellan High School closed in  when it merged with Killyleagh and Quoile high schools to form Down Academy mdash now Blackwater integrated College mdash in Downpatrick.Mr McLean said staff would continue to give pupils ldquothe best possible education until the school closes its doors for the final time.ldquoI have been here for  years. It is disheartening when you put your heart into your job mdash as every teacher does mdash only for your school to be taken away, he remarked.ldquoWe are still a happy school, but it will be a very sad day for the school, the children, the staff, the parents and the community when it closes.All objections to the closure proposal should be made to the Department of Education, Rathgael House, Balloo Road, Bangor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick mum hosts charity singing competition in aid of ALPS  ","story":"THE mother of a Downpatrick man who sought help from a local mental health organisation during a low point in his le is hosting a local version of The Voice singing competition, starting this Saturday night.Joanne Flynn says she is organising a series of three heats and a grand final of the popular reality TV show at Fitzpatrickrsquos Bar in Church Street in aid of All Lives Are Precious .Joanne describes being amazed at the support her  year-old son, Michael, received from the non-profit community organisation when he was battling a bout of depression a few years ago.ALPS, which relies heavily on goodwill from volunteers and members of the public for its survival, offers support and services on emotional well-being, mental health education and suicide prevention.Joanne said: ldquoI am so grateful to ALPS. They acted fast and got him the help he needed.ldquoWe know too well that men in particular find it hard to talk about this kind of thing. Irsquom just glad my son did. I can never thank Ronan Gilchrist and the ALPS team enough. They are really a fantastic organisation.ldquoEven though Michael still battles with depression the counselling he got was effective. It helped him so much and we will always be very thankful to them.Joanne added: ldquoI want to thank all the local businesses who have donated to our raffle and to everyone who has contributed with their time and effort to help make each night a success.ldquoThe evenings also offer an opportunity for unsung local talent to shine.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision.

In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town.

Wins over Tullylish, Teconnaught and Ballymartin has propelled them into the last four.The only blot on their landscape was a defeat to Ballymartin, but they avenged that loss later in the competition. However, they have not faced any side as good as Darragh yet and Jody McGovern, Jack Haughey, Niall Rafferty, Conor Donnelly and Kevin Hegarty will have to be at their best and then somethey are to get the better of Darragh.Glenn, seen as many punditsrsquo favourites to win the competition, then take on St Johnrsquos in what promises to be another close encounter.Glenn may not have made the impact on Division  as they would have liked, but they have been impressive in championship outings against Liatroimand Saul, winning all three games in style.St Johnrsquos have been as equally impressive and wins over Annaclone, Drumgath and Teconnaught have taken them to the brink of a final.The Johnnies will again rely on the firepower of John Clarke, Marty Keenan, Danny and Chris McKay and Conor Morgan to get them over the line, but they must beware the attacking abilities of Mattie Bagnall, Denis Murtagh, Jarlath McConaghy, Jack McCartan and Patrick Brooks.The top clash of the weekend at Pairc Esler on Saturday night then takes centre stage with Clonduff out to ruinrsquos Kilcoorsquos double bid.Kilcoo, who are sitting pretty at the top of Division , look certain to regain their ACFL crown, but nothing less than winning the Frank OrsquoHare Cup will do a hungry Magpies camp.However, you have to admire Kilcoorsquos resilience and fortitude. The Branagan brothers just never know when they are beaten and when you have Conor Laverty buzzing on the edge of the square, anything can happen.Clonduffrsquos first priority will be to try and stop a supply line into Laverty and the OrsquoHagens, McConvilles and Carrs are in for a busy night of it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Sisters.jpg","title":"Sisters hosting night of music with Community Gospel Choir  ","story":"THE countdown is on to this Saturday eveningrsquos fundraising concert in Downpatrick in aid of Cancer Focus NI.Sisters Emma and Evie Telford are busy with the final preparations for the event in memory of their mum Lorna who passed away just over five years ago.The concert mdash which is being held at the Quoile Bar and Bistro at the Strangford Road in the town mdash starts at .pm.Emma and Evie have organised a number of fundraising events in memory of their mum to support Cancer Focus NI, a charity which was of great comfort and help to them in the run-up to their mumrsquos passing and after her death.A non-smoker, Mrs Telford died on September , , following a long battle with lung cancer.The Downpatrick sisters are keen to give something back to a charity which helped them, with the money they raise being used to support the Cancer Focus Family Support Service.Emma and Evie want to help other children and young people who will have to deal with the devastating news that their mum or dad is terminally ill.ldquoWe want to raise money for Cancer Focus because the charity means so much to us.

Shelves in a number of stores are already heaving with tree decorations, Santa paraphernalia, and Christmas cards. A Christmas display in TK MaxxTesco annoyed some shoppers by welcoming the festive season months ahead of Christmas Day.The supermarket chain is selling tubs of Celebrations, Cadbury Heroes and Quality Street in Christmassy packaging..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Shoppers have been greeted by towers of the tubsplaced near the entrance in a range of selected outlets. The deal has attracted thousands of likes, shares and comments online.But Tesco is certainly not alone.Poundland’s Belfast store has dedicated an aisle to Christmas stock, with baubles, Santa hats, stockings, comedy festive glasses, garlands and all manner of twinkly items. Ironically, the neighbouring aisle is jam-packed with scary masks, skeleton costumes and ghoulish decorations for Halloween.Similarly Card Land is in full-on festive mode with wrapping paper, cards and Christmas knick-knacks for sale alongside the usual birthday cards and calendars. Ann Dougan from Ballymena said she liked looking at the items, but felt it was way too early.‘‘It’s definitely too early. My son’s just gone back to school and I feel like the summer has just ended.’’Meanwhile, staff at TK Maxx in Belfast’s Donegall Arcade were setting up a display of miniature Christmas trees, silver deer ornaments and an array of jovial-looking Santas. Even some shop windows in the city centre have been given a seasonal styling. A group of ornamental carol singers in Victorian garb adorn the window of Guineys department store.Opportunity knocks for asylum seekers thanks to Presbyterian Church Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"And high street stalwartMarks and Spencer is offering three for two on Christmas cards and wrapping paper. But whilst the Christmas onslaught may seem ludicrously early, given that Halloween is still a month away, shops in Ulster are still lagging behind the mainland. London department store Selfridges opened its Christmas shop in July, proudly claiming it is again the first in the world to unveil its Christmas section, a “record”  days before the event itself and two days earlier than last year.But not everyone is happy with the early Christmas celebrations. Viewers of the popular TV show This Morning were outraged this week by a Christmas segment.There were Christmas trees, baubles and snow on the screens in the studio – and even presenter Phillip Schofield was gobsmacked.But co-host Holly Willoughby, who was loving the festivities, said: “You know what it doesn’t feel wrong.”Shaking his head with horror, open-mouthed Phil replied: “It does.”This Morning viewers took to Twitter to voice their displeasure at the Christmas segment. One viewer joked: “How long have I been asleep for, swear I went to bed in September  However, there was one person that sided with Holly, who tweeted: “I’m with @hollywills on this one! I can’t wait for Christmas.’’try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when asked how he felt about the firm going into administrationHeartbreaking tributes paid to young N.I. woman who

For now, Mehdi – her brother-in-law – acts as her interpreter. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Two days after she arrived in Northern Ireland Jamileh was welcomed into the Presbyterian Church.She said: “My husband Samad and I had a lot of trouble because of the persecution in our country. Project leader Keith Preston, PCI Moderator Dr William Henry, volunteer Jamileh Salehzadeh, moderator of the North Belfast Presbytery Rev Colin Gamble and Council for Mission in Ireland secretary David Bruce at the official opening of the Op Shop“I am seeing peace between people and friendly people in Northern Ireland.”Mehdi told his story: “It wasn’t my choice to leave. I came here because I was an asylum seeker. I fled my country because of persecution of Christianity in my country. My brother stayed and I lost him because of persecution for our beliefs.“When I left I gave my hand to God’s hand. I said ‘help me’ and He brought me to here.”“I came here with my daughter and my we. My other son was born in Northern Ireland in .“I’ve have been made very welcome by the church. In  I became an elder with the church.”The Presbyterian Church in Ireland’s ongoing work to meet the practical and spiritual needs of the people of the city of Belfast, took a fresh turn last week with the official opening its Opportunity Shop or ‘Op Shop’ – a new charity shop initiative to help and support local and migrant families in north Belfast.Jamileh is one of the volunteers at the charity shop at Carlisle Circus specialising in quality nearly new children and baby clothes, and other essential items that families need, from high chairs and cuddly toys to changing mats and packs of nappies., Sir Knight Cal Stephens , Sovereign Grand Master Rev William Anderson, Sir Knight Ronald Horneand Assistant Sovereign Grand Master William Ballie at the th International Lecturers Conference in Manchester\"  , Sir Knight Cal Stephens , Sovereign Grand Master Rev William Anderson, Sir Knight Ronald Horneand Assistant Sovereign Grand Master William Ballie at the th International Lecturers Conference in Manchester\"  Chapter Chat: High standard on display at Royal Black lecturers’ conference Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Op Shop is part of the local church’s response to the number of families who have made their homes in the north of the city from overseas.The project is the first phase of a joint initiative by PCI’s North Belfast Presbytery and the denomination’s Council for Mission in Ireland to support migrant families in the local area. Ten congregations are providing volunteers, including five volunteers who have come to live in the city from Africa and the Middle East. Trevor Long, Clerk of the Presbytery, said that a weekly Parents and Toddlers meeting and English classes will follow in November. Longer-term, a drop in centre called the International Meeting Point , will open in the former church hall behind the new shop.He said: “After years of welcoming migrants and asylum seekers to PCI’s International Meeting Point in south Belfast, we were aware that many who went to the IMP were from north Belfast, had young families, and had to crisscross the city involving a four bus journey round trip. “There was a need to do something locally. The Opportunity Shop, is the first part of a process that will see the setting up of a second International Meeting Point in the city.”“This project has reinvigorated our local congregations and I am glad to say that the shop is already being used by members of the wider local community. This initiative is an opportunity to help, an opportunity to offer friendship and an opportunity for people to get a bargain in the process. “It is wonderful to be able to demonstrate a living Christian witness of practical love and care, particular on this site, which was once home to one our biggest churches.”Presbyterian Moderator, Right Rev Dr William Henry, joined volunteers to help officially open the new venture. He said: “The Op Shop is part of a long tradition and rich heritage of the Church’s direct involvement in the welfare of the city and its people.“Alongside loving and supporting others, the Bible commends hospitality as a basic Christian response to the outworking of our faith.“One hundred and fty years ago Presbyterian’s committed to supporting the practical and spiritual needs of the whole person in the city through the Shankill Road Mission.“That tradition remains alive and well today through a range of services and initiatives run by the Church centrally, and by presbyteries, which includes the International Meeting Point in south Belfast. “The Opportunity Shop is the latest example of reaching out with the love of Christ to the local community and beyond.”International Meeting Point project leader Keith Preston said: “This is very much an opportunity for the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to be back here in Carlisle Circus. “We’ve been here from  but unfortunately just for the past few years our church has been retreating up the Antrim Road. “This is an opportunity in a very strategic interface area where we have international people, people from the nationalist and loyalist community, and we are getting those people in the shop mixing together.“It’s a great opportunity for Presbyterians to work together and to reach out with the good news of the Gospel.“It also is a good news story. I got a phonecall from Limavady to say they had some baby clothes for the shop. How did they hear about it  People need help and churches want to help.“The first phase is the shop, we have this hall to be used starting November to have a parent and toddler group. We’ll start English classes. “Very shortly after that I will open it one day a week as a drop in that same way as south Belfast.”It is hoped the Presbyterian Church in Ireland can open a second location to meet the practical and spiritual needs of migrants and asylum seekers in the city of Belfast.The International Meeting Point in south Belfast was opened in . Keith said that the church’s aim was to create the same kind of support in the north of the city.He commented: “The IMP really does do what it says on the tin, it’s a safe place for people from dferent nations to meet. “As a team we serve out of compassion and as agents of welcome to those who, for whatever reason, find themselves far away from home.“We are looking forward to getting IMP up and running, as it will be an important addition to our mission as a church, especially to those who are really on the periphery of society,” he said.“The Op Shop is a first for us. Having opened in August we have welcomed people from overseas, local people from both traditions in the city as well, so it is not only an international, but a multi-cultural initiative, and we hope that it will be a blessing to many people.”The Presbytery of North Belfast stretches from the Shankill Road across Ballysillan to New Mossley and Glengormley to Rathcoole, heading back down the Shore Road to Whiteabbey and Sinclair Seamen’s Presbyterian Church in the docks. There are approximately , people across the north of the city who have a connection with its  Presbyterian congregations. With the area becoming home to more and more migrant families the church is often their first port of call.Council for Mission in Ireland secretary David Bruce: “People who have suffered persecution often come from countries where they might not necessarily feel confident in going to the authorities, and therefore won’t go to the authorities in a new country.“They come to the church. In turn we try to show them the police in Northern Ireland are dferent. We bring communities officers into the church to speak to them.”He said: “There is a wide iety of programmes we offer in support of migrants. There’s a iety of strands of care.”try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when asked how he felt about the firm going into administrationHeartbreaking tributes paid to young N.I.

yesterday said her party would #look at# a time-limited backstop # as she insisted there remained a chance of finding a Brexit deal before October .The proposal would put a deadline on the backstop arrangement required by the European Union to avoid a hard border in Ireland — but it has previously been rejected by the Irish government.Mrs Foster told a Policy Exchange fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.“In terms of the time-limited backstop, can I remind you what Leo Varadkar thinks of the time-limited backstop — he says it is not a backstop at all..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget

have said in the past it is something we would look at.“I don’t think it is something that Leo Varadkar would look at, but certainlya time-limited backstop was on offer it is something that we would look at but I don’t believe it is at this present moment in time.”She described the backstop proposal as “anti-democratic”, but said she believed a “way forward” existed — claiming it was possible to find a deal “even at this late stage”.“I firmly believe that there is a way forward, thatthe European Union and the Republic of Ireland government in particular care about protecting the Belfast Agreement as they say they are, then they need to acknowledge that the backstop will not do it for Northern Ireland or indeed the rest of the United Kingdom and therefore we need to find a new way forward.”Mrs Foster, whose party props-up Boris Johnson’s minority government, later added: “I think even at this late stage we can find a deal that is acceptable to the House of Commons and is acceptable to Europe.”However, she remained adamant that Northern Ireland had to “leave on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom” in relation to customs arrangements.“We cannot have internal customs borders within the United Kingdom... it has constitutional implications as well as economic implications.“Actually when you think of the amount of trade we do East-West and West-East it completely blows out of the water the North-South trade.“I’m not saying the North-South trade is not important — it is of course important — but our East-West trade is much more important.”Boris

He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march. He said: \"The massive turnout for the climate strike march in Cardf showed the strength of feeling from all sections of our community on the ongoing crisis and the impacts already being felt across the world.\"While people of all ages were present, this was a day when young voices were prominent with speaker after speaker articulating their generations anger at government inertia. This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland.

David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
