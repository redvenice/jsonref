Ben Ray Luján told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that he didn\u0027t like how non-users would have to sign up for a Facebook page in order to see what the social network had scooped up about them Luján took issue with the practice because non-users currently had to sign up for Facebook if they wanted to see what data of theirs the social network collected. \u0027You\u0027ve said everyone controls their data, by you\u0027re collecting data on people that are not even Facebook users who have never signed a consent, a privacy agreement,\u0027 Luján said, encouraging Zuckerberg to fix the problem. During the five-hour hearing, the Facebook CEO revealed that his own personal data had been included when 87 million or so Facebook users had their data improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  \u0027Yes,\u0027 he answered when asked by Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat, whether his data was included in the data sold to malicious third parties. \u0027Your personal data?\u0027 Eshoo clarified.  But he pushed back on  suggestions from the members of the House of Representatives that users do not have enough control of their data on Facebook in the wake of the privacy scandal at the world\u0027s largest social media network.\u0027Every time that someone chooses to share something on Facebook ... there is a control.

Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, brought along with him a vintage Dilbert cartoon to make a point about Facebook\u0027s \u0027terms and conditions.\u0027  \u0027I consulted my technology consultant Scott Adams, in the form of Dilbert,\u0027 Burgess said. The cartoon strip shows Dilbert telling Dogbert, \u0027I didn\u0027t read all of my shrink-wrap license agreement on my new software until after I opened it.

Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, deployed an interesting line of questioning, asking Zuckerberg about the origins of \u0027Facemash\u0027 and if it was still up and running. \u0027No, congressman. Facemash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,\u0027 Zuckerberg replied. \u0027There was a movie about this, it says it was about this, of unclear truth, and the claim that Facemash was somehow connected to the development of Facebook, it isn\u0027t, it wasn\u0027t,\u0027 the CEO continued, referencing the 2010 movie, \u0027The Social Network.\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that he created that website in 2003. \u0027It actually has nothing do to with Facebook,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you put up pictures of women and decide which one was the better, the more attractive of the two, is that right?\u0027 Long asked. Zuckerberg said that was right. \u0027Congressman, that is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was sophomore in college,\u0027 the CEO said, as Long made comments about the website\u0027s beginnings.           After asking about Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s \u0027Facemash\u0027 website, Rep. Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, brought up perceived bias against Trump-supporting sisters, Diamond and Silk          Rep. Billy Long even went as far as to have an aide hold up a picture of the two women and asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who they were. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 the 33-year-old CEO answered LAWMAKERS FIXATE ON DIAMOND AND SILK CONTROVERSYLong then asked staff to hold up a large photograph and asked Zuckerberg to describe who was pictured. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 Zuckerberg asked. Long said it was. \u0027That is Diamond and Silk, two biological sisters from North Carolina, I might point out they\u0027re African-American, and their content was deemed by your folks to be unsafe,\u0027 Long said. \u0027Diamond and Silk have a question for you. And that question is, What is unsafe about two black women supporting President Donald J. Trump?\u0027 he continued. A number of Republican lawmakers asked Zuckerberg questions about the Trump-supporting sisters over his two days of testimony on Capitol Hill. \u0027Well Congressman, nothing is unsafe about that,\u0027 Zuckerberg answered.  Facebook acknowledged sending a message to the sisters, prominent conservative video bloggers, deeming their content \u0027unsafe,\u0027 but the social network said the contents of the message were \u0027inaccurate.\u0027 \u0027We have communicated directly with Diamond And Silk about this issue. The message they received last week was inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicate with our community and the people who run Pages on our platform,\u0027 Facebook\u0027s spokeswoman Sarah Pollack said. In front of lawmakers, Zuckerberg was caught flat-footed, as the Diamond and Silk situation had developed over the past several days. \u0027The specifics of this situation I am not as up to speed on as I would be,\u0027 Zuckerberg told Long.   Other Republicans brought up the Diamond and Silk incident to ask the Facebook co-founder questions about political bias. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, deployed that line of questioning on Tuesday.  \u0027There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship,\u0027 Cruz said. \u0027There have been numerous instances with Facebook.\u0027  Rep. Joe Barton, another Texas Republican, held up his phone and told Zuckerberg he was going to ask him a question that someone had submitted to the congressman\u0027s Facebook account. \u0027First question: Please ask Mr. Zuckerberg, why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as Diamond and Silk? Facebook called them unsafe to the community. That is absurd. They hold conservative views. That isn\u0027t unsafe,\u0027 Barton said reading the question, and adding his own, \u0027What\u0027s your response?\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that his team had made \u0027an enforcement error.\u0027 \u0027And we\u0027ve already gotten in touch with them to reverse it,\u0027 he said, referring to Diamond and Silk. Later on in the hearing Wednesday, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican running for Senate, asked whether free speech is being censored by the site.Zuckerberg used the example of terrorism, as the types of posts that would be pulled from Facebook. \u0027Let me tell you right now, Diamond and Silk is not terrorism,\u0027 Blackburn scoffed.  WALL STREET INVESTORS LOVE ZUCK On Tuesday, Zuckerberg took questions for nearly five hours in a Senate hearing without making any further promises to support new legislation or change how the social network does business, foiling attempts by senators to pin him down. Investors were impressed with his initial performance. Shares in Facebook posted their biggest daily gain in nearly two years on Tuesday, closing up 4.5 percent. They were down 0.7 percent in early trading on Wednesday.On Wednesday Zuckerberg\u0027s testimony further bolstered investors\u0027 views of the company, with the CEO\u0027s performance leading them to believe that the company would weather the storm surrounding Cambridge Analytica.   Facebook has been consumed by turmoil for nearly a month, since it came to light that millions of users\u0027 personal information was wrongly harvested from the website by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted President Trump\u0027s election campaign among its clients.Zuckerberg faced broad concerns from members of Congress about how Facebook shares user data.

Ed Markey to endorse a proposed law that would require companies to get people\u0027s permission before sharing personal information, Zuckerberg agreed to further talks.\u0027In principle, I think that makes sense, and the details matter, and I look forward to having our team work with you on fleshing that out,\u0027 Zuckerberg said.But those qualms didn\u0027t rattle Wall Street as Zuckerberg testified that despite the #DeleteFacebook movement, the number of uses of the website hasn\u0027t gone down significantly.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/13/4B13BA0400000578-0-image-a-15_1523537162998.jpg","title":"Infant safe left baby box near Michigan City","story":"Lt.

Sources told the magazine that Barris is looking to go to Netflix, which recently signed former ABC powerhouse Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy to nine-figure contracts.It may be difficult for Barris to get out of his contract, since he just signed a four-year deal with the network last year.

Tornado jets at RAF Marham in Norfolk were prepared for a sortie this afternoon as ministers gathered in Downing Street            Air crews at the Norfolk base could be deployed to join RAF colleagues already based in Cyprus if the Government launches military action           One of the jets was pictured returning to the runway this afternoon after a flight in the skies over Britain           Fuel tanks for the Tornado jets were also visible being prepared on the airfield todayThe premier has been bolstered by Brexit Secretary David Davis.Despite voting against military action in Syria in 2013, when David Cameron wanted to respond to another chemical weapons outrage, Mr Davis hinted that he was ready to support it this time.Asked at a conference in London why he had previously opposed strikes, Mr Davis said: \u0027One was because he (Mr Cameron) hadn\u0027t provided the evidence and intelligence that we knew who it was, and secondly because there was not a proper plan which was thought through properly.\u0027Those two things I am assured we\u0027re going to answer today.\u0027 Mr Davis stressed that no final decision had been taken.\u0027It is a very, very delicate circumstance, and we\u0027ve got to make this judgment on a very careful, very deliberate, very well thought-through basis, knowing exactly ... how strong the evidence is,\u0027 he said.  The U.S. has maintained its threat of rocket attacks in response to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\u0027s sickening chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Douma on Saturday          General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of Joint Forces Command, said Russia\u0027s warnings that launch platforms could be targeted in response to air strikes meant \u0027they are going to try and sink ships, sink submarines and shoot aircraft out of the sky - that\u0027s war\u0027          David Davis today suggested he is ready to support reprisals on the Syrian regime, despite voting against them in 2013          British officials have been in in talks with their counterparts in France and the US about which military assets should be deployed for military action.          President Donald Trump said that an airstrike on Syria could be \u0027very soon or not so soon at all\u0027 as he took to Twitter this morning           It comes after Trump dramatically escalated the rhetoric yesterday by telling Russia to \u0027get ready\u0027 for military action, adding that \u0027nice and new and smart\u0027 cruise missiles \u0027will be coming\u0027 \u0027We are committed to deter and prevent the use of chemical weapons,\u0027 said a government source.\u0027We now have to establish the best way of getting there, and those conversations are carrying on, officials are speaking to their counterparts in France and America right now. In terms of precisely what happens next, that is still to be confirmed.\u0027Some senior ministers have privately been urging the PM to act. Speaking on a visit to Birmingham yesterday, Mrs May said: \u0027The continued use of chemical weapons cannot go unchallenged.\u0027Asked whether she was concerned by Mr Trump\u0027s tweet, she replied: \u0027We are working with our allies, we have been working to get an understanding of what happened on the ground. We are rapidly reaching that understanding. All the indications are that the Syrian regime was responsible.\u0027We will be working with our closest allies on how we can ensure that those who are responsible are held to account and how we can prevent and deter the humanitarian catastrophe that comes from the use of chemical weapons in the future.\u0027    The poll, conducted on Tuesday and yesterday, underlines the problems faced by Theresa May if she pushes ahead with military strikes          Mr Corbyn raised the spectre of Iraq as he made clear he would not back any kind of military action in Syria. In 2015 he defied much of his own shadow cabinet to vote against aistrikes against Isis in the country. \u0027Surely the lessons of Iraq, the lessons that came there from the Chilcot Report, are that there\u0027s got to be, there has to be, a proper process of consultation,\u0027 he said.\u0027We elect Parliament, we elect members of Parliament. They should have a voice in this. Cabinet on its own should not be making this decision.\u0027The dangers of bombing now, which could escalate the conflict beyond belief. Just imagine the scenario if an American missile shoots down a Russian plane or vice versa. Where do we go from there?\u0027 Tory former chancellor Mr Clarke called for a parliamentary vote on any military action, telling BBC Radio 4\u0027s World at One: \u0027In a modern, parliamentary democracy, I think you have got to have parliamentary approval if you have a planned, policy decision to launch a military attack of any significant size.\u0027To say that Parliament is just sidelined before you take such a serious decision is a very retrograde step. It makes parliamentary accountability fairly pathetic.\u0027 Julian Lewis, a Tory MP and chair of the Defence Select Committee, insisted there should be a vote before the UK took action. \u0027There is a real danger that what starts out as justified punishment for the use of chemical weapons ends up with the Royal Air Force serving as the air arm of the jihadi extremist rebels in Syria,\u0027 he said.\u0027It sends a very bad signal to the country that they don\u0027t submit themselves to parliamentary scrutiny before involving in taking military action by choice in the context of a civil war where both sides equally atrocious.\u0027      The US military appeared to be in position to carry out any attack order this morning with a Navy destroyer – armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles – underway in the eastern Mediterranean"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/11/4B131AE300000578-5607281-image-a-24_1523527959056.jpg","title":"Chickens filmed living corpses squalid conditions farms supply Nandos","story":"    Chickens are allegedly being forced to live in squalid and cramped conditions at Stewkley Farm in Buckinghamshire          The video, released by animal welfare charity PETA, shows the small chickens cooped up in long rows with barely any walking spaceThe charity believes the video contradicts Faccenda\u0027s claim on their website that \u0027good welfare is paramount and that means birds that are healthy and comfortable.\u0027PETA director Elisa Allen said: \u0027Faccenda Foods is trying to hoodwink compassionate consumers with its glib, baseless nods to animal welfare.\u0027PETA is calling on authorities to hold this company accountable for duping people into thinking otherwise.\u0027A PETA spokesperson added: \u0027This footage was recorded at a Faccenda farm.\u0027Faccenda is the second-largest chicken-processing company in the UK, supplying five of the largest retailers.\u0027The company claims: \u0027\u0027All our farms are certified to Red Tractor Farm Assurance standards, or equivalent, and we have a zero tolerance attitude toward anything that jeopardises the health and well-being of the animals in our care.\u0027Our birds might not able to talk but they are still the ones who tell us we\u0027re getting it right.\u0027\u0027The charity say they had also spotted signs of bumblefoot - a condition which causes pus-filled abscesses - on some birds.           The charity believes the video contradicts Faccenda\u0027s claim on their website that \u0027good welfare is paramount and that means birds that are healthy and comfortable\u0027          Many of the birds have lost feathers, which PETA says is probably due to stress, inadequate nutrition, or injuries inflicted by other birds          They claim the chickens have been bred to grow so large so quickly that their legs can become crippled, leaving them in agonising pain and unable to walk, eat, drink, or even standMany of the birds have lost feathers, which PETA says is probably due to stress, inadequate nutrition, or injuries inflicted by other birds.They claim the chickens have been bred to grow so large so quickly that their legs can become crippled, leaving them in agonising pain and unable to walk, eat, drink, or even stand.PETA said that chickens are killed at around 40 days old, when they reach \u0027slaughter weight\u0027.Other practices are said to include chickens being scalded in de-feathering tanks - sometimes while still conscious.Faccenda is the second-largest chicken-processing company in the UK and sells meat to national firms such as Asda, Lidl, and Nando\u0027s.A spokesman for the company said: \u0027All of our farms operate to standards above EU and UK legislation.\u0027They are independently audited and visited on a regular basis by an external vet to monitor bird health and welfare.\u0027Revealed: Salmonella in chicken salad killed 1 person and...Is the most Australian athlete ever?

Funnily enough, Zuckerberg’s own (open) Facebook page gives us a very good idea . . .Tycoon in trainingZuckerberg lists his childhood home as Dobbs Ferry, a commuter town just outside New York where he grew up one of four children of a psychiatrist called Karen and a dentist called Edward, whose nickname was ‘the Painless Dr Z’ and who worked from a surgery attached to the family home.Facebook finally gets in touch with Diamond and Silk a day...Is that you, Data? Twitter users go wild comparing Mark...Share this articleEdward, whose website boasts ‘we cater for cowards’, introduced Mark to computer programming at the age of 11. Within 12 months, he’d created a program that alerted his father when a patient had walked into the waiting room.While at boarding school, computer prodigy Mark then wrote a program that would recommend music to a user based on previous songs or albums they had listened to. Microsoft caught wind of it and offered to buy it, but he turned them down. He also turned down a lucrative job offer from the tech giant AOL in order to go to Harvard to study psychology and computer science. The rest, as they say, is history.College social climberThe creation of Facebook was, of course, chronicled in the hit film The Social Network, which portrays ‘Zuck’ as an insecure social climber who brutally dispensed with friends who helped build the company in its early days.Ironically, the movie’s writer, Aaron Sorkin, was once listed as one of Zuckerberg’s favourite film-makers. The endorsement vanished from the young tycoon’s Facebook page around the time the unflattering film came out.          Power couple: Mark and Priscilla married a day after the share offer that made them billionairesFor those who haven’t seen it, the movie tells how Facebook was originally designed in a university bedroom. Its purpose was to allow leering, male Harvard students to rate female peers in order of their attractiveness.One co-founder, a fellow student called Eduardo Saverin, ran the enterprise’s commercial side. But he was cruelly frozen out when Zuckerberg dropped out to run the site full-time. After a lengthy legal battle, Saverin got around £750 million in compensation.Also dispensed with were Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, fellow undergraduates who hired Zuckerberg to program a dating website and claimed key features of their idea were then stolen and used on Facebook. They received a reported £43 million in an out-of-court settlement.Chez ZuckerbergZuckerberg moved directly to Silicon Valley after dropping out of Harvard.His journey up the local property ladder has been avidly chronicled via his own website ever since, with the billionaire sharing regular behind-the-scenes images of his comparatively modest domestic set-up.For several years, he rented a four-bedroom house in a leafy suburb of Palo Alto — a wealthy city adjacent to San Francisco where almost every major internet firm is based — for a (by local standards) paltry £3,500 a month.          Wild: Zuckerberg and his wife and daughter in Where The Wild Things Are costumes (shown)He also drove a beaten-up Honda Acura, on the grounds that it was ‘safe, comfortable, not ostentatious’.Finally, in 2011, he became a homeowner, spending £4 million on a two-storey, five-bedroom property ten minutes from Facebook’s head office (where he typically works for 60-70 hours a week).He also upgraded his car to a Volkswagen Golf GTI, which he drives to company HQ at 8am in order to attend daily sessions with a personal trainer.The house is fashionably decorated, with wooden floors, beige carpets, and (famously) not a single television set.It’s a pretty humble abode for one of the world’s wealthiest men and supporters of Zuckerberg invariably like to observe that he has no time for the gated mansions and mega-yachts of other, more brash billionaires.What they usually fail to mention is that Zuckerberg also spent a punchy £21 million buying up all of the neighbouring houses that overlook his oh-so-humble home and its garden. And in 2014, he dropped another £75 million buying up 750 acres of the idyllic Hawaiian island of Kauai, in order — one assumes — to one day build a proper Bond -villain-style residence.The doctor wife          Zuckerberg jokes around about hard workAside from his trillion-dollar tech firm, Zuckerberg’s wife, Priscilla Chan, is the other great legacy of his stint at Harvard. The couple met one Friday night during a beer-fuelled party at the all-male ‘fraternity house’ where Mark lived. ‘He was this nerdy guy who was just a little bit out there,’ recalled ‘Cilla’, as she is known to friends, in a rare interview.History relates that they struck up a conversation while queuing for the loo: he charmed her with computer science-based ‘college humour’, apparently.After graduating from medical school, Priscilla, the daughter of Chinese ‘boat people’ from Vietnam, whose family fled communism during the Cold War, moved to Palo Alto and began working at San Francisco General Hospital.The couple moved in together in 2010, announcing this and every other formative step in their relationship via Facebook. ‘Now we have 2x everything, so if you need any household appliances, dishes, glasses, etc, please come by and take them before we give them away,’ they declared.The wedding was in 2012, days after the launch of Facebook on the stock market minted their status as billionaires, and they honeymooned in Rome, where they were photographed in that well-known Italian destination restaurant, McDonald’s.Though fully qualified as a paediatrician, Priscilla no longer has an employer to list on social media: like many a billionaire’s spouse, she devotes herself to philanthropy, running a personal charity dedicated to ‘advancing human potential and promoting equal opportunity’.Wacky home lifeThe business model of Facebook (not to mention the source of many of its recent troubles) rests on the belief that a person’s character is laid bare by the sort of thing they profess to ‘like’ on social media.On this front, Mark Zuckerberg has declared himself a fan of the sport of fencing, the pop acts Green Day, Taylor Swift, Shakira, and Jay-Z, the movie Gladiator and the fruity and violent TV series Game Of Thrones.He and Priscilla also try to find time in their busy schedules to cook family meals and bake bread, cakes and biscuits, and tend to celebrate special occasions by heading out to parties wearing wacky fancy dress outfits. Recent times have seen the family dress as Jedi knights, medieval warriors, and characters from the children’s book Where The Wild Things Are.          Face of a family: Mark Zuckerberg shown with his wife Priscilla and parents Edward and KarenWhat a psychologist might make of this is anyone’s guess, though his appearance in front of the U.S. Congress this week suggests the real Zuckerberg is nowhere near as free-wheeling and zany as his carefully curated Facebook page suggests.In fact, he’s a man with such apparent incapacity for introspection that many have suggested he may be autistic and even close friends admit that he often looks and sounds like a robot.In 2010, one told The New Yorker: ‘He’s been over-programmed.’Instead of spontaneously pursuing hobbies, Zuckerberg likes to give himself annual ‘challenges’, which he announces to his 107 m Facebook followers. They have included learning to speak Mandarin (‘some members of Priscilla’s family only speak Chinese and I want to be able to talk to them’) and, in 2011, to ‘only eat meat if I killed the animal myself’.Zuckerberg was once thought to be an atheist, but now likes to share photographs of his family celebrating Jewish festivals, stating in one caption: ‘I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period when I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.’ Priscilla, for her part, practises Buddhism.The doting dadLike millions of his users, Zuckerberg is an aficionado of ‘sharenting’ — the modern-day practice of using social media to bombard friends and acquaintances with sometimes intimate items of family news.In 2015, he told the world that Priscilla was pregnant for the first time in a heartfelt post revealing that she’d previously suffered three miscarriages, pledging to take two months’ paternity leave after becoming a father.          Zuckerberg is an aficionado of ‘sharenting’ — the modern-day practice of using social media to bombard friends and acquaintances with sometimes intimate items of family newsTheir daughter, Maxima, arrived later that year. Revealing the happy news, he used Facebook to announce that he intended to give away 99 per cent of his shares in the company during his lifetime, in an effort to make the world that she grows up in a ‘better place’.When a second girl, August, came along last summer, Zuckerberg uploaded a similarly preachy message, welcoming his newborn to the world via an open letter that urged her to make the most of childhood by finding as much time as possible to ‘go outside and play’.Somewhat awkwardly, Facebook made headlines just three months later by announcing it was launching Messenger Kids, a program designed to encourage his customers’ children to devote even more of their waking hours to staring at a screen.The fifth member of the Zuckerberg clan is Beast, a dreadlocked Hungarian sheepdog acquired from a breeder in Oregon in 2011.Naturally, the little fellow boasts his own Facebook page, with an astonishing 2.7 million followers. It contains videos of him performing a host of party tricks: dancing to rap music, barking at the Rocky theme tunes and scampering along a treadmill in his master’s home gymnasium.Although there’s also footage of Beast travelling to a rural farm to try his hand at herding sheep, the pooch’s days are largely spent in suburban Palo Alto, where his master can often be spotted walking him to the local park.          SURROUNDED: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the US Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill, April 10, 2018 in Washington, DCFrom time to time, like every member of the household, he’s also required to sacrifice his dignity to indulge Mark’s love of fancy dress. Recently, he’s been photographed in everything from Star Wars outfits to faux-medieval headgear and Jewish religious attire.That T-shirtSilicon Valley myth has it that Zuckerberg’s wardrobe is stuck in perpetual adolescence, with his supposed outfit of choice a grey T-shirt and dark hooded top teamed with grey jeans, which he once claimed to wear daily in order to limit time wasted making ‘frivolous decisions’, such as deciding what to wear.In 2012, he cemented this reputation for scruffiness by turning up in a ‘hoodie’ to pitch his multi-billion-dollar IPO share offer to Wall Street executives.Around the same time, he was said to have worn pyjamas to a meeting with financial backers.Zuckerberg’s Facebook page reveals something subtly different, however: he frequently does put on a suit and tie — provided it helps him keep up appearances.So it goes that he’s donned formal attire to meet everyone from Barack Obama to the Pope and, of course, to appear before Congress this week. He also dressed up for his wedding.At Facebook HQ, meanwhile, there’s no official dress code.          Members of the audience hold up signs and wear sunglasses that read \u0027Stop Spying\u0027 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the Commerce and Judiciary Committees on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, April 10, 2018But this trendy policy only extends so far: in a 2016 memoir, former employee Antonio Garcia Martinez claimed the male-dominated tech firm’s female employees were required to ‘avoid clothing that “distracted” co-workers’, adding that women who wore ‘revealing’ dresses were ‘read the riot act’.His foul mouthHowever carefully he might curate his public Facebook page, Zuckerberg hasn’t always behaved like a cuddly family man.In the early days, his business card read ‘I’m CEO, bitch,’ and, in private messages to colleagues, several of which became public during litigation, he described the site’s users as ‘dumb f**ks’ for handing over personal information to him for free.Time would, of course, prove him right: today, his 18 per cent stake in the firm provides him access to intimate details about the private lives of its two billion users. Every message they send, photograph they share and place from where they update their profile are stored on the company’s computer systems.For handing over this valuable resource, Facebook users have been paid precisely nothing.Whether Zuckerberg appreciates the responsibilities this ought to confer on him is hard to gauge.          In the well: Zuckerberg sat alone as he was questioned by the senatorsDuring the recent crisis over the firm Cambridge Analytica harvesting data from Facebook users — which knocked $60 billion off the value of the company’s shares — he took four days to make any statement and a further 24 hours to issue something approaching an apology.Presidential ambitionsSo convinced is Zuckerberg of his own brilliance that there is mounting speculation he’s thinking of one day mounting a bid for the U.S. presidency.To this end, he recently used Facebook to announce that he’s spending the year on a so-called ‘listening tour’ of all 50 U.S. states, ostensibly to listen to Facebook users, voters and local lawmakers, hiring Charles Ommanney, a photographer for the Bush and Obama campaigns, to document the exercise.His exact political allegiances are unclear: though undoubtedly a social liberal who vigorously supports gay rights and has been highly critical of Donald Trump’s policy towards immigrants and racial minorities, Zuckerberg is also thought to be fiscally conservative and his own company’s tax affairs are a case study in rapacious capitalism.He has appeared at fundraisers with the Republican governor Chris Christie in his native New Jersey, too, though the occasion was staged to mark his decision to donate $100 million to local schools, rather than to represent a political endorsement.Although he now employs Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe and his pollster Joel Benenson, and is certainly rich enough to run for the White House, he has repeatedly — for public consumption — denied any plans to run for office.Perhaps that’s just as well — for, as this week has shown, all the money in the world hasn’t helped this awkward young billionaire avoid a political car crash.

Footpaths are jostling with all sorts: groups of teenagers straggling back from the beach, families walking to lunch.About 150 metres from Cavill, in the heart of Surfers Paradise, a couple of backpackers eat their lunch in an otherwise empty laneway.Carla Viera runs the Orchid Vegetarian cafe, tucked away from the main strip. The period should be one of her busiest of the year – the temperature is still 27C and perfect for the beach. In Queensland, schools have been in recess since the Easter long weekend. And then there’s the Commonwealth Games, an event predicted to tip $323m directly into the local economy from Games tourists.“This is the most honest I can be,” Viera says between pulling coffees and grilling lunch for her two customers.“Last week, there was one day, from 6.30am to 10pm, when I closed there was $150 in the till. There was just nobody in the streets. So that’s how bad it was.”“I had all these staff that I hired and I had to let go. I feel bad for them, but it’s a survival thing. I still have to pay rent.“I’m OK here, I’m stocked up with coconut water and dry lentils, things that don’t go bad, but I really feel for the other businesses.”The same story is being echoed up and down the coast. A nearby shop that leases moped scooters, a favourite pastime of visitors to the glitter strip for decades, reports about half the number of customers than usual.Uber and cab drivers say their trade is well below normal. Prabh Jit Sings says it has been very quiet. Another cabbie, John, says he can barely find a fare from Surfer’s Paradise.“It’s OK traffic from the airport, but that’s it. No one is paying to go on public transport, so who needs a cab otherwise?”A lot of the anger seems to stem from an impression that Commonwealth Games organisers convinced some people to stay away. Locals and businesses had been sternly warned about the potential for traffic chaos and massive crowds during the Games fortnight.Almost a year ago, non-tourism businesses in the vicinity of Games venues were briefed about gridlock and urged to keep nonessential staff at home. Many decided to shut their doors and send staff on holidays, along with a large contingent of Gold Coast locals who opted to leave town.The Games chairman, Peter Beattie, told reporters this week that the M1 motorway, the main link between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, was “a bit of a dog, so the last thing we wanted was people on it”. For most of this Games, with fewer commuters on the roads and others scared away, the M1 has been a smooth run.Event spectators were encouraged to use public transport, including the city’s $1bn light rail network, which will be the Games’ most significant legacy infrastructure project. There have been few problems or delays getting to and from events. The Queensland tourism minister, Kate Jones, says the patronage figures for Games public transport will on Friday hit 2 million.“There were reports in the paper for months and months and months saying it was going to be chaos,” Jones said.Jones says visitor numbers are tracking towards 680,000, better than the 600,000 expected. She also said there would be long-term benefits to the coast from the exposure and infrastructure.“There’s no doubt that Easter weekend was slower than normal and I think that was because of people choosing to come later and stay at home over Easter,” Jones said.“Major hotel chains are reporting an increase of occupancy compared to this time of year.“There definitely seems to be a picking up, particularly when the athletics started. A lot of Gold Coasters who didn’t want to be a part of the Games thought it would be so busy they might have been better to get out.”Jones said some hotels had been “price gouging” in the hope of a payday that never came. Those that set reasonable prices sold out. She said those concerns about hotel prices and traffic problems might have initially discouraged people, but that 80,000 tickets to events had been sold since the opening ceremony.The director of corporate affairs at Gold Coast Tourism, Dean Gould, said “some operators are feeling very buoyed by the Games spin-off and others feeling like they might have missed out”.“The sentiment among retailers and restaurateurs is picking up in direction proportion to the crowds on the streets around their premises,” Gould said.“The Games has been a resounding success from the point of view of attracting visitors, selling tickets, filling stadiums and showcasing the destination to the world. We expect that positive exposure to support the destination marketing message for years.”A Griffith University report estimated that the federal and Queensland government spent a combined $1.78bn putting on the Games, with about $1.25bn in additional economic activity generated from the private sector.Of that, tourists who attended the Games were expected to generate $323m. But business owners say those figures clearly don’t reflect the reality on the ground.Kader Hammadi is the manager of the On Fire, a cafe in Broadbeach, which has been probably the most active of any of the coast’s main hubs. Hammadi’s cafe is 50 metres from a Games “festival” site, with live music, entertainment and big screens for events.“Even when they say there’s extra people in town, I don’t know where they are. They’re not in Currumbin, they’re not in Surfers, they’re not in Main Beach.

Saadawi’s novel, which the judges said “accrues in horrors as you move through it”, tells the story of a Baghdad junk dealer who assembles body parts left on the streets and stitches them together to make a political statement. The corpse goes missing, resulting in a series of eerie murders across the city.Han, who won the prize in 2016 for her novel The Vegetarian, is shortlisted for The White Book, which draws on her experience of losing an older sibling, who died before Han was born, and explores the various symbolic meanings of the colour white. Krasznahorkai is nominated for The World Goes On, a collection of 21 stories ning from a Hungarian interpreter contemplating his state of mind while in Shanghai to a child labourer who wanders off from a quarry.Also shortlisted is the Polish author Olga Tokarczuk’s Flights, the first of her novels to be translated into English. Exploring the concept of travel and anatomy, Flights s centuries, from the story of a 17th-century Dutch anatomist who dissected his own amputated leg, to a present-day Polish emigree returning to her home country to poison her terminally ill childhood sweetheart.Another contender is Virginie Despentes, a French journalist, filmmaker and former sex worker. Her novel Vernon Subutex 1 follows a Parisian record store owner who becomes homeless and, unbeknown to him, internet famous. Judges described the book as a “racy, sexy, urban, picaresque”. Spain’s Antonio Muñoz Molina, the author of more than a dozen novels, is nominated for Like a Falling Shadow, which explores the story of James Earl Ray, assassin of the American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, and the 10 days he spent in Lisbon while attempting to evade the FBI.The chair of judges, Lisa Appignanesi, said the 2018 shortlist was “only united in ersity. There are books with very strong narrative, books with lyrical atmosphere as their forefront, and books with a real density of metaphysical preoccupation. These six were definitely the best, in terms of the energy of the narrative and their formal exhilaration.”She said the judges had debated whether to include two previous winners. “We talked at length about not allowing repeat performances like Krasznahorkai and Han. But there was a sense we had to consider the novels and find the best fiction instead. And The White Book is so different from The Vegetarian that we could be talking about a different writer.” Joining Appignanesi on the judging panel are the translator and writer Michael Hofmann, the authors Hari Kunzru and Helen Oyeyemi, and the journalist Tim Martin. The winner will be announced 22 May at a dinner in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bc71b355b6b317a7dfe462cef75cad793391ab7/0_0_2643_1585/master/2643.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0746d3900a8dcac1ab803e0307acc6c2 1240w","title":"house prices generation rent estate agents demand mortgage lending decline","story":"Estate agents face a quiet house-buying season with demand and mortgage lending in declineApril traditionally marks the start of Britain’s house-buying season. Once the daffodils come out, estate agents ready themselves for a rush of prospective buyers.Just to be clear, this is not a national disaster: rather, the recent developments in the property market are inevitable and good. They show that even in the weird world of the UK property market – where demand is encouraged and supply restricted – the basic laws of economics sometimes operate.Demand for property is falling because asking prices are too high for buyers – even with interest rates at exceptionally low levels. Prices have been rising far faster than earnings and that has made it harder and harder for young people to get on to the property ladder.The house-price-to-earnings ratio needs to come down and a period of falling house prices makes that happen. That process is now under way as a result of squeezed living standards, less generous tax treatment for buy-to-let purchases and the prospect of higher interest rates that are all helping to prevent the cost of a home rising. For London specifically, there is also a Brexit effect.To be sure, estate agents are none too keen on the current state of affairs. Philip Hammond would probably like to see stronger housing market activity as well, since it would mean higher tax receipts. But the recurrent house price bubbles of the past four decades have not been good news for the economy. They have caused financial instability, distorted investment decisions and created intergenerational unfairness. Nobody in generation rent struggling to buy their first flat would think for a second that a period of falling prices was bad news.The difficult bit is that there is a sizeable – and vociferous – lobby that is opposed to Britain protecting aid spending when, at home, libraries are being closed, child benefit is being made less generous and the number of bobbies on the beat is dwindling. The rightwing press has long been calling for the Department for International Development (DfID) budget to be cut and it has been emboldened in recent weeks by the Haitian sex scandal that has engulfed Oxfam.Inevitably, this led to a few raised eyebrows. It would certainly be a retrograde step were aid to be used primarily for Britain’s own economic or defence ends, which is what some in the development community fear.There is no reason why this has to be the case. Private sector money is certainly going to be needed to finance Africa’s immense infrastructure requirements. The DfID guarantees that enable ports to be built would be a good use of public money. And if the aid budget can facilitate exports of UK-built wind turbines to Ethiopia, both sides gain.The harsh truth is that there is no viable alternative to Mordaunt’s approach. She can either protect her budget by giving it more of a British flavour or it will be whittled away. In the current difficult circumstances, that’s the choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ed34e3ce03635847a4cc44066f870c81d9dc1a9/1200_0_2780_1668/master/2780.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2ade2bcd345c1e43ab21893c12f8c0da 1240w","title":"job losses 2 sisters chicken supplier plant closure cambuslang scotland","story":"Chicken supplier hit by scandal over undercover report last year to close Cambuslang plantHundreds of poultry workers in Scotland are to lose their jobs due to the closure of a plant belonging to 2 Sisters Food Group, which has been dogged by a controversy over food standards.On Thursday, the UK’s biggest supplier of supermarket chicken said it will shut the Cambuslang factory in South Lanarkshire in August. The site employs about 450 people.It comes after 2 Sisters said in February that 900 jobs were at risk as the company considered whether to close two West Midlands factories in Smethwick and Wolverhampton, plus Cambuslang. That announcement followed a nightmare year for the company, including a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation that prompted production to be suspended for five weeks last autumn at the group’s West Bromwich plant.In a statement confirming the closure of Cambuslang, the company said: “This is not a decision we take lightly. Since day one, we have been very open on the big challenges the factory faces.“In fact, we have been trying extremely hard to reverse the position for a considerable period of time. We have invested several million pounds since 2014 and expanded by taking on more people, yet it is still a heavily lossmaking operation.“We have tried every turnaround option available to us for several years, ranging from cost-reduction measures to an attempt to grow the business organically. It has made little difference.”The group said it was “trying hard to find openings both inside and outside the business, so we’re hopeful compulsory redundancies can be kept to a minimum”.It has previously said that alongside the factory closures, 2 Sisters has plans to create 915 jobs at other plants around the UK, including 250 at another Scotland factory in Coupar Angus.The undercover reports led to an investigation into 2 Sisters by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which highlighted “several process weaknesses and regulatory failures”.The footage shot at 2 Sisters’ West Bromwich chicken plant showed poultry being dropped on the floor and returned to the production line, as well as an instance of labels recording the slaughter dates of birds being changed.The company had claimed there was an innocent explanation for changing the labels, but the FSA report concluded: “No justification for this incident of label changes could be established.”The chicken processor denied the film showed any food safety breaches and said it had temporarily suspended production at the factory because of process failures, adding that its “internal investigation has shown some isolated instances of non-compliance with our own quality management systems”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4623211e17b3c2b5d064bd18c9460a158a7241d6/172_351_3364_2019/master/3364.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fb6312c0e92386d5cc0f965386e9c21b 1240w","title":"mark zuckerberg log off facebook congress","story":"I hate Facebook as much as the next person, but prior to this week I had no intention of boycotting it. The gesture would, I told myself, be both meaningless and totally unrealistic. I have never successfully given up a single bad habit – bacon, Milky Ways, leaving the dishes in the sink overnight – so why would the urge to check Facebook work out any different?And in bald outline, the Cambridge Analytica story wasn’t enough of an impetus to change. After the news broke, most people I know, while tutting and fretting over how awful it all was, also believed themselves to be entirely immune to the effects of propaganda and ad targeting. For idiot racists, data harvesting is a prelude to mind control for the rest of us it’s an abstract political problem.Or at least it was until this week. I have occasionally had sympathy for people who create something that becomes much bigger than anticipated and then have to scramble to explain what they’ve done. (I always thought Simon Cowell was a stark example of this, someone who, while no doubt appalling in lots of ways, was made to answer too widely for bad taste in primetime TV).If I had given Mark Zuckerberg much thought before now, I would probably have put him in a similar category, as someone I considered with vague distaste but no real animosity. Then several things happened in rapid succession to recategorise Facebook in my mind from a simple bad habit – in which the onus was on me, the addict, to seek help or move on – to something else: an entity whose sole purpose is to take the piss out of its users.It was a piece in the New York Times last week that articulated this fact more clearly than I have seen elsewhere and in a way that finally drove the point home: we, as Facebook users, are not the company’s customers but the company’s product.The other lightbulb moment came courtesy of Zuckerberg’s appearance before the Senate committee, which not only provided a handy and highly personalised visual on which to hang one’s dislike – the bland face, the android expression, the cult-like choice of Facebook-blue tie – but also offered cast-iron proof of the company’s bad faith.It was Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator for South Carolina, who finally flushed out the disingenuousness at the heart of Facebook’s utopian mission statement. Graham invited Zuckerberg to remember an internal memo that circulated at Facebook in 2016 in which the author, Andrew Bosworth, a vice-president of the company who once taught Zuckerberg at Harvard, jocularly noted that while maybe Facebook “costs a life by exposing someone to bullies” or “maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools”, hey-ho, “anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good”.No action was taken against Bosworth, and even though Zuck assured the senators he didn’t agree with the memo’s statement, he also added, in a winsome aside: “Boz is what we call him internally.” For some reason it was the chummy cuteness of “Boz” that put the final nail in the coffin. That’s it, I’m done 24 hours clean and it feels tremendous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df25b5fe1a2e42950f1b03fc667dbb0523c2ec93/0_55_1717_1030/master/1717.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7f320c1e5e151dc804411fff1ef0bb86 1240w","title":"the guardian view on arms control signing up must mean something","story":"In 2013, Barack Obama made a bargain with Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, brokered by Russia, the latter’s ally. The United States withdrew its threat to attack Mr Assad’s regime for using sarin against Syrians in Damascus that summer. Hundreds died in the deadliest use of chemical weapons since the Iran–Iraq war. Mr Assad denied he had used such weapons, but in return for US restraint his regime agreed to dismantle its chemical weapons programme. Much of the country’s banned substances were thought to have been destroyed, and Syria joined the treaty against their use.Yet as the years have unfolded, Mr Assad, a ruthless dictator who the world would be better without, has made a mockery of the agreement. Syria’s civil war, now in its seventh year, has been wreathed in toxic fumes. Experts from the UN and the chemical weapons watchdog said the Syrian regime has used helicopters to dump chlorine gas on opponents. Chlorine is not a banned substance, since it has commercial uses, but its use as a weapon is. The watchdog last year said Mr Assad’s forces also used sarin gas, a nerve agent, to kill more than 90 people in Khan Sheikhun. There have been an estimated score or more of incidents of chemical weapons use since then.These are heinous crimes using weapons of mass destructive terror. It’s not that these weapons kill on any wider a scale than heavy artillery does, but that they kill in a very cruel way. People die in their beds, clutching babies and loved ones. The ability to burn people inside out sends fearful shivers through populations. The use of chemical weapons amounts to official terrorism, corrupting further a corrupt regime. Mr Assad does not care it has been effective, even in smaller doses than the 2013 attack, to evict insurgents from their sanctuaries, forcing them to keep moving and making it harder to regroup, with consequent demoralisation.Mr Assad has been allowed to act with murderous impunity because of his backers in Moscow. Russia has vetoed critical resolutions at the UN security council in relation to Syria. To deter Mr Assad from using chemical weapons, the United States, France and the UK are considering military action – although Donald Trump followed bombastic threats by tweeting he never said “when an attack on Syria would take place”. Too large an attack might lead to a dangerous escalation with Russia in a country that Moscow has used as a testing ground for sophisticated weaponry, a fact demonstrated when anti-aircraft fire brought down an Israeli F-16 fighter jet in February.Vladimir Putin’s Russia has largely fallen out of love with arms control, seeing the rules-based order as a way of reducing its influence and stature in the world. Moscow wants Russia’s power to reflect its gigantic geography rather than its puny economy and almost non-existent political magnetism. Russia is similar to North Korea and Iran in seeking strength through having adversaries. But in eliciting global condemnation they achieve weakness.In the longer term, the only way to bring back rogue nations into compliance will be through reestablishing the fundamental premise of why arms control agreements exist. Countries enter into them not for the sake of moral principle but because they help to set up the rules for military strategy. Key to this is developing ways to avoid war, minimising the competition between military powers, and curtailing the scope of violence if the fighting does break out. In Syria, the Russians and Iranians have lost sight of these things. Precipitate military action without parliamentary scrutiny will not help. What will is establishing a wider cost for such awful behaviour.• This article was updated on 12 April 2018 to clarify the Guardian’s stance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0aa3e7cd22cc6bf38adfb83f409ac5452931cb/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cd10974c2d651943b8db1cb3b91483cb 1240w","title":"pollutionwatch bicycles take over city of london rush hour","story":"This is good news for air pollution in an area that breaches EU limit values for nitrogen dioxide, but an increase in active travel has many other benefits: less road traffic noise, fewer climate change emissions and people benefiting from more exercise.

The design is not dissimilar to that of a Scalextric track, although should the vehicle overtake, the arm is automatically disconnected.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.comThe electrified road is ided into 50m sections, with an inidual section powered only when a vehicle is above it.When a vehicle stops, the current is disconnected. The system is able to calculate the vehicle’s energy consumption, which enables electricity costs to be debited per vehicle and user.The “dynamic charging” – as opposed to the use of roadside charging posts – means the vehicle’s batteries can be smaller, along with their manufacturing costs.A former diesel-fuelled truck owned by the logistics firm, PostNord, is the first to use the road.Hans Säll, chief executive of the eRoadArlanda consortium behind the project, said both current vehicles and roadways could be adapted to take advantage of the technology.In Sweden there are roughly half a million kilometres of roadway, of which 20,000km are highways, Säll said.“If we electrify 20,000km of highways that will definitely be be enough,” he added. “The distance between two highways is never more than 45km and electric cars can already travel that distance without needing to be recharged. Some believe it would be enough to electrify 5,000km.”At a cost of €1m per kilometre, the cost of electrification is said to be 50 times lower than that required to construct an urban tram line.Säll said: “There is no electricity on the surface. There are two tracks, just like an outlet in the wall. Five or six centimetres down is where the electricity is. But if you flood the road with salt water then we have found that the electricity level at the surface is just one volt. You could walk on it barefoot.”National grids are increasingly moving away from coal and oil and battery storage is seen as crucial to a changing the source of the energy used in transportation. The Swedish government, represented by a minister at the formal inauguration of the electrified road on Wednesday, is in talks with Berlin about a future network. In 2016, a 2km stretch of motorway in Sweden was adapted with similar technology but through overhead power lines at lorry level, making it unusable for electric cars.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The document notes that “misconduct … often occurs outside of the formal workplace setting”.“We are committed to addressing the scenario that has allowed predators to exploit performers behind closed doors under the guise of a professional meeting,” said Gabrielle Carteris, Sag-Aftra president.In the unlikely event that the meeting cannot take place in a more open setting, the document suggests that a “support peer” be present. It is part of a new initiative by the union to confront and help eradicate harassment and assault in the industry. In February, a detailed code of conduct was also released.“All professionals, including Sag-Aftra members, are expected to refrain from engaging in harassing conduct and support efforts to eliminate this scourge from the workplace,” the union said.The move has been welcomed by the Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace, a group assembled by the Writers Guild of America.“The commission applauds Sag-Aftra’s recently issued guideline number one,” said Anita Hill, who spearheads the group, in a statement. “The implementation of this guideline marks an important first step in communicating appropriate industry standards for professional practices.”The move follows on from a string of accusations against a number of major industry players, including Harvey Weinstein who has been accused of assaulting women in hotel rooms.

It won plenty of awards, but the 30-year-old faced a dark backlashA few months after the actor, musician and author Nakhane started receiving online death threats, he developed an unorthodox reaction to them. Call it a coping mechanism, but the 30-year-old could not help but assess the linguistic flair of his fellow South Africans. “It was interesting for my own people to describe in great detail how they wanted to kill me,” he says, softly. “But some of the descriptions were so poetic that I was like: ‘Hey, people can write. They can write, eh?’” He lets out a dry chortle, spiked with weariness, and leans in over his post-photoshoot glass of red wine. “It was poetic, but dark.”He is a long way from home, sitting in a north London bar, but the ripple effects of the acting role that inspired graphic threats against his life still resonate. Nakhane stars in The Wound (Inxeba), a tender and intimate film that weaves one story, of male same-sex desire in rural South Africa, with another, about what happens when urbanised and queer teen Kwanda (played by newcomer Niza Jay Ncoyini) kicks back against ingrained tradition. It is a film so visceral you find yourself clenching your fists and wincing while anticipating the slap of violence during its most tense scenes.But, really, the reason so much anger was directed at Nakhane, his co-stars and the director, John Trengove, was because The Wound features approximate depictions of ulwaluko – the secret rite of passage into manhood observed by the Xhosa tribe – and guy-on-guy sex scenes. Implying that the initiation, which involves circumcision, could have any proximity to homosexuality was more than some people could take. Add to that a white director telling a black African story and controversy followed the film at every turn. For Nakhane, who is still clumsily referred to as “openly gay” in the local press, that reaction seeped into his own life.“Initially, people jumped to conclusions that the film would be some sort of exposé” – and he laces his next line with sarcasm – “because that would be interesting … They saw a trailer. They saw queerness. And they went nuts, because: ‘How dare you?’.” Outrage ensued, in verbal statements given by the Xhosa king, on the streets, in the media and on the internet. Nakhane recalls one protest at Wits University in Johannesburg: “There was a standoff between people on either side of the argument. This guy kept shouting about: ‘IF it’s true, IF this happens between men,’ and I couldn’t get him out of my head.” That is because Nakhane’s experience goes beyond the hypothetical. “I was propositioned. I” – and he points at his chest – “me. And not once. So I know from direct experience. And what’s next after that? To say that I’m lying?”He exhales these sentences with an animated passion, all hand sweeping and eye-rolls. He manages to be warm, even when recounting how one of his social media posts promoting the film spread a rage through his Xhosa community “like a wildfire”. His magnetic personality seems antithetical to that of Xolani, his character in the film, who maintains a secret love affair with Vija, a fellow caregiver to the teenage boys when they travel to a remote mountain for the initiation. “To prepare,” he recalls, “John said to me: ‘Imagine who you are and that everyone in the world loves you. It’s a warm day. Can you feel it?’ Yes, I could. ‘OK, so take that feeling, put it in a box and squash it. That’s where you are, as a character.’”Although Nakhane speaks freely about his sexual orientation – largely at the prompting of journalists, it must be said – he, too, used to be closeted, like Xolani. He was born in Alice, once a model town for apartheid regime propaganda in the Eastern Cape, where heteronormative views ruled. At the age of 15, he moved to Johannesburg, and came out a few years later. He briefly reverted to a form of “pray the gay away” fundamentalism and lived in denial about his sexual preferences, but, by his late 20s, with a career as a soulful pop performer blossoming, he had accepted himself at last.“Now, my sister tells me about friends of hers in school who were gay and out in grade 8, aged 14. And I’d ask how that was being received: ‘No one cares.’ I never would have dreamed, at 14, of being able to do that. Fourteen! I mean, I was feisty to come out at 17.” He laughs again.While the film racked up awards, from the Durban and London film festivals to LGBT film festivals in Madrid, San Francisco and Lisbon, one branch of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa worked with the country’s Man and Boy Foundation to have it censored on its release in February. The Wound ended up with an X18 rating from the country’s censor, a classification generally reserved for porn – before its backers went to court in an attempt to have a less restrictive rating.Speaking via Skype, Trengove reflected on a tumultuous ride. As a white director, he has dealt with another layer of backlash, from those who think he should not have told this story. He chooses his words carefully, pointing out how he co-wrote the script with Thando Mgqolozana and Malusi Bengu, both Xhosa men. “From the beginning, my own whiteness was a huge thing to reconcile, or at least grapple with, in the construction of the film,” he says. “The difficulty and discomfort of it is something I knew I was taking on. But the reasons for making the film under these circumstances outweighed those for not making it.”He has watched The Wound prompt debate about race, tradition, what constitutes pornography, and gayness – in a country whose progressive constitution protects LGBT rights in theory, but less so in practice.All the drama surrounding the film, though, may distract from a simple fact: Nakhane’s performance is a delicate revelation. His past work as a musician and author (his debut novel, Piggy Boy’s Blues, was published in 2015) informs the emotional depths he plumbs in this first-ever professional acting role.“He brought an understanding that, in order to do interesting work, you have to step outside your own comfort zone,” Trengove says. “It’s something a lot of actors struggle with, which he did very intuitively. And that is what you see in the film.” He adds: “There’s something incredibly expressive about Nakhane, a way in which what’s going on, on the inside, pours out of him. He has a translucency that I knew could work on camera.”It beams out in person, too. When I ask how he reflects on the fever of the backlash, from this vantage point thousands of miles away, his eyes lock into focus. “Some people say: ‘Aren’t you tired of always having to talk about the fact that you’re a gay artist?’ and I’m like: ‘You have no fucking idea how tired I am of it.’ But for as long as I need to, I’m going to talk about it. Sure, it’s annoying that sometimes you see an article that splashes with ‘GAY MUSICIAN’, but do you know how many openly gay musicians there are in South Africa?”He looks resolute, calm. “For as long as it needs to be said, then it needs to be said. For as long as there’s some kid out there who can’t be themselves, he’ll need someone.”The Wound is in UK cinemas from 27 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b57e5bbac62002abe60b90db85ec57be80566904/105_8_2354_1412/master/2354.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=97d76f4c32046a2bac9d47ea73d2f63a 1240w","title":"cska moscow arsenal europa league quarter final second leg match report","story":"Arsenal being Arsenal, it was never going to be straightforward. For much of the evening Arsène Wenger’s players did their best to emulate Barcelona’s performance at Roma on Tuesday in a way that nobody at Arsenal would have wanted as CSKA Moscow threatened to overturn a three-goal deficit and inflict the sort of humiliation that the Frenchman would have struggled to survive.Yet with CSKA two goals to the good, courtesy of close-range efforts from Fedor Chalov and Kirill Nababkin, and chasing the decisive third blow that would have seen Arsenal eliminated in the most remarkable fashion, the Premier League club found salvation in the shape of Danny Welbeck. Relief coursed through Wenger, his staff and the Arsenal players after the England forward scored 15 minutes from time to give them the breathing space that they so badly needed.By the time Aaron Ramsey sprinted clear of the CSKA defence to add a second, deep into injury time, Arsenal were no longer on the path to self-destruction and the 300 or so travelling supporters could celebrate the prospect of a first European semi-final in nine years. To say that Arsenal made hard work of things, however, barely does it justice.This was a desperately poor performance from an Arsenal team who seemed to be sleepwalking their way through the game for long periods. There was so little conviction and intensity about their approach – they failed to register a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes – and a sense of panic set in from the moment CSKA took the lead.Arsenal were toothless until Welbeck scored, overrun in midfield and an accident waiting to happen at the back, where Petr Cech also endured a difficult night. The Arsenal goalkeeper was far from alone in that respect, however, and it was alarming to see a limited CSKA Moscow side cause so many problems.Yet all that matters for Wenger and his players now is that Arsenal’s hopes of winning the Europa League remain alive – leaving the door open to qualifying for the Champions League next season – and that next month’s final in Lyon is one step closer, with the draw for the semi-finals taking place in Switzerland on Friday and Atlético Madrid the team to avoid.Whoever Arsenal face next, they will have to play far better than they did here. “I feel that maybe we were a bit surprised by the intensity and not at the races in the first half,” Wenger said. “They scored the second and even then they have another chance to make it three.The onus had been on CSKA to take the game to Arsenal because of the 4-1 deficit from the first leg, yet that rarely looked like happening in a drab opening half hour in which the noise created by the partisan home supporters was far more impressive than anything their players produced on the pitch.Arsenal, though, found themselves a goal behind from the first decent chance CSKA created. The damage was done on the Arsenal right, where Konstantin Kuchaev had too much space to deliver a cross that was met by the head of Nababkin, who towered above Nacho Monreal. Cech, ing low to his right, managed to keep the effort out but Chalov reacted to the loose ball quicker than Shkodran Mustafi and stabbed it home from a couple of yards.Suddenly Arsenal had a game on their hands. Kristijan Bistrovic’s rising first-time shot from just outside the area flashed past an upright and within five minutes of the restart the home team had a second. It was a desperately poor goal to concede in so many respects and started with Ramsey giving the ball away inside his own half.The influential Aleksandr Golovin picked up possession a couple of passes later and with no Arsenal player attempting to close him down, the midfielder accepted the invitation to shoot from 30 yards. Cech was well-positioned to make the save but the Arsenal goalkeeper made a pig’s ear of things and succeeded only in parrying the ball into the path of Nababkin, who swept home emphatically.Golovin’s free-kick was turned around a post by Cech moments later and Arsenal were on the rack, prompting Wenger to replace Jack Wilshere, who picked up a slight ankle injury, with Calum Chambers. Though he gave them another body in defence, it was a moment of inspiration from Welbeck that provided Arsenal with respite. A lovely exchange with Mohamed Elneny was followed by a coolly taken finish from the in-form forward, who has now scored five goals in as many games. Ramsey, running on to another Elneny pass, then completed the fightback."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06e9b1917306db9d677cc57f9f653e0f88337771/121_238_2682_1609/master/2682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b32bc55d5935723cf6138f7ce04631b2 1240w","title":"harry kane mauling social media pochettino","story":"• Goal award attracted comment from Golden Boot rival Mo Salah• Fans of other clubs will have killed him, Spurs manager addsMauricio Pochettino believes Harry Kane will “learn a lot” from the controversy over Tottenham’s second goal against Stoke last Saturday. Spurs chose to appeal a decision to award the goal to Christian Eriksen, after Kane claimed the Dane’s free-kick touched his shoulder on the way into the net.The Premier League goals accreditation panel this week upheld the complaint and gave the goal to Kane. Pochettino said the process had not caused any tension in his camp and insisted he trusts Kane, who is an “honest” player.The Spurs manager did admit, however, that the strength of the public response – which include messages on social media from Mo Salah, Kane’s rival for the Golden Boot – had caught the striker by surprise. “Of course, he never thought that this situation would escalate, when he was so certain that he touched the ball,” Pochettino said. “After the game Harry said he touched the ball with a shoulder, he told Christian. I think Harry is a very honest person, he’s not going to lie about this situation. It’s not a big issue for the team.“People have opinions, but that is normal. He was disappointed because he never wanted to create this. Sometimes it can seem a simple thing, and then it becomes big and you can’t stop it. That is what happened here. I think he is going to learn a lot from this you know.”Spurs play Manchester City at Wembley on Saturday with Kane hoping to close the gap on Salah in the race to be the ision’s top scorer. Kane has 25 Premier League goals to the Egyptian’s 29.When asked if the week’s activity might provide extra motivation for Salah, however, Pochettino replied: “If Salah needs this situation to inspire him? Come on, you make me laugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd83af11fe96c8bc498c8e9ee39c27a291d6a64d/470_179_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=04e3498d459046467a872a658f749d35 1240w","title":"cska moscow v arsenal europa league quarter final live","story":"Arsenal are into their first European semi-final for nine years and thus their season remains very much alive. They flirted with danger here, falling two goals behind on the night, before Danny Welbeck eased their nerves by scoring a beauty. Ramsey topped off a satisfying night with another goal in stoppage time. They will have to improve to get through the semi-finals, where they will meet one of Marseille, Atletico Madrid or Salzburg. Here are today’s other results:Elneny claims another assist, slipping a pass through to Ramsey , who eat the offside trap and then chips the advancing goalkeeper. Arsenal are into the semi-finals!90+1 min: On another Arsenal counter, Ramsey rolls the ball to his right so that Welbeck can fire off a shot on the run. He bangs it off from 18 yards. But the keeper bats it away.90 min: There will be at least three more minutes. There is no sign that Arsenal are going to do anything ridiculous during that time.88 min: Koscielny clears a tame cross. All belief has drained from CSKA. Arsenal bound forward and see if they can help themselves to another goal. Ozil presents Iwobi with an ideal chance to do exactly that, but Iwobi shanks a sidefooter from 12 yards, sending it wide by almost as much.86 min: Welbeck is everywhere now. All Arsenal’s attacks are revolving around him, and even CSKA’s attempted clearances are tending to find him. 84 min: Iwobi leads a counter-attack. He sends it wide to Ozil on the left. The German’s cross it put behind for a corner. Ozil delivers an out-swinger. Chambers gets his nut to it near the penalty spot, but it’s an easy save for the keeper.82 min: Nababkin flings in a long throw. That triggers momentary chaos in the Arsenal box, until the ref blows for a foul on Monreal.80 min: That goal by Welbeck was so good that it may help make up Gareth Southgate’s mind about taking him back to Russia for the World Cup.CSKA substitution: Milanov on, Chalow off. “You’ll be delighted to learn that the German for ‘phew’ is ‘puh!’,” reports Dominik Wallerius.That’s a superb goal! After a prolonged Arsenel possession play, Welbeck beat Nababkin with a wonderful turn wide on the left and then swapped passes with Elneny and curled an excellent finish into the far corner from 12 yards. Marvelous work by Welbeck and that should seal a place in the semi-final!74 min: Welbeck wins a freekick mid-way inside the CSKa half. Ozil floats it into the box. Iganshevich heads it back out. 72 min: Golovin overhits a cross, giving an increasingly wobbly Arsenal a moment to try to steady themselves.70 min: Panicky defending by Arsenal. Elneny garryowens the ball out of his box. Ozil ducks to avoid the dropping ball. Iganshevich, of all people, pounces on it and cracks off a fierce low shot from 25 yards. It whizzes just past the post!66 min: Ozil swings over a corner. It’s flicked on (by Mustafi?). Koscielny, tries to slash it into the net at the back post but he’s off balance and can’t keep the shot down. Arsenal substitution: Chambers on, Wilshere off. The midfielder isn’t limping but may still have a sore ankle following that accident in the first half. Or maybe he was withdrawn because he kept giving the ball away in the second half. 65 min: A lucky ricochet off the referee puts Arsenal into an attacking position! Ozil’s shot is blocked but he fights to force a corner. “I hope these last couple of years at Arsenal won’t cloud over the fact that Petr Cech has been one of the greatest goalkeepers over the last two decades,” says Upender. “Only Buffon, Neur, Casillas, De Gea and Van der Sar have been better.” Yes, he was superb. He’s dwindling now, alas.63 min: Wilshere gives the ball in midfield. CSKA romp forward. Then they slow down and probe. But Arsenal regrouped well to close down any openings.61 min: Penalty!? The crowd yelp with glee after the ref points to the spot when Musa goes down under an untidy challenge by Mustafi. But it turns out the ref was not point to the spot, he was signalling for a goal kick. What’s the German for ‘phew’? 59 min: Elneny seems to have gone back into the defence again. He seems to have been assigned, of is treating himself to, a floating role. But this avant-garde approach isn’t making Arsenal any more secure...57 min: Elneny guides a lovely header into the bottom corner of the net! But the goal is correctly ruled out for offside. 57 min: Elneny appears to have gone back into midfield. The back five wheeze lasted 10 minutes. 56 min: Arsenal steady themselves with some confidence-building passing in the opposing half. They don’t threaten to break through but at least they don’t break down.55 min: Ozil darts past V Berezutski deep in his own half. The centreback makes sure Ozil doesn’t go on to start a counter-attack by chopping him down. He’s lucky not to be shown a yellow card.53 min: Golovin curls the freekick over the wall and towards the bottom far corner. Cech es like a felled tree and paws it around the post. 52 min: Ramsey concedes a freekick by tripping Golovin. It’s about 22 yards out, to the left ...Oh Arsenal! Golovin let fly with a swirling shot from 30 yards, Cech couldn’t hold it and doesn’t manage to push it very far away. Nababkin reacts faster than Monreal and lashes the bouncing ball into the net from a difficult angle! 49 min: Vitinho receives the ball in the box, does a little spin and clips it towards Chalov in the centre. Monreal heads it away.47 min: CSKA have more zip in their play already. Elneny seems to have dropped deeper for Arsenal, serving now as a third centreback. Arsenal, then, have switched into holding mode. Which is not to be confused with Holding mode.46 min: The teams are back on the pitch, including Wilshere.Since you’re here, why not sign up for our free, (occasionally) funny, (usually) 5pm-ish email, the Fiver? Here are the half-time scores from the other quarter-finals:The visitors are in danger of Arsenaling this up. They were on easy street for most of the match but ended up conceding a goal and becoming ragged. Suddenly their path to the semi-finals looks a lot more awkward than it should have done. CSKA have got their danders up and look dangerous going forward. And Wilshere limped down the tunnel at the break with a sore ankle: he may not return for the second half. 45+3 min: Wilshere attempts to play a one-two. His pass is poor ... and then he goes down and appeals for treatment. He looks in pain and is clutching his left ankle. No one touched him but perhaps he rolled it?45+1 min: Ramsey is back on. There will be at least three more minutes in this half.45 min: CSKA are playing with renewed confidence. They work the ball beautifully behind the Arsenal defence. Bistrovic cuts the ball back across the face of goal from the right. And Monreal wellies it clear before Musa can pounce!44 min: Arsenal, so comfortable for much of the match, are flailing a little now, looking a tad ragged, especially with Ramsey still off the pitch.43 min: A CSKA corner is cleared as far as the edge of the box. Bistrovic wraps his right foot around it and tries to guide it towards the top corner. he misses by a yard! 41 min: There’s a pause in play because Ramsey is down in need of treatment after mist-timing a tackle on Bistorvic. The boos from the home crowd suggest they think he’s trying to waste time and and interrupt CSKA’s momentum. But the Welshman is carried off on a stretcher to receive treatment. Straight after losing Dzagoev, CSKA get themselves back into the tie! Kuchaev sent over a cross from the left. Monreal was outjumped by Nababkin, whose header was parried by Cech. Chalow reacted quicker than Mustafi and hammered the ball into the net from close range!CSKA substitution: Vitinho on, Dzagoev off. CSKA’s best player has to withdraw because of an injury, though I can’t tell you what is wrong with him. 37 min: Golovin fluffs a chance at one end - failing to get off a shot after dashing into a good position - and then Arsenal hare down the other end and create an opening of their own. Welbeck sends a low ball across the face of goal ... just beyond Ozil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43aa1715ad36aee694d4fbbe76f809d5039da2fe/1345_1100_3791_3792/master/3791.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=57f8294da13d2768d2d11ba93f86e11f 1240w","title":"felicity cloake masterclass mayonnaise recipe","story":"Back away from the shop-bought stuff and make a mayo to remember with these easy stepsWith a few exceptions, commercial mayonnaise is to homemade as processed cheese is to mature cheddar – convenient, but hard to get excited about. Proper mayo, gently wobbly and yolk-yellow, is a quite different beast: too good to hide away in a sandwich, it deserves to be the star of the show, served with crunchy baby veg, fresh seafood or just a big pile of hot, salty chips.1 egg yolk1 big pinch salt1 tbsp dijon mustard1 tbsp white-wine or cider vinegar, or lemon juice250ml light olive, grape seed, sunflower or other neutral oil25ml extra-virgin olive, walnut or rapeseed oilEnsure everything is at room temperature before you get going. This makes the finished product much less likely to split. So, if you keep your eggs in the fridge, take them out at least 30 minutes before you start work.This small amount of mayonnaise is hard to make in most food mixers, but electric beaters will do the trick, as will a whisk and a bit of elbow grease. You will also need a large, sturdy bowl. If you happen to have a stick blender and a tall jug in which it fits snugly, go to step 7.Put a damp cloth under the bowl to anchor it, then put the egg yolk and salt in the bowl. Whisk for about 20 seconds, until slightly thickened, then add the mustard and acid (and a teaspoon of cold water if you’re nervous, though it’s not strictly necessary). Whisk for another 30 seconds. Familiarise yourself with step 6 before going any further.Begin to add the oil into the bowl, drop by painstaking drop, whisking all the time. Don’t be tempted to use extra-virgin olive oil, because this will make a heavy, often bitter mayonnaise, especially if you’re using electric beaters. It’s far better, and cheaper, to start with a neutral oil and add some extra-virgin at the end.Keep whisking and pouring until the mayonnaise begins to thicken, at which point you can begin to add the oil more quickly, followed by a second, more flavourful oil, if you like. Once all 275ml of the oil has been incorporated and you have a thick, glossy mixture, season to taste. If you’d prefer a thinner consistency, beat in a little water, lemon juice or vinegar.If your mayonnaise splits, it’s easily rescued, as long as you have another egg yolk. Crack this into a fresh bowl, whisk for a minute until thick and sticky, then gradually beat in the split mayonnaise a little at a time, followed by any remaining oil.If you have a stick blender, put all the ingredients except the extra-virgin olive oil into a jug just slightly wider than the blender head. Plunge the blender down to the base of the jug, then turn on and, keeping the blender still, blend on high power for 10 seconds, until you can see the mixture start to emulsify.Once the mayonnaise begins to billow out from the sides of the blender, very slowly move the head upwards through the oil until you have a creamy mayonnaise (repeat this process, if necessary). Beat in the extra-virgin olive oil by hand, then season to taste.Mayonnaise is easy to tailor to need or occasion: fold in a clove of crushed garlic, or a handful of chopped herbs, the zest of an unwaxed lemon, black pepper, chilli sauce, horseradish or wasabi, smoked paprika and lime juice, crumbled blue cheese and chives, curry powder, finely chopped capers anchovies or cornichons, wholegrain mustard – but preferably not all at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb8e4245e683c703eb722af6978719efdb671cdf/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4d6db19fddb35dd028bc204a07afcc5f 2600w","title":"ultra processed truth 10 bestselling foods cherry bakewell fray bentos pies","story":"From Cherry Bakewells to Fray Bentos pies, do we really understand the cocktail of ingredients in our favourite brands? Nutritionists assess them – and just what they might mean for our healthAs the saying goes: if your granny wouldn’t have recognised what’s in it, it’s probably not real food. Yet half the food we take home is made in factories from a list of ingredients and additives as long as your arm, most of which never found a place in any grandparents’ kitchen cupboard – and wouldn’t in yours or mine today.We are a nation of ultra-processed-food eaters. Our lives have become too fast-paced to cook from scratch and our tastebuds now crave the sweet and salty flavours that ultra-processed foods deliver. Our bread is fluffy and sticks to the teeth like candyfloss. Our yoghurts are super-sweet and creamy. We have ready meals that are shelf-stable (long life without refrigeration), which we can prise open, heat, eat and go.Nutritionists are alarmed. The ultra-processed foods we tend to eat now are calorie-dense and a major contribution to obesity. They have also been stripped of bioactive compounds such as phytoestrogens and fibre, which we know are good for us. All we get is calories (and occasionally added vitamins). And although inidually they are all approved for safety, we have no idea what effect the cocktail of additives might have on us in the long term.The nutritionist Dr Courtney Scott from the Food Foundation says it costs less to fill up hungry kids on ultra-processed foods than fresh. “For £1 worth of spinach, say, you can get 60 calories. For £1 worth of apples you get 307 calories. For £1 of turkey dinosaurs, you’re getting 730 calories. It is not surprising that the foods that are palatable – they are full of salt and sugar and fat – and that are calorie-rich for a low price are the ones that we’re consuming the most of,” she says.A group of international scientists has produced what they call the Nova definition of four classes of food, from fruit and vegetables in their natural state to ultra-processed, which are, they say, “industrial formulations typically with five or more and usually many ingredients”. These include “substances not commonly used in culinary preparations”, and contain additives “whose purpose is to imitate sensory qualities” of natural foods such as fruit. They are, says Prof Carlos Monteiro from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, “intrinsically unhealthy”.His collaborator Prof Jean-Claude Moubarac, from the department of nutrition at the University of Montreal, Canada, goes further. These foods cause social and cultural damage, he says. “They promote overconsumption and a relationship to food that is characterised by compulsion, stress and anxiety.”We looked at what is actually in 10 of Britain’s favourites, choosing a top seller from 10 categories of packaged foods tracked by Euromonitor International. What is the country eating?Bernard Matthews did not respond to requests for comment.Scott says she did a double take at this list of ingredients. “Unfortunately, there is no chicken or mushroom in the chicken and mushroom sauce. There is chicken fat and there is mushroom juice concentrate,” she says. The mushroom juice concentrate will have had the fibre and vegetable micronutrients pounded out of it in the industrial process.Premier Foods, which makes Batchelors and also Mr Kipling cakes, says: “Processing plays a very important role in food safety and preservation. We recognise the importance of healthy lifestyles and balanced choices, and continually work on developing increasingly healthy and convenient options for consumers, as well as having an increased focus on positive nutrients such as fibre and protein.”Drying foods was one of the oldest preservation methods, they say. “Batchelors Pasta ’n’ Sauce is low in fat, has no added MSG and no artificial colours or preservatives.”A gold star for anyone who knows how surimi is made. It does contain Alaska pollock – but not whole slices or chunks of fish, just the protein it is fish that has been mechanically beaten and pulverised to a paste. As it is tasteless and shapeless, sugar is added, followed by a host of additives – two forms of starch and some shellfish bits and flavour enhancers – so it can be formed into a solid, fishy-tasting stick.Young’s said it would not be able to comment.There is no veg. “Fresh foods rich in bioactive compounds (flavonoids, for instance), including onions, garlic and other foods used in freshly prepared dishes are absent from these products,” says Monteiro. “Being ready-to-eat products, it is unlikely they will be consumed with fresh foods that usually need preparation. On the contrary, one ultra-processed food tends to be consumed with other ultra-processed foods.”Xanthan gum is not from an exotic tree. It is fermented sugar. The name comes from the type of bacteria used. It is a stabiliser to bind together ingredients such as fat and water that would otherwise repel each other.Fray Bentos did not respond to requests for comment.“As far as we’re concerned, the industrial loaf with all its additives isn’t actually bread,” says Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. It is calling for an Honest Crust Act to legally define “sourdough”, “artisan”, “wholegrain” and “craft”, as well as “fresh” and “freshly baked”, and to make manufacturers list all their ingredients – some are left out on the basis that they are just part of the processing.The launch of the Chorleywood Process in 1961 changed the UK’s bread drastically. This was the discovery of how to go from a pile of flour to sliced, plastic-wrapped bread in three to four hours, using lower-protein wheat, vitamin C, fat, yeast and high-speed mixers. Bread gained additives, “relaxants to overcome the stress of the machine and then tighteners again”, Young says. “It was a milestone – or tombstone – in the history of bread.”A Warburtons spokesperson says bread is one of the UK’s main sources of dietary fibre. “It is misleading to consider mass-produced bread an ‘ultra-processed food’. We bake it fresh, every day, using the same methods you would at home. However, in order to meet demand and ensure that we are able to produce affordable products for our consumers, we do this on a much larger scale.”There is lots of sugar in this, predictably – and not just sugar (twice) but glucose-fructose syrup. Dried skimmed milk will also be sweet. The digestives also contain palm oil, much used in ultra-processed foods. “Health-wise, palm oil is not fantastic because it is a highly saturated fat. It is being used instead of trans fats, which used to be commonly found in this type of product,” says Scott. “From a nutritional perspective, we’ve swapped one particularly unhealthy fat for one that isn’t particularly good for you either.” There are also concerns about the environmental impact of farming and harvesting palm oil.McVitie’s says it provides transparent information so people can make healthy snacking choices. “Biscuits are simply baked by combining a few ingredients. They are a source of fibre and adhere to strict nutrition guardrails,” it says.A spokesman from Müller says: “We are fully aligned with the view that a balanced diet and lifestyle is important, but we also believe that it should be permissible for people to enjoy moments of pleasure, which is what this product offers.”Sugar is the second ingredient here – 11g per 30g serving. From a nutritional perspective, maize and sugar are going to be very quickly digested. There is not a lot of fibre to slow the process down, so you are likely to feel hungry sooner. “In addition to it being very sweet and reinforcing that sweet palate, nutritionally this isn’t going to stay with you for very long,” says Scott.Kellogg’s says it provides a variety of convenient, nutritious and high-quality foods, all of which can play a role in a healthy, balanced diet. “Multiple studies have shown that people who start the day with a cereal breakfast tend to weigh less and have improved nutrient intakes,” says a spokesperson, pointing to the added vitamins.Ingredients: flour (with added calcium, iron, niacin, thiamin), sugar, vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed), plum and raspberry jam (glucose-fructose syrup, plum puree, sugar, raspberry puree, gelling agent (pectin), acid (citric acid), acidity regulator (sodium citrates), colour (anthocyanins), preservative (potassium sorbate), flavouring), glucose syrup, glace cherries (cherries, sugar, acidity regulator (citric acid), preservatives (potassium sorbate, sulphur dioxide), colour (cochineal), sweetened condensed skimmed milk (skimmed milk, sugar), ground rice, desiccated coconut (contains preservative (sodium metabisulphite (sulphites), whey powder (milk), dried egg white, ground almonds, salt, dextrose, emulsifiers (sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60), raising agents (disodium diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate), milk proteins, humectant (vegetable glycerine), flavouring, preservative (potassium sorbate).“There’s a bit of flour and it’s fortified – OK. A tiny, tiny bit of fruit in the form of raspberry and plum puree. This is a far cry from eating a raspberry or a plum.”Premier Foods says: “Mr Kipling Cherry Bakewells contain no hydrogenated fats, and no artificial colours or flavours.”Cadbury has MILK in capitals on the Dairy Milk ingredients list, stressing that it has plenty of real milk as well as real cocoa solids in its chocolate.

And, more importantly, because, if he’s right, Piers Morgan is wrong. Plus: why Margaret Atwood blames Star Wars for 911In ordinary circumstances, a 33-year-old man using social media to warn seven million people of a terror attack underway in central London would be regarded in generally positive terms.Unfortunately, the events of 24 November 2017 were not ordinary: the warning took the form of a tweet bellowing: “Fuck everyone get out of @Selfridges now gun shots!!”, and the 33-year-old man fearing for his life in a department store back office was noted troubadour and persistent hat apologist Olly Murs. Murs who did that quite good song with Rizzle Kicks seven years ago. Murs, the multiple Brit-eligible chap who is also cheeky, and whose place in the pantheon of modern popular culture occupies the gossamer-proportioned cavity between Robbie Williams and Bradley Walsh.Also – and, with hindsight, slightly awkwardly – it was quickly established that, despite scenes of chaos prompted, in part, by reports of gunshots, there had not been any gunshots. Within minutes Murs went from hero to berk.Very quickly, stern words about communicating mistruths to millions of people came from former News of the World editor Piers Morgan: “When you have millions of followers be very careful what you tweet.”The pair’s Twitter exchange that night also involved an “if you was there you’d have understood mate” from Murs, and a “stop tweeting … nothing happened” from Morgan. Not exactly a battle between the forces of good and evil, but certainly a battle between someone who had gone out of his way to help your nan with her shopping and, well, Piers Morgan.Maybe that’s unfair. In the same situation, Morgan, a close personal friend of Donald “I really believe I’d run in there” Trump, may well have gone “the full John Smeaton”. Morgan could quite feasibly have marched around kicking Selfridges shoppers in the knackers until he was certain any threat had been neutralised. But is it harsh, at all, to suggest that there is something slightly “wearing a frock on a Titanic lifeboat” about Morgan’s general demeanour? Something that suggests Morgan, on that highly charged November day, might, in fact, have barged his way past Olly and as many nans with shopping as he deemed necessary, in order to get into that same safe place and start tweeting?Anyway, the story eventually went quiet, save for the occasional Twitter user amusingly quote-tweeting one of Olly’s subsequent communiques — “Evacuating store now!!! Fuck heart is pounding” — during busier-than-expected weekend shopping trips. Until this week, when the Sun splashed a new interview with Olly across its front page with the headline “OLLY: I’M NO WALLY”.“Something happened that day,” he was quoted as saying. “Whether it was covered up, I don’t know.” (He also introduced the slightly odd detail that he was in the store attempting to purchase a massage chair for his aunt.) “I ran into an office,” he added, “after being told by the staff of Selfridges that someone was there with a gun.”Reporting these claims, NME’s sceptical take was: “Olly Murs has bizarrely hinted that last year’s terror attack scare at London’s Oxford Circus was a ‘cover-up’.” And so, here we are, with Murs as gunshot coverup truther: the tightest-trousered conspiracy theorist in town. The back office he legitimately thought he was going to die in has, it seems, become the hill he is prepared to die on. File this one alongside rapper BoB and his charming flat-Earther ways, or Kylie Jenner and her chemtrail theories.Except! Except. Except: what if Murs, regardless of his status as a semi-endearing bumbling pop chancer, was telling the truth? Because, you see, Lost in Showbiz has heard claims via two different Selfridges employees that suggest Murs is, in fact, not mistaken about what went down that day. And the more you think about it, and as long as you don’t think about it too hard, the more it would make sense that Murs has been pushed so hard as a lone voice in this narrative: he’s the ultimate fall guy. Quite literally – who would believe the word of a man who has fallen off stage, and on stage, and split his trousers on stage so frequently that his performance mishaps are virtually a YouTube subgenre?With this in mind, Lost in Showbiz wearily engages in what colleagues nearer the front of this esteemed journal might consider “actual journalism”.The first call is to the British Transport Police, who are routinely cited in articles, such as NME’s, debunking Murs’s version of events. They say they weren’t part of the Selfridges investigation, because they were handling Oxford Circus. A good start: get the Pulitzer committee on standby!Next stop is the Metropolitan police, who are quite helpful in terms of a prompt response, but no use whatsoever in when it comes to clearing Olly’s name (“We really could not discuss or answer a question in relation to any inidual”). Also, they repeat their earlier lines about there having not been any evidence of shots having been fired.Lost in Showbiz must concede at this stage that this whole proper journalism business is surprisingly hard work. How is it not possible to unmask a major conspiracy relating to public safety with one phone call and one query submitted via an online feedback form? No wonder reporters in films always have their ties loosened. But perhaps someone else can continue this story. Perhaps there is a courageous soul out there prepared to risk everything, like they do in those films with loosened ties, to get to the bottom of all this. Perhaps they have access to a double-berth garage capable of housing cardboard boxes full of paperwork, like the one Hank had in Breaking Bad — that was an absolutely brilliant investigation space. And perhaps they are brave enough to pursue the truth, even if it is quite possibly not true at all, while also being brave enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with a man who could at any moment burst into a passable cover of something off The Commitments soundtrack.Because, make no mistake, this isn’t about wanting Murs to be right. It’s about wanting Morgan to be wrong. A thankless pursuit, maybe, in this instance but a noble one nonetheless.In a strong week for conspiracy theories of the stars, Margaret Atwood, whose own Rizzle Kicks collaborations are sadly yet to see the light of day, has been having a chit-chat with Variety. “They got the idea from Star Wars,” she says at one point – but what could she be discussing?The Force Awakens would be the obvious answer, but no: the Handmaid’s Tale hitmaker is actually discussing 911. Notes Atwood: “Remember the first one? Two guys fly a plane in the middle of something and blow that up? The only difference is, in Star Wars, they get away.”The only difference! And there’s more right here: “Right after 911, they hired a bunch of Hollywood screenwriters to tell them how the story might go next. Sci-fi writers are very good at this stuff, anticipating future events.”Atwood’s assertion seems to represent both freedom from facts and the freedom to make up her own, apparently hinging on the notion that George Lucas invented the concept of one moving thing being capable of damaging another thing. News perhaps to anyone involved in numerous conflicts, or who used a bowling alley, before 1977. But perhaps as well as writing books that predict the future, Atwood has also found a way to rewrite the past. If that is indeed the case, there is a certain pop singer here in the UK who might appreciate some advice on how to handle 2411 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c507bb1354046ab8568890b7b3727fed8110d6e/0_596_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=12266a8b48efdf76911992ec9db35e4e 2600w","title":"manic street preachers jobs meaning jeremy corbyn doesnt understand that resistance is useless","story":"Their new album is entitled Resistance Is Futile, but the Manic Street Preachers aren’t accepting things lying down. Nicky Wire and James Dean Bradfield share their thoughts on nostalgia, Francis Bacon and why they considered splitting upNicky Wire and James Dean Bradfield are seated in the latter’s hotel room in Marylebone, central London, ostensibly promoting the Manic Street Preachers’ forthcoming 14th album, Resistance Is Futile, but instead talking about the possibility of Manic Street Preachers splitting up. Wire says he finds the prospect “terrifying”, which is understandable: they have been in the band for 31 years – they formed at secondary school in Blackwood in south Wales – and neither of them seems to know what else they might do. “I can’t go and teach at the Cardiff Institute of Music, you know,” smiles Bradfield. “My first lecture on how to make it in the music business: ‘Piss everybody off, dress like your mum and learn how to play on the job.’ ‘Er … can we have a new lecturer, please?’”Nevertheless, they say, splitting up is a thought that has occurred to both of them in the four years since they last released an album, a trying period during which Wire’s elderly parents fell ill, his mother gravely so, and their Cardiff studio, Faster, was closed after the building that housed it was earmarked for redevelopment and demolished – its closure made the local news in Wales. The process of building a new one, Bradfield protests, turned him into “a low-rent version of what’s-his-fucking-name from Grand Designs”. “He would ring me up and go: ‘I’ve got a bit of bad news – steel prices have gone up,” sighs Wire, with the unmistakable air of a man who didn’t join a band in order to discuss supporting joists.To most observers, the Manics seem to have spent the past decade in the kind of creative Indian summer that has eluded most of their peers. They enjoyed their commercial zenith in the late 90s, when, as Wire disbelievingly points out, they were so big that a single such as The Masses Against the Classes, which opens with a sample of Noam Chomsky and ends with a quotation from Albert Camus’ book The Rebel, could knock Westlife’s Seasons in the Sun off No 1. If they have never recaptured that high point, the past 10 years have still come replete with gold albums, arena tours and critical acclaim. That last record, Futurology, in particular was widely hailed as one of the best records the band has made. But Bradfield says he has found himself wondering if the Manics still had an audience – an odd thing to worry about given the size of the venues they still play, but as he says, the band were always “fucking obsessed with a desire to be huge”.“It’s dictated by role models, icons, whatever you want to call them,” Wire says. “Music used to be the leader in terms of that, everything about the way we looked growing up was about searching out how to look like those kind of people. Now they’re getting it from avenues that I can’t comprehend why they’d want to.” He sighs. “The emptiness of it. Actually, I feel a certain sense of pity, because I think our youth was so definite and tangible and exciting and full of space to dream and magic and all those kind of ephemeral things. Whereas now, it’s just ratcheted at you at such a fucking speed. And we all know, because we’ve all got kids, and you try to kind of … not influence them, but pass on things that made your life magical, and they just seem completely fucking irrelevant. It’s not nostalgia, that’s a key thing it’s actually things just disappearing. It’s like the NME closing, that was the worst thing about it: it’s just another nail, telling you music is less relevant.” Nevertheless, he says, “the one thing I know for certain, in this world of absolute doubt and uncertainty, is that when the three of us get in the studio, there is still a magic there”.Hence they didn’t split up, and while Resistance Is Futile certainly doesn’t shy away from addressing the band’s doubts – they are there in everything from its title to its cover photo, featuring “one of the last samurai warriors – someone who knows his time is over thanks to the coming of the gun” – it arrives filled with brashly anthemic songs that deal in what Wire calls “ecstatic miserablism … effervescent melancholy”.The latter’s story keys into another of Wire’s obsessions about the internet era: that nothing is ever truly secret, that everyone’s lives are constantly documented and held up to public scrutiny. “One of the greatest things Francis Bacon ever said was that you self-realised,” he says. “There was a period of five years in his life, literally no one knows what the fuck he did. He destroyed everything he painted, there were rumours he was an interior decorator, he was in Berlin … Just no one knows what went on for that period, and that can never happen again, that self-realisation where you really form yourself through isolation and scarcity and ideas. I actually feel sorry for the generations coming after us, because of that. How can you do it? Everything is there, laid out for you to be embarrassed by when you’re older, without realising. All our embarrassing songs that we wrote when we were 15, you know, thank fuck no one heard them. So there’s humiliation, as well, that idea of one false step … If you look back at me and Richey at the start, fuck me, we’d have been killed today. I dread to think what I would have put James and Sean through, because some of the interviews are just … there’s so much talk, and it’s only by the end that we talk any sense. But that was the process, wasn’t it, of just going through all that stuff.”There is also a considerable amount of fretting about politics, which seems faintly surprising: given the band’s past political allegiances to Tony Benn and Arthur Scargill, I had assumed they would be quite gung-ho for Jeremy Corbyn, but apparently not. “I’m coming around to him a lot more, but not gung-ho, no,” says Bradfield. “I’m not one of those people that goes on about the liberal elite in London, but I don’t think he understands what makes the working classes tick outside of London and that is just hardcore industries. We’ve operated at our optimum as people when jobs give us meaning, and in the post-industrial hinterlands, he doesn’t understand that. I remember somebody at a meeting down in south Wales, an old guy, ex-miner, wanted his son to have a proper, real, blue-collar job, and he was saying: ‘What do you expect us to do, Mr Corbyn, make fucking love spoons out of hemp?’ I don’t think Jezza gets it, I don’t think he connects with people on that level, which is part of the reason we’re having political problems in Wales.”Wire says he’s “completely baffled by my own political vacuum” since Brexit: “A lot of it’s just about political intelligence, the frustration where I think we grew up in a time when there was a lot of political intelligence on both sides, to be honest. Now … there’s never any answers, it’s just statement after statement of opposing vitriol, you know, which I just … I just can’t see a middle way at the moment.”And Bradfield and Wire go off on a lengthy tangent about politics: they talk, as much to each other as to me, about Tony Benn’s notion of the EU as “a gentleman’s club for millionaires” and how the remain campaign failed because it didn’t make enough of the EU’s failings and the need to reform it, whether or not the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is “an old-school totalitarian communist” (this, I should point out, is a phrase Wire uses with approval, rather than censure), and the proposed 2016 closure of the Tata steelworks in Port Talbot. They don’t, it has to be said, sound much like an irrelevant band stuck for things to say.“There is a sense of a massive fun and excitement being in our band,” says Wire. “Every record we’ve made recently, whether you like them or not, they’ve all been convincing. It’s still full of vitality. You can’t really fake that. We have to be completely committed to this.” He smiles. “At our age, if you’re not, then it’s fucking over.”Resistance is Futile is released on Columbia on 13 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff605447fbb9b61f502c47b8273ae0a743d8d72/0_0_4000_2655/master/4000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bfdede032830d9f52e69dbc62a8a452 700w","title":"scientists solve mystery of how giants causeway was formed","story":"Volcanologists use samples from Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland to recreate famous hexagonal columns in laboratoryAccording to legend, the Giant’s Causeway was built by the Irish giant, Finn MacCool, as a crossing to confront his Scottish rival. Scientists have an alternative explanation, and for the first time they have reproduced in the laboratory the process through which the causeway’s 40,000 near-perfect hexagonal columns were formed.Geometric columns are seen in a variety of volcanic rocks across the Earth and are known to form as the rock cools and contracts, resulting in a regular array of polygonal prisms or columns. But until now, geologists had been unsure of the threshold at which cooling magma suddenly fractures into a geometric pavement.To answer the question, Lavallée and colleagues recreated the process in the laboratory using basalt cores drilled from the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. The 20cm-long cylinders, gripped by a clamp at each end, were heated to more than 1,000C until they began to soften into lava. The samples were fixed at each end in a mechanical grip and cooled to test at what point they snapped.The basalt magma fractured at between 840-890C, the study found, suggesting that this is the temperature at which the Giant’s Causeway would have formed.“I have spent over a decade pondering how to address this question and construct the right experiment to find the answer to this question,” said Lavallée. “Now, with this study, we have found that the answer is hot, but after it solidified.”In the future, he hopes to extend the investigation by using a large pool of magma to reproduce the geometric fracturing as rock is cooled – although he said such an experiment would need to be performed under carefully controlled conditions.The Giant’s Causeway formed between 50 and 60 million years ago, when the region that now sits on the Antrim coastline was subject to intense volcanic activity. Molten basalt erupted through chalk beds and formed a lake of lava. As this cooled and contracted, cracks propagated across the plateau to form hexagonal stepping stones. Similar geological structures are seen elsewhere in the world, including Devils Postpile in the US, and the pattern occurs on many scales because faster cooling produces smaller columns.The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fb8605654042a1ebe82f9254ef041b3832a78d/0_258_3870_2322/master/3870.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=234c4b0fad951fe4df4084dda213cb65 1240w","title":"colin kaepernick seahawks workout postponed","story":"The Seattle Seahawks were all set to work out former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick earlier this week, but rescinded the invitation after he wouldn’t say whether he plans to continue kneeling in protest during the national anthem, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.The team wasn’t so much concerned with Kaepernick’s position as it was that he didn’t seem to have a firm plan for his future, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.“On Colin Kaepernick and #Seahawks: From a team perspective, they wanted to hear Kaepernick’s plan going forward, including but not limited to kneeling. There is also the lawsuit, for instance... From those close to Kaepernick, they maintain it was only, Will you keep kneeling?,” read one Rapoport tweet.“#Seahawks brass, John Schneider and Pete Carroll, want Colin Kaepernick to consider how he wants to proceed on everything (not just anthem) and get together at a later date when his plans are formed. Clearly, Seattle has accepted players speaking out for what they believe,” read another.Kaepernick has a pending lawsuit alleging collusion by the league office, owners and teams to keep him out of the NFL. He was deposed by the NFL’s lawyers in that lawsuit on Tuesday. Kaepernick began his pregame protest following excessive force cases involving police. He first sat during the anthem in the 2016 season and then knelt. Eventually he was joined by his San Francisco 49ers teammates, including safety Eric Reid, and players on other teams followed suit. Kaepernick, who hasn’t played since 1 January 2017, also has 2,300 career rushing yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground. He hasn’t had a workout with any NFL teams since becoming a free agent. Kaepernick, 30, met with Seattle during free-agency last offseason, but the team opted instead to sign Austin Davis to back up Russell Wilson. Davis, who was on a one-year deal, is now a free agent and the team also recently released Trevone Boykin, leaving them with zero options behind Wilson at the moment. Three NFL owners are on the deposition list for Kaepernick’s lawsuit: Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots and Bob McNair of the Houston Texans. McNair was infamously quoted in an ESPN report as suggesting the league should crack down on protests because “we can’t have the inmates running the prison”.Head coaches John Harbaugh of the Ravens and the team’s general manager, Ozzie Newsome, are also on the request list from Kaepernick’s attorneys. The same goes for the Seahawks’ braintrust of coach Pete Carroll and GM John Schneider and NFL executives Troy Vincent and Arthur McAfee.

With three rounds left both the Sharks and Newcastle are strong contenders for Europe’s Champions Cup qualification with a top-four spot hinging on the outcome of Friday ’s shoot-out at Kingston Park.The two clubs are separated by only one point in fifth and sixth positions, with the winners set to jump into third. Wasps and Leicester will not be easily denied play-off places but fifth-placed Newcastle, with two of their last three games at home plus a trip to face the Tigers, can still shape their own destiny.Sale will have to dig even deeper, with a long hike to Exeter and a final home fixture against Leicester rounding off a tricky run-in, but their confidence has been given a timely lift by last week’s dramatic win over Wasps. Trailing 17-0 in the first half they came back to win 28-27 courtesy of Marland Yarde’s last-second try.According to their captain, Jono Ross, the trick now is to reproduce their dominant home form on the road. This season they have won away against only the bottom three teams in the league and will need to find an extra gear to outwit the Falcons and the Chiefs. “We think we’re a good side but we haven’t been as good as we’ve wanted to away from home,” Ross said. “We need to replicate the performances we’ve put in at the AJ Bell. Hopefully that will be enough.”A big finish would also improve Ross’s chances of a place on England’s tour to his native South Africa. The Johannesburg-born back-row forward is qualified for England via a grandmother from Essex and Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, said Eddie Jones and England’s forwards coach, Steve Borthwick, have been making inquiries.Exeter (already qualified for play-offs) L Irish (a), Sale (h), Harlequins (a)Ross, who had stints as a young player with Harlequins, Saracens and the Bulls in South Africa, spent three years playing alongside Sergio Parisse for Stade Français before joining Sale last summer and has become an influential figure for the Sharks, assuming the captaincy after an injury to Will Addison. “For me it’s about performing well for Sale week-in week-out. I don’t want to think about things that are out of my control. I’ve had no conversations with Eddie but every player has international aspirations.”The 27-year-old is clearly resilient, having featured in every league game this season, and has been pleasantly surprised by life in the Premiership compared with the slower-paced Top 14. “The speed of the game and the conditioning are quite different to what I experienced in France. It’s more similar to back home in South Africa. There are also a fantastic group of people here. We care about each other and I think that shows.”For the Newcastle game Paolo Odogwu and Luke James start at left wing and inside-centre respectively, with the tighthead prop WillGriff John returning to the front row and Byron McGuigan named at full-back. The 18-year-old Cameron Redpath, the English-qualified son of the former Scotland international Bryan, is poised to make his Premiership debut off the bench.Newcastle’s lineup features Gary Graham, who is back after injuring his neck at England training in early February, with Joel Hodgson, the league’s most accurate goalkicker this season, chosen ahead of Toby Flood at fly-half. “For us it’s a must-win game in terms of keeping our top-four hopes alive,” said Dean Richards, the Falcons’ director of rugby. “If we don’t win we can almost kiss the semi-finals goodbye.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7405c5fc9466c0be80616b4a13277117ee5fede2/0_86_4445_2668/master/4445.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8283cbb09cfd5158ef310e199f5b3c94 2600w","title":"grand national 2018 a horse by horse betting guide","story":"We go through the 40 runners for the 2018 edition of the world’s most famous horse raceLong had a big reputation but one win from 13 runs over fences is disappointing. Worth remembering, in light of Native River’s Gold Cup win, that Minella Rocco beat that one at the previous two Festivals, including when he won the four-miler as a six-year-old. A big, strong stayer, he can have a lumbering look over his fences and might not be best suited by having to navigate the Canal Turn among rivals. Like many others from his stable, he has not been at his best this winter. Carries more weight than any National winner since 1974. Looked the likely winner when going clear after the third-last a year ago but was on fumes by the final fence and faded into fourth. More conservative tactics might help but he’s 9lb higher and carries 12lb more in absolute terms. Romped to glory in the Becher, showing how well he goes round here, but the extra weight he got for that did not help at Haydock in February, where he couldn’t go with the easy winner and finished tired. Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Couldn’t finish quite as strongly as a classy rival when second in the 2016 National. Shot up the ratings, has not won since and is still 10lb higher than that day. Faded into a well-beaten 16th last year and something similar seems likely. Admirably consistent but in need of luck.Wasn’t far off the best when with Willie Mullins, for whom he won two Grade Ones as a novice. May well have won the 2016 Irish Gold Cup, but for unseating at the last. Missed a year and four runs since his comeback seem to show him in decline. Still high in the weights, just 5lb below his peak, and would need something like his best to get involved here. Stamina must also be taken on trust, as he’s never raced beyond three miles and a furlong.Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Not far short of the best as a staying hurdler and useful over fences but is rated to the hilt of his ability. Ran a fair race to be eighth in last year’s Irish National, when he was hampered by a faller, and beaten only by Total Recall in the Munster National, trying to give him lumps of weight. Not usually a strong finisher and has broken blood vessels at times.Cheltenham specialist who has run many fine races there but not usually to the same level elsewhere. Pulled up at the fourth-last a year ago and only 2lb lower in the weights this time but trainer says he had an interrupted preparation then. A sound jumper and solid stayer with no secrets from the handicapper and likely to be outpaced by something if still in contention after the last.Would have an extra 4lb to carry if the weights had not been set in February, since when he ran a fine second at the Cheltenham Festival, finishing strongly to be beaten by a neck. Promising teenage jockey who rode that day will be aboard again. Pulled up four fences from home last year but was only seven and entitled to do better now. Hasn’t won since but several efforts have suggested he is ready for this marathon trip. Slight concern that his Cheltenham form is so much better than elsewhere.A front-runner when things go well, he never got involved last year and finished 17th. In common with most of his stablemates, has been well below his best this year but the yard is now getting winners. Wins over fences have come in small fields, which does not augur well here. It’s more than five years since he won at a track where the bends go to the left.Irish Gold Cup winner of 2015 and 2016, this veteran has dropped a stone from his peak rating in the past year and is now on a weight that would make him dangerous if he returned to something like his best. Has shown little in four runs this season but all came before New Year, when he has not traditionally been at his best. Interesting.Winner of the last two Scottish Grand Nationals, proving that big-field marathon handicaps on flat, left-handed tracks in the spring are his thing. That makes him of obvious interest, though he’s no certainty to get round. He fell at the first a year ago, one of three times in his last nine starts he’s managed to get rid of his jockey. A big run is possible if he avoids such disasters.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.Ran on in eye-catching style to be eighth last year, having seemingly been given too much to do. Put up another fine effort when third in the Ladbrokes Trophy in December and warmed up for this by scoring at Ascot in February. Has taken years to build on his early promise but finally doing so and has it in him to land a major prize. Still on a fair weight and 4lb well in, as his Ascot win came after the weights were set.Hoping it can be third time lucky but the limitations of his stamina seemed to be exposed by the last two Nationals. Has had a poor season, failing to finish within 12 lengths of a winner, but is slightly higher in the ratings than for his previous two attempts, which hardly seems fair. Comes from a stable having a poor run.Muddy marathons are the thing for this winner of last year’s Midlands National. On drier ground or against classy opposition, he generally gets left behind. Having won at Haydock in November, he went up 10lb and has struggled in two subsequent runs, suggesting he lacks the necessary quality unless it rains plenty. A dogged galloper, he goes well at Newbury and should therefore be suited by this circuit. Looked as though he was reaching the limits of his stamina when headed close home in the Great Yorkshire Chase, over a mile shorter than this. Up against it, on a rating 12lb higher than when he last won.Third in the Scottish National two years ago, though his jumping was scrappy at times and his stamina gave out about a furlong from the line. Has had a wind operation. Because of injuries, his decent third in a much shorter race last month was his first run over fences for 16 months, which is not ideal preparation. Nicely weighted on the pick of his form, including a defeat of Blaklion at Cheltenham two years ago. Jumped the last with the leaders last year but had nothing left and tired into fifth, having taken a shoulder-barge from the runner-up at the second-last. Fell at the first in 2015 but usually does well over these fences, having won here in December. Has held his form so well that he is now rated higher than ever, 4lb higher than for last year’s race. Another respectable showing is likely.Career best in January when running away with the Peter Marsh, pulling 13 lengths clear of Captain Redbeard. Was fired up the ratings to a mark 9lb higher than he’s ever been and may struggle to compete until he drops back down. He was carrying less weight that day than four other finishers of moderate talent, whereas here he will mix with Festival winners on a similar weight. Stopped quickly and was found to have bled from the nose when pulled up at Haydock in February.Given every chance last year by a masterful Ruby Walsh ride, creeping smoothly into contention on the second circuit before getting tired from the third-last and finishing ninth. Jumped soundly but stumbled and nearly unseated on landing over second Valentine’s, which can’t have helped. Only 1lb lower, despite modest efforts on both starts this season, and won’t have Walsh’s help. This plodder must be one of the few horses to spend three years in Gordon Elliott’s yard without winning. Often runs well, however, and has twice been placed in the Thyestes and also in Leopardstown’s Paddy Power Chase. Was a distant sixth in this race two years ago after notable mistakes. Went well last year until a rival jumped across him at Becher’s, causing his rider to fall off. Generally a sound jumper but will surely find something too quick for him on the run-in, even if his stamina holds up.Fine record at Aintree in April stretches back to 2011, when he won a Grade One novice hurdle. Won a handicap chase the next year and has since been second and third in the National, from four attempts. Soft ground is no use, as he showed when pulled up in 2016. Gets to run off the same rating as when third last year but we can’t be sure he retains his ability aged 12. He’s had just two runs this season and predictably failed to cope with soggy ground both times. Stable has been quiet for a month or two.Record of steady progress over the years and showed his best form with three consecutive wins last spring and summer, battling to win the City of Perth Gold Cup on the line. Only 4lb higher for that, though this represents an enormous step up in quality. Best form has been on a dry surface and he won’t get that. Likely to show up well for a long way before fading.Stormed clear in the Welsh Grand National and would have done the same the previous season if he hadn’t bumped into a future Gold Cup winner in Native River. Is also a winner of the Munster National and two Cork Nationals, giving him an excellent record in big-field marathons. Gone up another 6lb to match the highest rating he’s ever had and Chepstow form does not always translate well to Aintree. He’s a hold-up horse who will therefore need luck, which he didn’t get last year, when he unseated his jockey while dodging a faller. Would be the oldest winner for 95 years but clearly is not in decline. Very dangerous if able to get into contention by the third-last.Entered the reckoning with an authoritative success in the North Yorkshire Grand National, when he made all the running. Went up a stone in the weights, which is a lot for beating five finishers who have done little for the form. That might have been his big day, in a race the trainer was winning for the third year in a row, at a course where this horse is unbeaten. But he copes well with a stamina test and could have more to offer.Has a good record round Aintree’s Mildmay course, which may not translate to the much bigger National course and fences. Disappointing when eighth there in November and had a wind operation the next month. Unraced since mid-December, an unorthodox National preparation. Likes a dry-ish surface, so could do without much rain. Fairly weighted and could get involved if everything falls right but more likely to be seeking softer targets.Tough, staying mare who is still young enough to have her best days ahead of her, being younger than any National winner since 1940. Never got into it when sixth in the 2016 Irish National and could only find the one pace when fifth in the Welsh National that year. Last seen running a fair third in Punchestown’s National Trial, giving weight to the first two, who made that form look good in the Irish National. She’s in big trouble if a turn of foot is required but, granted soft ground, she could get a lot of these in trouble by grinding along relentlessly in front.Went into a lot of notebooks as a National type when bolting up by 12 lengths in a race on the Mildmay course here two years ago, but then had to miss last year’s National after a badly timed injury. Hard to say how much ability he retains, as he’s been raced so sparingly and often over hurdles but it’s a concern that he is now older than any National winner since 1923. Leap of faith required.Stamina is the most obvious weak spot for this talented but frustrating type who appears not to be the most robust. Beaten over 100 lengths into 13th two years ago, eased down on the run-in on soft ground. Has only had two runs since, when a fine second in last year’s Kim Muir and when well beaten in the same race this year. Ground made the difference it was good when he was second, very testing when he flopped. Hard to believe he’s a National winner in waiting. Famously frustrating beast who has finished fast but too late on many a day, often after killing his chance with a mistake. Has been held back by metal pins in a back leg but the trainer says he’s moving better than ever and won a decent pot at Sandown in January. Offsetting that he ran so poorly when 12th in the 2016 National on soft ground, which should have suited, and after a much stronger season than this one.One of the least experienced in the field after just four runs over fences, of which his only win came in a 2016 beginners’ chase. Background and pedigree suggest his stamina might not stretch to a race like this and he was pulled up on his only attempt in a long-distance handicap chase. Doesn’t seem to like big fields. Rating looks a bit high. Hard to fancy.Ruined his chance last year by boiling over before the start. Did pretty well, then, to work his way into contention by the second-last but was a tired seventh in the end. Fell on his only outing since, when heavy ground did not suit. If the weather dries up and he behaves himself, it’s not beyond him to get involved off a rating that has dropped a stone and a half from his peak. He was a dual Festival winner but four years is a long time to make your supporters wait for another victory.Game and consistent, he’s already had an excellent season, winning the Tommy Whittle in December and chasing home The Dutchman in the Peter Marsh back at Haydock. Warmed up with a first hurdles success for two years. Still on a beatable rating in the right contest but this might not be it. There’s a lot more strength in depth than he’s used to meeting and all his wins have come in single-figure fields. Not the most efficient jumper, mixing flamboyant leaps with the odd mistake. He didn’t have much left at the end of his last two races.Thoroughly experienced plodder after 38 starts over fences. By no means a prolific winner in recent seasons, though he managed to nick a weak race at Sandown in November. Got round in his own time to be 10th last year, beaten by 42 lengths. Could do better if the ground is soft. Blinkers may have helped when he was third at Ascot last month and could do so again. A distant third in the Welsh National last season and has since dropped 9lb, while his stable has finally hit form after a bleak winter, so a case can be made for him plugging on into fifth, maybe.Veteran of 46 races over fences showed his wellbeing by winning round Cheltenham’s cross-country course in December. Has twice been second in the Irish National and was beaten just a short-head in 2016 under Ruby Walsh. Now 6lb higher than when second at Fairyhouse last year. Jumping has never been flawless but a clear round could easily put him in the leading bunch on the run from the third-last. Doubtful he can be fastest from there. Could do with the ground drying up.Gave a mulish display when dropping himself out in the Welsh National and was then remarkably revived by the fitting of blinkers when an easy winner of Warwick’s Classic Chase. A change of jockey may also have helped. Believing he would miss the cut for this, connections raced him in two more marathons on heavy going in the past two months, including a fair second in the Midlands National. Will have to be remarkably robust to show his best form here at the end of such a taxing season.Close second in the Badger Ales on his first run of the season but went up a few pounds and has not really shone in stronger races since. Travelled strongly in the Welsh National and Kim Muir before the limitations of his stamina appeared to be shown up in both. Was running a fair race just behind the leaders when his saddle slipped at the second Canal Turn two years ago, causing him to be pulled up. Now 7lb lower and capable of going well again, though his form this season has been patchy. Was giving lumps of weight to the first three when fourth at Chepstow in October and plugged on gamely to be fourth in the Kim Muir last month. Stamina must be in question, given he got tired and faded in the Hennessy for the last two years.Career peaked with an extremely game effort to be third in an attritional Cheltenham Gold Cup three years ago, when quality rivals like Many Clouds, Silviniaco Conti and Carlingford Lough were a long way behind. Ran to a high level for another season after that and was second in the 2016 Irish Gold Cup but has been two stones below his best in the last year. Enthusiasm seems to be on the wane, despite various bits of headgear being tried. On a dangerously low rating if he ever does bounce back to something like his best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40e539b868dbdaefe00c6c38a41245403676c79e/0_0_4990_3327/master/4990.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43cf334d808ffec5c2fab1c842bf112a 700w","title":"instagram users download own data portability tool","story":"New portability tool will allow users to extract copy of own content posted on social networkInstagram has confirmed it will let users download their personal data, including previously shared photos, videos and messages, as it prepares for the European data regulation GDPR.While its parent company, Facebook, had announced a suite of GDPR controls, which Mark Zuckerberg emphasised during his testimony to Congress this week, Instagram had been quiet on the issue.GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) brings with it a number of rights for iniduals, including to demand deletion of data, to opt out of future data collection, and to view the personal data a company possesses and to download it in a format that can be moved over to competitors.These were the requirements Instagram would fulfil shortly, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. “We are building a new data portability tool,” a spokesperson said. “You’ll soon be able to download a copy of what you’ve shared on Instagram, including your photos, videos and messages.”The tool will be helpful for users who want to extract what they have uploaded to Instagram. Treasured photos and videos can sometimes get lost in their original form, but currently there are few ways to easily access the high-resolution originals if they have been posted on the social network. It is unclear whether the company will also include details of a user’s advertising profiling in its data download. The wealth of information included in Facebook’s equivalent service shocked some users, who were unhappy to discover that the company had tracked metadata of their text and phone conversations.GDPR comes into effect on 25 May, which means the coming month will probably include a flurry of announcements similar to Instagram’s. Many large tech companies, including Google, have yet to confirm whether they are altering their products to comply with the regulation.According to EUObserver, the European commission intends to police that deadline according to the date of disclosure, not the date of the underlying breach. This means any company that has been withholding knowledge of a successful hack will need to disclose that fact sooner rather than later, or risk a hefty penalty."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Now, with Elon Musk talking about getting his Mars colony up and running by 2040, this Netflix reboot doesn’t require such a giant leap of the imagination.I’m (just) too young for Lost in Space 1.0, but I found the first episode. Wow, it looks like the TV equivalent of cave painting. It’s atmospheric, with great John Williams music, but the robot looks like it was made from cardboard boxes and bits of plumbing equipment. The medium has travelled light years in half a century.There is nothing cardboard about the new one – a serious Netflix budget sees to that. The Robinsons, no longer the perfect nuclear 1960s family, have gained some 21st-century attitude and dysfunction. The parents aren’t really together the kids have modern anxieties and mardiness. On the way to establish a new colony, they crash on a planet that looks like Canada but with even more extreme geography, weather and fauna. The opener is packed with nail-biting action and literal cliffhangers. Matriarch Maureen (Molly Parker) has broken her leg, Judy is trapped under the ice, time is running out, Will falls down a crevasse into a scary forest where he meets his robot (less plumbing, more CGI, same utterance: “Danger, Will Robinson”).The scene-setting continues over the next few episodes, with flashbacks to fill in the holes in space and time, and the introduction of other survivors, including wicked stowaway Dr Smith (Parker Posey – Dr Smith is now a woman). After that, it can settle into an orbit of family adventures.It looks great. I love the new Chariot. And it’s not unfun. But nor does it boldly go where no sci-fi show has gone before. Some of the characterisation is crude. Doc Smith, for example, is a two-dimensional comedy baddie rather than a proper villain to have nightmares about. The parents’ marital issues are touched on rather than explored. The kids are annoying, although, well, they’re kids, they’re allowed to be. But it’s all a bit shallow. I don’t feel myself getting lost in it.And if you put it next to a certain other family sci-fi programme that also began in the 60s and was reborn in the 21st century, and which also has a doctor – the Doctor – who recently regenerated as a woman, it lacks wit and warmth and wizardry.A missed opportunity then. But perhaps it’s also reassuring – not that there’s life out there, but that, when it comes to television drama, money isn’t everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d1badc1019befe45677c71d4354d08a41ca3214/0_29_2520_1511/master/2520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d8ba9a6fa8b28b542c958ea02714c135 1240w","title":"rafael caro quintero fbi most wanted mexico","story":"Rafael Caro Quintero served 28 years in Mexico for killing of Enrique ‘Kike’ Camarena but was released on a technicality in 2017A veteran drug kingpin convicted over the murder of a DEA agent and then released on a technicality from a Mexican prison has been added to the FBI’s list of its 10 most-wanted fugitives.Rafael Caro Quintero now faces additional criminal charges unsealed in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, and the US government increased the reward for his capture to $20m. Caro Quintero was convicted of ordering the 1985 murder of Enrique “Kike” Camarena, a DEA special agent, and served 28 years in a Mexican prison before being released on a technicality in 2013. His release prompted outrage in the US, and a new Mexican arrest warrant was issued less than a week later. Law enforcement agencies have warned that he is still an active member of the Sinaloa cartel. “We need the public’s help in finding this violent fugitive,” the acting FBI deputy director, David Bowdich, said on Thursday as he announced Caro Quintero’s inclusion on the most-wanted list. “We believe he is still in Mexico.”Several years ago, in an interview with the Mexican magazine Proceso, Caro Quintero denied murdering Camarena.Bowdich said the most-wanted list was “one of our most valuable tools” and that 484 of the 518 fugitives who have been on the list have been captured.Also on Thursday, federal officials unsealed an additional indictment against Caro Quintero, accusing him of trafficking in methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine and marijuana from 1980 until 2017.Caro Quintero has controlled the Sinaloa cartel along with Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García since the arrest of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.Authorities say it is the first time that a suspect sought by the DEA has been added to the FBI’s list.The DEA and FBI’s renewed push to track down Caro Quintero comes at a time when the justice department under the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is prioritizing enforcement against violent crimes and drug trafficking. Recently, Sessions urged federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in drug cases when it was appropriate under law to do so.The effort to arrest Caro Quintero comes a few months before “El Chapo” is slated to go on trial in September for his leadership role in the Sinaloa cartel.

Danius said she had lost the confidence of the academy, but would not comment on whether a vote was held to remove her. “It is the academy’s wish that I leave my post as permanent secretary,” said Danius, a 56-year-old Swedish literature historian, and the first woman to hold the position. “I would have liked to have continued, but there are other things to do in life.” Three members of the academy withdrew last week over the issue, but arcane rules that make appointments for life mean that members cannot technically resign, though they stop participating in activities.  The public row and defections from the academy have raised concerns that the image of the Nobel prizes and Sweden’s reputation abroad could suffer. “It has already affected the Nobel prize quite severely and that is quite a big problem,” Danius said. On Wednesday, the Nobel Foundation board sharply criticized the Swedish Academy, saying the group was threatening to tarnish the reputation of the Nobel prize.The resignations come after the daily Dagens Nyheter in November published statements from 18 women who said they had been subject to harassment and physical abuse by the accused man. The academy has since severed all ties with him and cut grants made to him. It has also launched an internal investigation and enlisted the services of a law firm.The academy, which in under the direct patronage of the Norwegian king, is traditionally very discreet and has been deeply shaken by the scandal. Of the 18 elders of the academy, seven are no longer active members, and two women have gone on leave for several years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca37006bf3b401a653ced0dd0dabd0cfedddbf53/0_191_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8f32740eb52c6722b4b0678477e8e9ad 1240w","title":"syria deconfliction hotline in use by russia and us says kremlin","story":"James Mattis says he is still seeking evidence in chemical weapons attack while France says Bashar al-Assad government is responsibleJames Mattis, the US defense secretary, has said Washington is still looking for evidence on who carried out Saturday’s chemical weapons attack in Damascus and that his main concern about a military response was how to stop it “escalating out of control”.Donald Trump consulted his top national security advisers on a US response but the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said on Thursday “no final decision has been taken”. In a phone call with the British prime minister, Theresa May, a few hours later, the two leaders agreed that “it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged”.French president Emmanuel Macron said that his government had “proof” that the government of Bashar al-Assad was responsible for the attack, which is reported to have killed about 50 people and affected hundreds more. NBC and CNN quoted US officials as saying that blood and urine samples from the victims of Saturday’s attack showed traces of chlorine and a nerve agent, and that US intelligence had other evidence pointing to the regime’s culpability, which would be presented to the president.But Mattis’s cautious tone on Thursday echoed a morning tweet by Donald Trump that appeared to walk back his threat of imminent action 24 hours earlier.On Wednesday, the president tweeted that US missiles “will be coming” and told Russia, which has forces in Syria, to “get ready”. But the next morning, Trump tweeted that he “never said when an attack on Syria would take place”. An attack, the president said “could be very soon or not so soon at all!”Analysts said the more measured tone suggested that the US and allies were prepared to take longer to ready a more comprehensive attack than the US missile salvo launched last April after a previous poison gas attack, while building pressure on Russia to rein in the regime’s worst atrocities and accept Assad’s departure as part of a Syrian political settlement.At the UN, the Russian envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, said Russia’s “immediate priority is to avert the danger of war”.Asked if he was referring to a war between the United States and Russia, Nebenzia told reporters: “We cannot exclude any possibilities unfortunately because we saw messages that are coming from Washington. They were very bellicose.”Nebenzia added: “The danger of escalation is higher than simply Syria because our military are there. So the situation is very dangerous.”In testimony to the House armed services committee, Mattis voiced similar concerns. “My strategic concern is how do we keep this from escalating out of control, if you get my drift,” he told members of Congress. Mattis said he believed chemical weapons had been used, but “we are looking for evidence” on who was responsible. Trump has blamed Assad and Russia for backing him.Macron, who has repeatedly insisted that proven use of chemical weapons in Syria was a “red line” for France, said on Thursday that his government would decide its response “in due course”.“We have the proof that last week chemical weapons were used – at least chlorine – and that they were used by the Assad regime,” Macron told a TV interviewer.The French president said one of his aims in Syria was to “remove the regime’s chemical attack capabilities” once all information had been checked. He he added: “France will in no way allow an escalation or anything that would harm regional stability, but we cannot allow regimes that believe they can act with impunity to violate international law in the worst possible way.”In London, the cabinet emerged from a discussion on Syria, and put out a statement saying it had agreed “that the Assad regime has a track record of the use of chemical weapons and it is highly likely that the regime is responsible for Saturday’s attack”.“Cabinet agreed on the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress and to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime,” the statement from Downing Street said.Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) were due to arrive in Damascus on Thursday, but they are not due to visit the site of the attack – until Saturday.Mattis said repeatedly he believed use of chemical weapons was “inexcusable” and required a forceful response. In theory there are three alternative responses - the first a punitive strike such as the US attack on the Shayrat air base in April 2017 that saw 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles hit the the air base in response to a chemical weapons attack.The second level of attack is to seek to prevent Syria attempting to use chemical weapons again by destroying the relevant facilities, the means of delivery and imposing a punishment.The third level of activity is to seek to weaken the entire Assad military infrastructure or even attack Assad\u0027s presidential palace, as well as Syrian military headquarters.\u0026nbspBut there is no appetite in Western capitals to forcibly dislodge Assad from office, even if there may be an unspoken wish to change the way the Syrian government negotiates at UN peace talks in Geneva.The Kremlin said on Thursday that Russia and the US were currently using a “deconfliction” telephone line for Syria.Mike Pompeo, the CIA director and Trump’s pick for secretary of state, appeared to affirm at his confirmation hearing reports that about 200 Russian mercenaries were killed in a February clash with US-led forces in Syria. The deconfliction line between the US and Russian militaries was used during that incident.Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, says that the US and its allies appeared to be preparing a more comprehensive assault on the sinews of Assad powers than the single Tomahawk missile barrage against a Syrian airbase last year.“If you are going to conduct a campaign that goes beyond the strike in April, you need to plan out who does what,” Heras said. “What are the range of targets and who is responsible for putting a bomb on them? If they are going to do saturation strikes, they have to go after the air defences so that planes can come in to do really specific targeting.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Irish TimesIreland’s insistence that the Brexit treaty includes a backstop to preserve the island’s open border enjoys the full support of Germany, the German foreign minister has insisted.Heiko Maas, the new federal German foreign minister, made the pledge as he met Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney in Dublin.The discussions happened ahead of Mr Maas’s scheduled meeting with British foreign secretary Boris Johnston.Mr Maas said Germans understood the emotional sensitivities around the Border, given his country’s own experience of ision. “I do understand the need that we do whatever we can in order to avoid a flaring up of a historic conflict,” he said.“We have to do everything we can to avoid the glimmer of seeing something like a hard border become reality.”Mr Coveney said the solidarity shown by Germany was “very, very reassuring”.“We have got unambiguous solidarity today from the largest country in the European Union, and that is hugely appreciated on the Irish Border issue,” he said.“I think the Germans do understand actually the significance of borders and barriers and the emotions that get stirred up by that type of imagery.”He added: “The idea that anybody could be talking about the re-emergence of physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland is something that we simply can’t allow to go unchallenged or unchecked.”Mr Coveney reiterated his view that the backstop agreement struck between the UK and the EU in December, which would see Northern Ireland align with much of the EU’s regulatory framework, was only a “fall-back” position and that the preferred option was for both parties to agree a wide-ranging post-Brexit trading agreement.But he warned: “There will be no withdrawal treaty if there is not a backstop on Irish Border in that treaty.”“We believe that to be a question with regard to which Great Britain has to take a decision.” – Press AssociationNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3458513.1523469092!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government looks to push closer german ties ahead of brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman foreign minister Heiko Maas (above left) will travel to Dublin on Thursday to meet Tánaiste Simon Coveney, while German  finance minister Olaf Scholz (above centre) and his Irish counterpart Paschal Donohoe will meet in Berlin. Photograph: Fabrizio BenschReutersMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will today unveil proposals for closer Irish-German ties when Germany’s new foreign minister, Heiko Maas, visits Dublin.The plan is expected to involve a new consulate in Frankfurt, a joint Irish-German economic council, closer political and ministerial exchanges and a greater arts push co-ordinated by a new cultural director in Berlin.The Irish Embassy in Berlin has since December been consulting on proposals to boost Ireland’s profile in Germany ahead of Brexit and next year’s 90th anniversary of the first Irish diplomatic mission to the country. Germany is not just first among equals in the EU: it is Ireland’s second-largest source of inward investment, third-largest source of foreign guests, fourth-largest trading partner and fifth largest food export market.Bedded down in the Government’s wider plan to double Ireland’s global footprint by 2025, proposals raised during German consultations include an award recognising people who contribute to Irish-German relations and greater outreach to emigrant Irish families and second- and third-generation Irish.The Department of Foreign Affairs plan is an attempt to adapt to new post-Brexit realities but also to catch up with Irish people voting with their feet. In the six years to 2016, the Irish community in Germany grew by 40 per cent to 14,000 and continues to expand.The plan is likely to make clear that a reboot of Irish relations must engage closely with Angela Merkel’s federal government but also with the decentralised Germany beyond Berlin: 16 federal states, many with populations and economies dwarfing most EU members, which have huge autonomy in everything from investment to education policy.It is expected to propose regular German visits by Irish officials to co-ordinate bilateral and EU policy.Closer ties will hinge on Irish officials identifying and implementing useful projects with Germany – from cybersecurity co-operation to arms control and development co-operation in Africa.A key factor in realising the policy review is funding. An embassy survey flagged culture as the single most visible platform for Ireland in Germany. Yet, even as Ireland’s economy recovers, its annual cultural spend in Germany is a quarter that of Denmark and a fifth of Finland’s, two similarly sized countries.While those countries have dedicated cultural spaces, the report is likely to recommend rebranding the existing Embassy space as an “Ireland House” for cultural events.Frankfurt has emerged as the likely home of a new permanent consulate, given it is home to the European Central Bank, major European banks, the IDA and Tourism Ireland.The plan also underlines how selling Ireland, its products and services to Germany cannot happen unless those doing so speak German. With that in mind, the plan identifies a need for a new German language-learning push in Ireland and renewal of German-Irish education links.German officials have welcomed Ireland’s strategic review as timely. Mr Maas will use his first visit to Dublin – before heading on to London – to underline Berlin’s backing for Ireland’s Brexit position.Berlin officials see the Republic as a litmus test for Brexit: if it can be made work with minimum disruption on the island, it will work for the EU27.While Mr Maas is in Dublin, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will hold his first meeting in Berlin with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz. As well as discussing post-Brexit EU budget planning, Mr Donohoe will sound out the Social Democrat minister on whether to expect continuity or change from Berlin on the EU tax debate which, in Germany, has focused on Ireland.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Emmanuel Macron says he has proof of Syria\u0026rsquos guilt but needs to gather more informationOfficials believe both chlorine and a nerve agent were used in weekend attackTrump breaks with national security protocols to warn of imminent attack on SyriaUS president keen on sending strong message to Assad, but at what potential cost?Eurocontrol warns carriers to exercise caution over eastern Mediterranean regionRegime and Russian allies blame Israel for strike on air base in which 14 killedPresident Rouhani says Tehran\u0026rsquos response would be stronger than US imaginesLegal action is first war crimes-related case against Syrian regime to reach courtDozens in eastern Ghouta reported dead UN security council to meet on MondayRescuers describe the scramble to help victims of the alleged chemical attack in DoumaIsraeli sharpshooters have been stopping attempts to breach border or sabotage fenceFacing corruption allegations, national security crises and questions about his fitness for leadership, the long-serving prime minister\u0026rsquos political future is far from certainErdogan\u0026rsquos show of force in Afrin means that even his allies do not trust himSyrian regime forces push into Douma as rebels attempt to maintain presence in townRenewed violence comes despite UN urging Israel to exercise \u0026lsquoextreme caution\u0026rsquoForeign archaeologists no longer come and there are no funds for reconstructionGovernment lifts cinema ban as part of ambitious economic and social reformsMixed messages emerge from meeting between Donald Trump and National Security CouncilRussian-brokered deal allows Jaish al-Islam fighters and their families to leavePresident faced no serious challenger after potential candidates withdrew under pressureThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/30/TELEMMGLPICT000159114527_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"british cheese now status symbol us japan","story":"British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroadBritish cheese exports are booming in a boost for the UK economy, thanks to a growing demand for smelly cheeseboards in US and Japan.British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroad, experts have said. Cheese producers now send around a third of their product abroad, with January 2018 seeing a 23 per cent increase in UK cheese exports compared with January of 2017, data from Dairy UK shows.English Blue Stilton cheese for sale at Broadway Market, HackneyFor example a £25m pound expansion is underway at a historic dairy in Leicestershire to meet a surge in demand for cheese from overseas.

According to reports in the US, the targets selected include two Syrian airfields, a research centre and a chemical weapons facility.The dialogue between Washington and Moscow is understood to have enabled the Prime Minister to assure her Cabinet that adequate plans are now in place to restrict the fallout from any British participation in military strikes on Syria.During a two-hour emergency Cabinet meeting, Mrs May secured the backing of ministers to join an international response “to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime”, Downing Street said.A Downing Street spokesperson said:   “The Prime Minister spoke to President Trump about Syria this evening.  “They agreed that the Assad regime had established a pattern of dangerous behaviour in relation to the use of chemical weapons.  “They agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged, and on the need to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.  “They agreed to keep working closely together on the international response.”Mr Trump - who had warned Russia on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” - toned down his rhetoric on Thursday by saying that a missile strike could be “very soon or not so soon at all”.The White House said \u0026quotno final decision\u0026quot had been made on Syria in a statement issued after the NSC meeting, adding that intelligence was still being assessed. The statement added that Mr Trump will talk to Mrs May and Emmanuel Macron, the French President, to discuss the next steps. David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, who voted against military action in Syria in 2013, signalled before the Cabinet meeting that Mrs May had satisfied him adequate planning had been carried out.He said that when David Cameron proposed military action five years ago he failed to provide the “evidence and intelligence” to justify strikes, and also did not have “a proper plan which was thought through properly”.Affected Syrian kids wait to receive medical treatment after Assad regime forces allegedly conducted poisonous gas attack to Duma town of Eastern Ghouta in DamascusMr Davis added: “Those two things I’m assured we’re going to answer today.”Britain’s ambassador to the United Nations said on Thursday that there must be “meaningful consequences” for those who use chemical weapons, signalling Theresa May’s resolve to join the international response.Downing Street said that the Cabinet - all of whom spoke during the meeting - “agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged”.The Cabinet also agreed on “the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress”, helping make the legal case for taking military action without the backing of the UN.The US is moving ten warships and two submarines into position armed with up to 700 Tomahawk cruise missiles, while Theresa May has ordered at least one British submarine to the area with a capability to fire up to 38 Tomahawks against Assad regime targets.Before chairing the meeting of his National Security Council President Trump said: “We’re having a number of meetings today. We\u0027re looking very, very seriously, very closely at that whole situation. We\u0027ll see what happens, folks, we’ll see what happens…“Now we have to make some further decisions. They\u0027ll be made fairly soon.\u0026quot He added that: “It\u0027s too bad that the world puts us in a position like that.\u0026quotNBC reported that US officials have found chlorine and a \u0026quotnerve agent\u0026quot present in blood and urine samples from victims of last Saturday’s attack on Douma, Eastern Ghouta.The Assad regime is known to have stocks of the nerve agent sarin, and has previously used a mixture of chlorine and sarin in attacks, according to US officials.Meanwhile Mr Macron is expected to join any allied response, said he had “proof” that the Syrian Government had used the chemical weapons.Speaking at a meeting of a UN committee on chemical weapons, Karen Pierce, the British ambassador to the UN, said: “We stand on the cusp of a nightmare – where weapons of mass destruction are used with impunity.\u0026quotIt is not enough just to condemn this. We need to find a way to take meaningful action and ensure that there are meaningful consequences for perpetrators.\u0026quotWe have all benefited from the international order that has kept us safe since the end of World War II. It behoves all of us to make every effort to uphold this international architecture.\u0026quotThe Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, confirmed that Russia and the US were talking on a “deconfliction line” set up in 2015 to co-ordinate air strikes, which operates between US central command in Qatar and Russia’s equivalent in Syria.He said: “The line exists and it is active. In general, the line is used by both sides.”The affirmation by Mr Putin\u0027s spokesman that communications with the United States were ongoing showed “they understand there\u0027s danger and are trying to avoid it,” according to defence analyst Alexander Golts.The US gave Russia around 90 minutes warning for a strike with 59 Tomahawks against the Shayrat airbase in April last year after another chemical weapons attack.US-Russia weapons in SyriaThe respected Kommersant newspaper in Russia reported that Russia “is expecting to receive coordinates of the targets at which the United States is planning to launch strikes”.Russia\u0027s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the priority in Syria was “to avert the danger of war”. Following a closed-door meeting of the Security Council he was asked if he was referring to a war between the United States and Russia and said: \u0026quotWe cannot exclude any possibilities unfortunately.\u0026quotJeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, insisted that Parliament must be “consulted” on any decision to take military action.He said: “Surely the lessons of Iraq, the lessons that came there from the Chilcot report, are that there has to be a proper process of consultation. Just imagine the scenario if an American missile shoots down a Russian plane or vice versa. Where do we go from there?”The Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Parliament “can and should be recalled immediately” to vote on the issue.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday evening: \u0026quotPresident Trump just finished a meeting with his National Security team to discuss the situation in Syria. No final decision has been made.\u0026quotWe are continuing to asses intelligence and are engaged in conversations with our partners and allies.

More of us are getting beyond our eighties, so we have got those people who need support and who are still with us.\u0026quotPeople planning to stop work this year expect to give their families £360 a month on average, a total of £4,320 after tax in a year. One in five said they handed out £500 a month on average to family members. Much of the money is going to fund university fees and living costs, with 23 per cent of people saying the cash was used for this. Another 22 per cent were helping family members buy a home, while 27 per cent were helping with everyday costs such as food and travel. A minority of retirees - one in four - said they had a family but did not provide them with any financial support. Women were slightly more generous than men, and said they expected to provide an average of £374 a month to family members, £25 more than the average for men. .html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}I think the parents and grandparents who have that money are feeling that they don\u0026#x27t want to go to their grave in a gold-lined coffin.High house prices compared to salaries leave many millennials unable to buy without financial help from parents or grandparents. The average first-time buyer is now in their early 30s, compared to just 23 in 1960. Figures released last year by Legal \u0026amp General suggested that the “bank of Mum and dad” now helps to fund a quarter of house purchases, lending more than £6.5bn to help younger relatives buy a home. Some parents and grandparents could also be spending more money on their children’s education following changes to funding rules which have replaced non-repayable maintenance grants with loans.Mr Russell added: “The 2018 generation of retirees have benefited to a large extent with the property boom, with stock market booms, with having final salary pension schemes. \u0026quotFewer and fewer of the future generation, unless they’re in the public sector, will have that secure high level of income.\u0026quot\u0026quotI think the parents and grandparents who have that money are feeling that they don\u0027t want to go to their grave in a gold-lined coffin, they\u0027re quite happy to help where they can.\u0026quotCrackdown on bogus holiday sickness claims \u0026#39tarnishing our reputation abroad\u0026#39Emily Thornberry calls on May to apologise to Commonwealth over historic British wrongdoingDrinking more than five glasses of wine a week could knock years off life, study suggestsUS-Russia ‘hotline’ for Syrian air strikes could help avoid conflict escalatingJames Comey claims Donald Trump wanted him to investigate \u0026#39pee tape\u0026#39 allegations to reassure Melania Eleven lions found dead in Uganda national park in suspected poisoningExclusive: Jeremy Hunt admits breaking Government\u0026#39s own rules over company he used to buy seven flatsSocial care loses out to \u0026#39mythologised\u0026#39 NHSComment: US Homeland Security is compiling a database of journalists and ‘media influencers’.

In the last year, bitcoin has risen by over 500 per cent in value.At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at around $7,700 on the Coinbase exchange.In recent weeks, bitcoin has slowly fallen in value amid fears that the highs seen in late 2017 were the result of a bubble. At its peak last December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000.Other leading cryptocurrencies have mirrored bitcoin\u0027s return to form, with ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS all experiencing gains of more than 10 per cent over the last 24 hours.Bitcoin Cash feud deepens as famous @Bitcoin Twitter account mysteriouWill bitcoin recover from its worst ever start to a year?Cryptocurrency analysts recently suggested that bitcoin\u0027s recent demise was only temporary, predicting a turn in fortunes for the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency.Speaking to The Independent earlier this month, one expert said the price of bitcoin could return to its 2017 highs and even push beyond.“The price has been driven by speculators and they suddenly got cold feet but there’s considerable effort going on behind the scenes, including new underlying technology that is powering faster transactions,” said Michael Jackson, the former COO of Skype who now works in the cryptocurrency space.“Meanwhile, regulators seem open-minded and are now working to eliminate the risks for consumers. So I see no reason why bitcoin shouldn\u0027t’t fulfil its dream. And if it does then recent price falls will appear trivial.This forecast comes in contrast to comments from economists at Barclay\u0027s bank this week, which labelled bitcoin\u0027s 2017 price rise an infection that spread like a disease.Such analysis would suggest that the falling price meant the disease had been treated and gains of that scale would not be seen again.“We developed a theoretical model of an asset price with a pool of speculative investors and compared it with actual bitcoin price behaviour to see what it might imply for the future dynamics, the economists said.The model has clear parallels with compartmental models of the spread of an infectious disease in epidemiology.Follow our bitcoin live blog for the latest updates.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesQuaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The allegations centre around online strategies for the manipulation of voters deployed in the US 2016 Presidential election and the UK’s European Union referendum. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has given evidence to parliament. Meanwhile, across the pond, Mark Zuckerberg will reportedly testify in front of the US Congress. The backlash has been brutal with the #DeleteFacebook movement taking off. Markets have responded accordingly with Facebook’s share value plummeting.Writing in The Observer last year, Carole Cadwalladr posited that Britain (and one may as well add the US) are increasingly looking like “a ‘managed’ democracy. Paid for by a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us.”However, the real story is much bigger than the fallout from the Trump election and the Brexit vote. It is a story that extends beyond a limited set of players in Silicon Valley and the billionaire super class. It encompasses governments, the military and intelligence agencies intent on exploiting the internet and social media for surveillance, control and manipulation of citizens and societies. Facebook removes hundreds of pages controlled by Russian organisationThe concept of managed democracy stretches back a hundred years. After the introduction of universal suffrage, the establishment was concerned about the outcome of elections. During the 1920s Edward Bernays was one of the pivotal figures who helped to develop the concept of managed democracy. Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud and the father of modern-day public relations. He understood that advertising could subliminally tap into the unconscious of repressed animal instincts, such as sexual desire. Bernays’ clients included some of the largest US corporations. Bernays transplanted the same techniques into politics as outlined in Adam Curtis’s 2002 BBC documentary The Century of the Self. This could be achieved through propaganda in various guises, such as the use of mass media in order to manipulate populations. The US military and CIA deployed psychological operations (mass propaganda induced through emotions) across the world in various theatres ranging from the wars in Korea and Vietnam to Central America during the Cold War. The only difference today is that the internet has become the new playground for 21st century psychological operations. How Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlHow Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlDonald Trump, Mike Pence and technology company chiefs at a meeting at Trump Tower in New York, 2016Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly agreed to testify before the US Congress following pressure from politiciansThe 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease around technologyGoogle’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in IraqChristopher Wylie, one of the founders of Cambridge Analytica and now a whistleblower who exposed how the data firm harvested data from millions of Facebook usersAccording to The Observer, billionaire Robert Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10 million stake in the company Cambridge Analytica.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, prior to the US 2016 election, online automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Whisteblower Edward Snowden\u0027s files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook.Silicon Valley – from heroes to villainsFor a long time, Silicon Valley presented itself as the shiny, happy face of capitalism. It sold the promise of new technology that could connect the global village. Facebook’s mission statement was, “Making the world more open and connected”. The internet even held out the utopian possibility of liberating societies. Networks amplified political activism and bypassed the monopoly of the corporate media. The internet provided a cloak of anonymity for whistleblowers fighting state andor corporate power. Wikileaks and Julian Assange would even attempt to take credit for catalysing the Arab Spring through the Cablegate leaks revealing the corruption and vulgar excesses of tinpot dictators. Yet as with all technology, it has proved to be a double-edged sword. Disturbing revelations have exposed a darker side of exploitative, highly secretive and even sinister practices. Public sentiment has turned from infatuation to outrage. The 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease.The marriage of big data and neoliberalism enabled the metrics of the market to be extended to every sphere in society. A Black Mirror episode “Nosee” imagined the dystopian vision in which this process is taken to its logical conclusion. Every emotional experience, lived moment and interaction is exploited, mined, recorded and measured with constant recalibration interfacing with one’s personal score and therefore social status. Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, is one of those credited with creating the profession of public relations (Getty)From here it is a short step to Foucault’s concept of the panopticon in which each person is scrutinising and scrutinised by everyone else. The mass collection and retention of data became linked in with surveillance – big brother meets big data. Simultaneously, big tech managed to carve out a libertarian philosophy while being integrated with the national security state. In fact, Silicon Valley has increasingly become part of the military-industrial complex selling its technologies to US military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Google, for example, has a contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) allowing the agency to use Google Earth Builder. Google’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in Iraq, while Google and the NGA purchased GeoEye-1, which is the world’s highest-resolution satellite. Lacie, the protagonist in the ‘Black Mirror’ episode ‘Nosee’, rating her social interactions on her phone (Getty)In fact, Google has a revolving door with the national security state employing managers with backgrounds in military and intelligence work and it partners with defence contractors including Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman focusing on drones and robotics. Similarly, Amazon has developed a $600m (£426m) cloud computing system for the CIA that also services all 17 US intelligence agencies. Data-mining tech company Palantir was co-founded by Trump donor and backer Peter Thiel. Palantir’s advisers include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet. Its customers include the NSA, FBI and CIA due to the fact that it is a leader in the field of mining massive data sets. It has been deployed by the Marines in Afghanistan and in the Mexican drug war. Its commercial clients include Bank of America, JPMorgan, News Corp and pharmaceutical firms. Peter Thiel is a Silicon Valley tech billionaire, who also co-founded PayPal as a system of electronic payment. He went on to give Mark Zuckerberg the first outside investment in Facebook consisting of a half-million-dollar loan later converted into a 7 per cent ownership stake and a seat on the board. Thiel’s hedge fund Clarium Capital Management had assets of more than $7bn before the financial crisis. His venture-capital firm Founders Fund has an online manifesto that begins, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters” – summing up his pessimistic stance on the demise of technological utopianism.Thiel has cultivated a libertarian persona outlined in a 2009 essay titled The Education of a Libertarian. This fleshes out the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy since the 1920s. He argues that capitalism is “not popular with the crowd”. Thiel disparages the “unthinking demos”, which has made greater demands for social democratic concessions thus constraining capitalism. Thiel is apparently obsessed with economic stagnation diagnosing that, “without a new technology revolution, globalisation’s discontents would lead to increased conflict and, perhaps, a worldwide conflagration”. He is contemptuous of the failure of imagination of disconnected elites with the danger being that people will turn against capitalism. This is supported by a 2016 Harvard study, which found that a majority of American millennials reject capitalism with a third supporting socialism. It is also in keeping with the demographic shifts driving the Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn phenomena, in turn fuelled by intergenerational injustice. Is Trump right to say Amazon is costing the US Post Office billions?Trump’s biggest campaign donor was Robert Mercer – a reclusive American hedge-fund billionaire and computer scientist. Mercer began his career at IBM working on breakthroughs in language processing integral to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). He went on to become joint CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, which applies algorithms to model and trade on financial markets. One of its funds – Medallion – is reportedly the most successful in the world. All of which has enabled Mercer to coordinate with the Koch brothers donating tens of millions of dollars to Republican political campaigns and ultra-conservative organisations. As The New Yorker investigative journalist Jane Mayer relates, both Mercer and oil tycoon William Lee Hanley had commissioned polling from Patrick Caddell ahead of the 2016 election, which showed “mounting anger towards wealthy elites, who many Americans believed had corrupted the government so that it served only their interests. There was a hunger for a populist presidential candidate who would run against the major political parties and the ruling class.” The data “showed that someone could just walk into this election and sweep it,” Caddell told me. When Mercer saw the numbers, he asked for the polling to be repeated. Caddell got the same results. “It was stunning,” he said. “The country was on the verge of an uprising against its leaders. I just fell over!”.Caddell and partners later went public with the Candidate Smith project based on the idea that the public wanted an outsider Mr. Smith Goes to Washington figure as president. Worryingly, the data also revealed that the public was yearning for a strong man to fix the country. Thiel (pictured with Donald Trump in 2016) is contemptuous of disconnected elites who he believes are turning people against capitalismAccording to The Observer, Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10m stake in the company Cambridge Analytica. It managed to build a 230-million-strong US voter database collecting up to 5,000 pieces of demographic, psychological, consumer and lifestyle information about each inidual with Facebook proving vital to this data profiling. The company is focused on the manipulation of psychographics – the study of personality traits – although its officials claim that this was not deployed in the 2016 US election. The power of the computer algorithms in question is such that 150 Facebook likes can be modelled to predict a person’s behaviour better than a family member. Three-hundred likes effectively means that the algorithm knows you better than a spouse. The effectiveness of this manipulation remains disputed although the power to micro-target iniduals and to induce mass effects at a population level points to sinister implications. Some authorities, such as Emma Briant (author of Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change), have stated that Cambridge Analytica has the technological capability to effect behavioural and psychological change.Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix told a conference in New York his company was able to predict the personality of every adult in the US (Getty)Cambridge Analytica’s parent company is British corporation SCL Group – formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories. SCL Group works on psychological operations and foreign propaganda campaigns. It collects large amounts of data about an audience in order to identify “persuadables” and target them with tailored messages.  Alexander Nix, the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, declared at a 2016 conference in New York that, “by having hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans undertake this survey, we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America”. SCL has worked in more than 60 countries including Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Pakistan. It “offers military clients techniques in ‘soft power’”, specialises in “election management strategies” and “messaging and information operations”. It has worked for Nato, the UK Ministry of Defence and the US State Department amongst others in “changing the behaviour of large groups”. In 2012, Facebook conducted studies involving secretive psychological testing of approximately 700,000 of its users. This was through reducing exposure to positive or negative emotional content in order to measure the effects. The study concluded: “Emotions expressed by friends, via online social networks, influence our own moods, constituting, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence for massive-scale emotional contagion via social networks.” This study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, while another Facebook project looked at how users consumed information on Twitter.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, one-third of all traffic on Twitter prior to the EU referendum was generated by automated “bots”, which were all pro-Leave and prior to the US 2016 election, the same automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Similarly, there were hundreds of automated websites pumping out pro-Trump messages crafting a mass consensus or political climate. Reportedly, there are thousands of dormant “sleeper” bots presumably waiting to be activated during a future crisis. The war on terror has enabled the state to amass authoritarian control over iniduals. The Washington Post’s 2010 Top Secret America investigation painted a terrifying vision of the US morphing into an Orwellian big brother state.Militarisation of homeland security is now extensive. General Atomics’ Predator drones monitor the Mexican and Canadian borders through real-time, full-motion video cameras. The Department of Homeland Security collects pictures, videos and other data on American citizens. It even helped Memphis police set up a crime-analysis fusion centre fitted with walls of streaming surveillance video capable of matching army command controls, while Maryland Police have infiltrated and labelled political activist groups dedicated to human rights, anti-war and bike lanes as terrorists.This conflation of the war on terror with political activism means that the definition of terrorism is widened to include any enemy of the state andor corporate interests. Edward Snowden and Julian Assange can thus be viewed as political prisoners or exiles. The US Department of Defence has been funding research into the use of the internet for 21st century psychological operations. The Pentagon’s military research arm – the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) – has been conducting experiments on the internet in order to study social connections, propagation of messages and influence behaviour. In fact, Darpa invented the precursor of the internet – Arpanet, Darpa’s social media in strategic communication (SMISC) programme is developing algorithms for the “formation, development and spread of ideas and concepts (memes)” on social media. SMISC is channelling millions in funding for projects to corporations and academic hubs. This has included studies analysing how Occupy activists used Twitter, Twitter users’ opinions on fracking and interactions of Twitter users in the Middle East. Recent revelations suggest that Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 million Facebook users (Getty)The journalist Glenn Greenwald has revealed that both the NSA (National Security Agency) and its UK sister GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) have been working on exploiting social media. According to the Snowden files, this entails “propaganda”, “deception”, “mass messaging” and “pushing stories”. While GCHQ described its intentions to seed “state propaganda” across the internet. GCHQ’s Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) is focused on “using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world” including “information ops (influence or disruption)”.US defence corporation General Dynamics is also involved in information operations. This includes contracts with the Special Operations Command’s psychological operations unit to design websites in order to persuade foreigners to align views with US interests.In-Q-Tel – the CIA’s venture capital firm – has been investing in companies engaged in social media mining and surveillance. Dataminr streams data from Twitter to spot trends for law enforcement agencies and hedge funds. Geofeedia collects social media messages in order to track activists for police departments and corporations. Pathar is used by the FBI to mine social media in order to determine networks and signs of radicalisation. Netbase is capable of scanning billions of sources online and Recorded Future monitors the worldwide web to predict future events. Bruce Lund wrote in a 2012 paper that “monitoring social media” is increasingly essential for government tracking of “erupting political movements, crises, epidemics, and disasters, not to mention general global trends”. Such strategies can be exploited for counterterrorism but are also being turned against citizens by law enforcement and against activist groups by the private sector. Palantir was thus exposed in negotiations to track trade union activists and other critics of the US Chamber of Commerce. Various police departments and corporations such as McDonald’s have contracted with Geofeedia, which markets its research into student demonstrations, Greenpeace and other political movements. In 2008, an Obama adviser, Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein, wrote a controversial paper advocating the use of covert agents in order to cognitively infiltrate online groups, sites and activists. The Snowden files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook, attempt to “control, infiltrate, manipulate and warp online discourse” and remarkably even carry out “false flag operations” in order to discredit targets.In a wide-ranging New Yorker profile, Peter Thiel told author George Packer that the failures of the establishment have rekindled his optimism pointing the way either towards libertarianism or, conversely, Marxism, although he was forced to concede that unfettered capitalism is not acceptable to ordinary Americans.Peter has cultivated a libertarian persona – a 2009 essay fleshes out what he regard as the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy (Alamy)His thinking essentially represents the extreme manifestation of a growing consensus amongst elites that the status quo is unsustainable. This could lead potentially to instability, systemic collapse and civilizational crisis. In turn, this could pave the way either towards progressive, radical post-capitalist transformation that would necessarily damage vested interests – or conversely an authoritarian order designed to cement those interests. In fact, the status quo is liable to exacerbate inequality, poverty, climate change and social isions ensuring that authoritarian measures are necessary in the face of increasing rioting, disruption and social unrest. Indeed, economist and writer Joseph Stiglitz, who was previously chief economist at the World Bank, has piquantly asked how long it will be before the scenes witnessed during the Arab Spring will be replicated on the streets of America. As Thiel has put it: “The future will be much better or much worse, but the question of the future remains very open indeed. We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of iniduals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.” It appears that Thiel conceives of himself as this John Galt-type heroic figure lifted straight out of the pages of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. The battleground of politics has expanded to include the virtual world of the internet. This is in keeping with media theorist Marshall McLuhan’s prediction that World War Three would be a guerrilla information war with no distinction between military and civilian participation. Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Speaking at the TED conference in Vancouver on Wednesday, Gwynne Shotwell said SpaceX will send humans to Mars in order to make humanity a multi-planetary species and push forward the search for alien life.“This is the first step to us moving to other solar systems and potentially other galaxies,” Ms Shotwell said. “Fundamentally you go to other places to explore. That’s what makes humans different from animals.“This is the only time I out-vision Elon: I want to meet people, or whatever they call themselves, in another solar system.”SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System When built, the rocket needed for the Mars mission - the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) - will have a “residual capacity” of also improving Earth-based transportation. According to Ms Shotwell, the BFR will be capable of carrying around 100 passengers at speeds much faster than current aircraft. Flying from the US to China, for example, would only take around 30 to 40 minutes. “I’m personally invested in this one because I travel a lot, and I do not like to travel,” Shotwell said. “I would love to get to see my customers in Riyadh, leave in the morning and be back in time to make dinner.”Scientists may have discovered why there are so few aliensMr Musk has frequently expressed his ambition to send people to Mars in order to form a colony that would help sustain humanity in the event of a species-ending event, such as the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence.Such technology represents “our biggest existential threat,” Mr Musk said in 2014, adding that its development was similar to “summoning the demon.”While a human colony on the Red Planet might offer some safeguards for the future of humanity, Mr Musk says the first people to take part in Mars missions would most likely be risking their own lives.“It kind of reads like Shackleton’s ad for Antarctic explorers,” Musk told the crowd at the SXSW festival last month. “Difficult, dangerous, good chance you’ll die. Excitement for those who survive.”A simulated mission to Mars by Israel\u0027s Space Agency, near Mitzpe Ramon, Israel, February 18, 2018. Rocket startup SpaceX wants to send humans to Mars within a decade. (REUTERSRonen Zvulun)Mr Musk’s timeline for beginning manned missions to Mars to set up a potentially species-saving colony is more ambitious than that of Ms Shotwell’s predictions. Last year, the billionaire polymath said he believed the first cargo mission to Mars would be possible in 2022, with the first manned mission following just two years after. The SpaceX founder does not always meet his enthusiastic deadlines, having struggled in the past to meet production goals with one of his other companies - electric car maker Tesla.Ms Shotwell referred to the wild timelines set by Mr Musk as “Elon time,” but said that the latest projections for achieving manned missions to Mars were from her own calculations.“That’s my time,” she said. “Not Elon time.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

A survey found 31 per cent of people are paying out £4,300 a year on average, increasing pressure on their own retirement plans and income.They are providing financial support to three people on average with their or their partner’s children the most likely (56 per cent) to be receiving money. Number of people retiring after age 70 doubles since 2010 Among those paying for younger generations, a quarter said they were giving money to grandchildren, 8 per cent to their parents and 2 per cent to their grandparents.Nearly one in five expecting to retire this year estimate they provide more than £500 a month to family members.   The money is most commonly used to cover everyday living costs such as food and travel, according to 27 per cent of those who give money monthly. However, 23 per cent say they are providing financial support to help with university education fees and living costs while 22 per cent say some of the cash goes to help with getting on the property ladder.Women are slightly more generous than men, expecting to provide an average of £374 a month to family members, compared to men who will hand over £25 less every month. Stan Russell, retirement income expert at Prudential, said that rising financial pressures such as the cost of university education and buying a home meant that providing financial support to family members continues well into retirement.  “While it’s understandable so many people want to financially support family members, it is important to make sure they have enough money set aside themselves to cover their own living costs and don’t put their retirement at risk,” he said.  The study found that a quarter of people retiring this year have families but don’t provide them with any financial support, while 43 per cent do not have any dependents.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She also highlighted the plight of refugees on Papua New Guinea\u0027s Manus Island and Nauru where Australia holds asylum seekers in refugee processing centres. Politicians and other critics accused her of politicising the day and she later removed the post.It was brought to my attention that my last post was disrespectful and for that, I apologise unreservedly,” she wrote at the time.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesShi\u0027ite pilgrims carry a symbolic casket outside Imam Moussa al-Kadhim\u0027s shrine to mark the anniversary of his death in Baghdad, IraqSeasonal winds washed tons of debris ashore at Matahari Terbit beach, near Sanur, Bali, Indonesia.Syrian onlookers gather around rescue teams clearing the rubble at the site of an explosion of unknown origin which wrecked a multi-storey building the previous night in the war-battered country\u0027s northwestern city of Idlib.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesShi\u0027ite pilgrims carry a symbolic casket outside Imam Moussa al-Kadhim\u0027s shrine to mark the anniversary of his death in Baghdad, IraqSeasonal winds washed tons of debris ashore at Matahari Terbit beach, near Sanur, Bali, Indonesia.Syrian onlookers gather around rescue teams clearing the rubble at the site of an explosion of unknown origin which wrecked a multi-storey building the previous night in the war-battered country\u0027s northwestern city of Idlib.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.
