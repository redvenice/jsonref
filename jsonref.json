For the three preceding days, his mother Lisa had begged staff to induce his birth but they refused because, she said, they failed to recognise her extreme back pain as a sign her labour had commenced.Ms Duffy was not examined by a consultant for six days before Luke’s death. The inquest heard evidence the maternity unit was very busy over the bank holiday weekend and all available slots for inducing the baby were booked until 6pm on October 29th, the day he died.Baby Luke was delivered stillborn a day later, following a “harrowing and protracted” labour, she said.Ms Duffy said healthy babies are losing their lives because medical staff “think they know best”.“It’s a pandemic in its own right,” she said, adding that staff need to recognise that “women know their bodies best” and to act on their concerns. Michael Knowles, general manager of the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise, expressed “sincere apologies” for failings in the care given to baby Luke and said it would do “everything possible” to ensure they did not happen again.Ms Duffy, from Mountrath, said she had experienced back pain only, and not abdominal pain, but she wasn’t examined by staff as “they didn’t believe it was genuine”.Consultant obstetrician Dr Miriam Doyle, who was not on duty on the weekend Ms Duffy was admitted, agreed back pain has a “recognised association” with labour. Some women experience only back pain during labour and for others it starts in the back and moves to the front, she said.Ms Duffy’s pregnancy was considered high-risk and induction of her baby was suggested during a visit to the hospital in mid-October 2018. On October 26th she presented with contractions.She said her understanding, based on a conversation with staff two days earlier, was that she was going into hospital that day to be induced.Ms Duffy said she asked registrar Dr Anthony Breen to begin the induction process but he said they were sticking to the original plan to induce her on October 29th. On Saturday October 27th, she again asked Dr Breen to begin induction but he suggested she might be more comfortable at home.On the Sunday, she said she again begged for induction but Dr Breen refused.She started to worry about her ability to push out the baby as she was so tired. “No internal examination was carried out as each midwife claimed I would only get an infection and since I did not have any abdominal pains my baby was not ready to come out.”On Monday October 29th, she said she felt fetal movements after breakfast but shortly afterwards a nurse was unable to detect the baby’s heartbeat. Fetal death was diagnosed after 9am.She said Dr Doyle came to her later in the day and seemed surprised that she had not been examined since the Friday.Ms Duffy said she was initially advised to go home and “process the news” despite being in labour. But she was kept in due to high blood pressure and she eventually delivered her stillborn son Luke the following day, October 30th, at 39 weeks and two days gestation. She described the labour as “a living nightmare”.Dr Doyle agreed with Sara Antoniotti BL, with Liston Flavin solicitors, that Luke would have been born alive if he had been induced earlier.She said the problem was that it wasn’t possible to book a slot for induction earlier than Monday October 29th.She said the level of activity in the unit in the preceding days - a bank holiday weekend - was such that all available slots were full. A consultant was on-call in the unit at all times and it was “unlikely” he was not in the hospital at the time, she said.The inquest heard Dr Breen was unavailable to give evidence to the inquest on Monday, a situation the coroner described as “unsatisfactory”.Consultant perinatal pathologist Dr Peter Kelehan said baby Luke was a normally formed, big infant on examination, with no evidence of congenital abnormality. Portlaoise hospital has been the subject of several reports into baby deaths at its maternity unit over the past decade. From 2012, it emerged at least five babies had died in the hospital due to a lack of oxygen after staff failed to recognise or act on signs of foetal distress.Monday’s inquest took place 10 years to the day from the death in the hospital of newborn Mark Molloy, whose parents Roisin and Mark have since campaigned for improved standards in maternity care.Speaking after the inquest, Ms Duffy and her husband Mel described their son’s death as “something that should never have happened” and said the tragic events that took place over the 2018 October bank holiday weekend “continue to cast a shadow over our lives”.“We believe that learnings must come from his sad and needless loss, that expectant mothers must be listened to, for the safety of both the mother and the baby.

Photograph: Eamon WardThe Minister for Further and Higher Education told a vigil on Monday in memory of teacher Ashling Murphy, and attended by her heartbroken family, that politicians, particularly men, need to stand up and take action against misogyny and violence against women.Minister Simon Harris told thousands of people gathered with candles on the grounds of Ms Murphy’s alma mater, Mary Immaculate College (MIC), Limerick: “I wanted to be here because I’m a man, a father, and a politician, and I know that our gender, and our profession, need to do better, we need to do much more.”“As fathers of young sons, we have a duty in how we raise them, in how we ensure they are part of a cultural change as politicians we have got to change the system.”This change, the Minister affirmed, included his “duty to ensure that third level is safe, and that every single one of us, as men, must call out misogyny and we must stand up and speak out”.Mr Harris became emotional as he encouraged those of Ms Murphy’s generation and future generations of women and men who he said “demand action for Ashling”, to keep shouting for change.AlliesMr Harris offered that politicians, including himself, “must be allies in that cause, and work with you to champion and to deliver that in every possible way we can”.“So, tonight here we all commit to action for Ashling, because we owe it to her, we owe it to her beautiful family, and we owe it to you,” Mr Harris added.President of MIC, Professor Eugene Wall, fought back tears as he welcomed Ms Murphy’s parents Kathleen and Raymond, sister Amy, brother Cathal, and her boyfriend Ryan, to the college where, “almost four months ago on this day, Ashling emerged, happily clutching her degree parchment having realised her long held ambition to become a primary teacher”.Mr Wall said the MIC graduate’s killing had “sent shockwaves throughout the entire nation and abroad”.MIC Chaplain, Fr Michael Wall, said the killing which occurred in daylight on a public walkway as Ms Murphy was simply out enjoying a jog, had presented a national outpouring of “confusion, anxiety, sadness, anger, and upheaval” and that women, particularly, were suffering “with a range of fears and anxieties and worries”.Fr Wall said while there had been “various calls for change” he hoped for direction and wisdom “for our leaders, our politicians, our legislators, our law enforcement people, our leaders and influencers, to make decisions that will lead to a better life for all”.The Mayor of Limerick, Fine Gael Cllr Daniel Butler, said that it was up to political leaders like himself “to make decisions, and, to make sure that (Ashling’s) loss is not a futile one”.Mayor Butler added: “I know us - as men - must do better, and will do better.”Dearest friendMaura Murray, a classmate from Tullamore, and who went on to study at MIC with Ms Murphy, fought back tears paying a heartfelt tribute to “our dearest friend ‘Ash’”.“All she ever wanted to do was to become a teacher, which she was born to do. Ashling loved her walks, the fresh air, being surrounded by nature, she had so many plans, we will keep (her) in our hearts and minds... forever, fly high with the angels,” she added.Poems, as well as traditional Irish tunes and Irish folk songs were played from a stage erected on the grounds of the college, in front of a sea of candlelight that shone in the darkness, in memory of the music teaching graduate who was an accomplished musician.Dr Ailbhe Kenny, who taught Ms Murphy at MIC, told those gathered at the vigil not to let fear of violence perpetrated by men against women to poison their right to walk, run, and enjoy their lives and freedom: “Do not allow fear, anger, grief, or sadness, ever get in the way of any of that.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters

Commons according to defector Shaun Woodward: “Relief – and that it’s ghastly.”A little over two decades before Bury South MP Christian Wakeford jumped ship from the Conservative Party to Labour last week, Mr Woodward made the same journey, a process he found both more painful than he could have imagined and, in hindsight, always inevitable. Woodward quit after the Tory leadership under William (now Lord) Hague opposed plans to repeal Section 28, the rule prohibiting the “promotion” of homosexuality in public arenas including schools. Wakeford, a 37-year-old former insurance broker, who was elected as Conservative MP for Derby South in 2019, made his dramatic departure declaring Boris Johnson and his party incapable of providing leadership in the wake of the furore over parties at No 10.Whatever the motivation, nearly all those in the small defectors’ club of MPs say they have no regrets about breaking the ultimate political taboo.Westminster might love the drama of an MP crossing the floor, but what is the human impact on the “traitors” who abandon their tribe – and on the morale of those left behind? Can they ever find a home among politicians and activists who once saw them as the enemy, or are they always viewed with suspicion? Wakeford himself has said the decision to abandon Johnson’s party for that of Sir Keir Starmer was the most difficult of his life. Clearly shaken by the experience, he admitted to sleepless nights and stumbled over his new leader’s name in his first public event as a Labour MP, momentarily giving the impression he was now serving “Keir Llama”. For Woodward too, the decision was a traumatic one – “seismic,” he says - with his departure accelerated, as, allegedly, with Wakeford, by the Whips’ Office attempting to blackmail him into toeing the line.  “I just thought – this is horrible this is not why I came into politics. So I reached out to friends in the Labour Party and said: ‘I don’t think I am going to stay in the Conservative Party.’”“I am very conscious of the people I hurt. But I didn’t go because I would be well received, I went because I couldn’t possibly stay.”Baroness Nicholson, who as Emma Nicholson crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats in 1995, agrees: “I suddenly flipped,” she told Radio 4’s Today programme this week. “I was getting sick and tired of John Major’s vacillation on the European issue. I could suddenly take it no longer.“The worst thing about changing political parties is that you hurt people, and you hurt people who you love dearly, admire, respected, even fought with, but you hurt them very much indeed, and to live with that hurt is really, really difficult.”Like Woodward, who was dismayed by what he saw as the abandonment by Hague of One Nation Toryism, former Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger considers that her party left her, rather than the other way round. In 2019 she co-founded The Independent Group in response to what she viewed as a failure to act against anti-Semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership this later became a new political party, Change UK, before Berger eventually joined the Liberal Democrats.“It was horrific to leave my political home of 20 years,” she reflects, “but in my mind it didn’t in any way represent the values that led me to it in the first place, so I could no longer be a part of it.“I absolutely made the right decision and I don’t have any regrets and I would do it again.” Jumping ship used to be a far more common affair – Winston Churchill decamped from the Conservatives to the Liberal Party in 1904, not returning to the fold for two decades. But even then “ratting” was a high stakes game. When a group of Labour MPs resigned the whip to join Oswald Mosley’s fascist New Party in 1931, two quit after a day to become independents.In recent years, defecting has proven something of a kamikaze mission of the 23 MPs who crossed the floor in the last 30 years, all but four lost their seats at the next election, Berger among them. Of the four who survived, two – including Woodward – had been offered safer seats than those they had won under a different party’s banner.The only two to have triumphed again at the ballot box are Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who quit the Conservatives for the UK Independent Party in 2014 crucially, both took the decision to resign as MPs and stand again in a by-election (Reckless, however, lost at the next general election).Carswell says the decision to fight a by-election was partly tactical, to put maximum pressure on then-prime minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on the question of Britain’s membership of the European Union, but also a matter of principle. Carswell’s defection was greeted relatively positively by both the voters and his party activists in his constituency of Clacton, with many in his local association following him to Ukip. To his surprise, most of his former Conservative colleagues in Parliament also remained on friendly terms.“I think they had respect for the fact that I had submitted myself to a by-election,” he says. “Had I not done that, they would have seen it as a case of getting elected under their colours then abandoning them.”That’s not to say that Carswell didn’t find the process emotional.“Anyone who is leaving one party for another is going to find difficulties. The only way to neutralise that is to resign and call a by-election.”Woodward, however, disagrees. “If you think that every time somebody crosses the floor there should be a by-election then Parliament should change the law. It shouldn’t be a reaction to one inidual’s actions. At the moment we still put the name of the candidate on the ballot paper – not the party.”Saying that, Woodward admits he felt far more comfortable in the Labour Party once he fought a general election in his new seat of St Helens. This, he says, helped him to get away from the disapproval of his former activists in his former constituency of true blue Whitney.Of Wakeford he says: “Actually, I think if he stood for a by-election, he’d probably win.” Additional reporting by Eleanor Steafel Rosa Prince is editor of The House magazineMore from NewsUkraine crisis: Joe Biden prepares troops to face down Russian invasion threatJoe Biden calls Fox News reporter a \u0026#39stupid son of a b****\u0026#39US puts 8,500 troops on \u0026#39heightened alert\u0026#39 to deploy to Europe if Russia invades UkraineAt least six dead in Afcon stampede at Cameroon Comoros matchSajid Javid set to face questions over Nusrat Ghani ‘Muslimness’ sackingUkraine exposes just how weakMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"15m people wrongly told shield covid 19 expert suggests","story":"With Plan B coronavirus restrictions coming to an end on Wednesday, the clinically vulnerable may be understandably nervous about emerging back into society.Although the shielding programme officially ended on September 15 last year, many have continued to exercise caution, and government guidance still encourages mask wearing and social distancing at home, and among family and friends.But The  understands that four fifths of people did not need to shield in the first place, while many of whom were in the most danger were left exposed to the virus. Dr Tony Williams, an occupational physician from the consultancy Working Fit, developed the Covid-Age tool which estimates vulnerability to the virus based on inidual risk factors, and is now officially recommended by the Scottish government.He estimates that 1.5 million people were wrongly asked to shield under the original English guidelines, while about 1.5 million who should have been shielding were never warned. For example, the largest group on the shielding list were patients taking immunosuppressant medication, but their risk of death was just 20 per cent higher than for a healthy male - and far lower than many groups who were not asked to shield.Similarly, severely obese people have a higher risk than those with severe asthma, yet asthmatics were shielded while the obese weren’t. Diabetes has consistently been found to be a  major risk factor for Covid, and was mentioned in nearly one quarter of deaths between October and December last year.  Yet diabetics were only added to the shielding list last February, a year after the pandemic began, and only if they had other risk factors, such as being old, obese or belonging to an at-risk ethnic group. Dr Williams said: “We realised quite quickly that people on the shielding list were not dying, while others that weren’t on it were severely at risk.“One of the key errors was thinking immune-suppressed people were at risk. This is a virus that triggers a deadly cytokine storm, and we’ve now learned that giving people drugs to suppress the immune system has saved thousands of lives. So it’s illogical for these people to be shielding. “A million and a half people have been misled. Another million and a half who should have been shielding were never warned.“Now is an important time to get this message across, with people coming back to work. People who are not at risk need that reassurance.”Because age is the biggest risk factor for Covid, the Covid-Age tool works by crunching risk factors and then giving an equivalent age. For example, an obese 58-year-old with high blood pressure would have a Covid age risk of a 92 year old and should have been shielding, yet would have fallen through the cracks under the original guidelines. Conversely, a 30-year-old with rheumatoid arthritis would have a Covid age of 32, yet would have been asked to shield, and may still be concerned about returning to work. In February 2021, the Government introduced the QCovid tool in an attempt to learn from new data emerging about those at risk. The change added 1.7 million people to the shielding list, but the tool was largely used to prioritise immunisation, and failed to remove people who were at little extra risk. The  understands that when researchers ran the original shielding list through the QCovid algorithm, 80 per cent of people did not need to be on it.Mr Williams added: “Between 1.5 and 1.8 million were unnecessarily shielding, around the same number who should have shielded but were never warned.

Such a vote can be triggered by 15 per cent of Tories (there are 359 MPs as of January 2022, requiring 54 to trigger).Also a member of the executive, elected in January 2020 after Mr Johnson won an 80-seat majority at the 2019 general election, is treasurer Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a regular thorn in the Government’s side who has called for Mr Johnson to “radically reform the way the No 10 operation works”. The executive committee’s secretaries, Gary Sambrook and Bob Blackman, have both been highly critical of the Prime Minister in recent weeks.All six members of the executive committee rebelled over vaccine passports last month - another factor giving rise to suspicions of the 1922 leading a “coup” of sorts.As one senior Tory put it: “The thing that appears to unite the executive of the 1922 committee is their opposition to Boris Johnson and his Government.“They are trying to bounce the new intake to move against the Prime Minister because they cannot make progress with the older hands.”Suggesting that they are working with figures like David Davis, who last week told Mr Johnson, “in the name of God, go”, they added: “Davis is a perpetual assassin and they are working together to try to spook the junior MPs.“What they don’t seem to realise is that they will confound the problem if they turn on their own leader because it just makes the party look both ruthless and feckless at the same time.”Davis insists that he is working “alone”, while 1922 figures deny there is any conspiracy against Mr Johnson. Pointing out that its officers are “elected inidually” and act in that way, a senior 1922 source added: “The Executive is not acting in some sort of concert on this - the Executive tends to be pretty representative of the spectrum of the party.”Despite their protestations, however, there is no doubt that the 1922 is increasingly resembling a recruiting ground for Mr Johnson’s enemies.Mr Sambrook, who was elected to Parliament in 2019 in a so-called “Red Wall” seat, is even rumoured to have sent in a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister. (The MP for Birmingham Northfield has neither confirmed nor denied the reports, although he said of partygate: “I would expect anyone who is found to have broken the law to seriously consider their position in Government, and that includes the Prime Minister.”)In a sign of the increasingly fractious relationship between No 10 and the 1922, Sir Graham, who is also closely aligned to the Covid Research Group (CRG), chaired by outspoken Johnson critic Mark Harper, the former chief whip, was almost replaced by the more pro-Johnson Heather Wheeler last summer. Some say surviving the plot to oust him has made him a more “emboldened” leader of disgruntled backbenchers, especially in light of recent events. Writing for the  last month, he described the Government\u0027s Covid measures as a  “disastrous assault on liberty”.The reaction to partygate among the executive is probably best summed up by its secretary, Mr Blackman, who said: “Many of my constituents have sacrificed so much – not being able to visit sick or grieving relatives or attend funerals. I am clear that those who set the rules must abide by them or face the consequences.”The 1922 committee also has seven executive members who haven’t exactly been singing from No 10’s hymn sheet either. One is Karl McCartney, the MP for Lincoln, who has consistently opposed lockdown restrictions since September 2020, as well as Covid passports for nightclubs last December. He was also one of thirty Conservative MPs who defied Mr Johnson to oppose the law on mandatory jabs for care home workers in 2021. Yet he remains supportive of the Prime Minister, inviting him to his constituency’s Christmas market last month. Fellow executive member Sir Bernard Jenkin has similarly followed the Government line of waiting for the result of Ms Gray’s report before passing judgment on partygate, as has Jason McCartney, the MP for Colne Valley and Nicola Richards, the MP for West Bromwich East. “The PM helped win us seats like mine, he got Brexit done and has pulled us through the pandemic,” she said. “We at least owe it to him to wait for the report before making any judgments about the future.”Sheryll Murray, another executive member of the 1922 and the MP for South East Cornwall, has publicly supported Mr Johnson’s Covid policy but voted against the government over letting Huawei into the 5G network in March 2020.Similarly, Johnson loyalist Martin Vickers has been supportive of the Government\u0027s covid policy but critical over partygate, telling his Cleethorpes constituents: It was irresponsible, reckless and unacceptable and disciplinary actions, and possibly prosecutions, should follow.It seems the same words could be used to describe the band of backbenchers that have given the Prime Minister cause to watch his back. Described the Government’s Covid measures as a “disastrous assault on liberty” and voted against vaccine passports in December 2021.Warned the rising cost of living was a major worry for voters.Remained schtum on partygate.Member of anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group.One of 30 Tory MPs who voted against Johnson’s aid cuts in June 2021.Claims chief whip Mark Spencer said her “Muslimness”cost her her job as transport minister in the February 2020 reshuffle. On partygate, he said: It depends a lot on what Sue Gray\u0027s report says and whether she says directly that he broke the rules. If she says, well, it was a general culture and you know, there\u0027s a fudge, I think then he\u0027s got to do several things.He called for the PM to radically reform the way the No 10 operation works. On Partygate, he said: “We need to get to the bottom of all these activities in No 10, adding: “Many of my constituents have sacrificed so much – not being able to visit sick or grieving relatives or attend funerals. I am clear that those who set the rules must abide by them or face the consequences.”On partygate, called for PM to resign, saying: “A series of unforced errors are deeply damaging to the perception of the party.

We at least owe it to him to wait for the report before making any judgments about the future.”Voted against the government over letting Huawei into the 5G network in March 2020She was critical of Cummings but fell short of urging him to go. Publicly supported Boris over Tories’ defeat in North Shropshire by-election.Defended PM in October 2021, criticising BBC’s Nick Robinson’s interviewing technique: “It’s bizarre for the BBC to welcome the Prime Minister on for the first time in ages and then cut him off in his prime.”Discussing Partygate allegations with constituents, he said: It was irresponsible, reckless and unacceptable and disciplinary actions, and possibly prosecutions, should follow.Said this weekend: The truth is that none of this should have happened.

America’s liberal elites have similarly sneered at Brexit, with The New York Times and The Washington Post publishing ludicrously apocalyptic pieces alleging a downward spiral of British decline after separating from Brussels.But some Brexit opponents in the United States are now changing their tune in the wake of the UK’s tough stance over Ukraine: the crisis has been a wake-up call for those in the United States who believed that the European Union would emerge as a powerful global power working closely with its American allies.Far from mocking the new Brexit era, once-sceptical Washington policy experts are finally starting to realise that America’s partnership with the United Kingdom will likely be strengthened, not weakened, by the historic 2016 decision taken by the British people to exit the European Project.Anthony Gardner, the former US Ambassador to the European Union under President Obama, commented on Sunday:  “As bad as Brexit has been, I fully admit that a significant upside is that the UK can act swiftly in foreign Affairs including Ukraine rather than being dragged into endless EU waffle. No doubt this has been noticed in Washington.”Gardner is not alone in expressing this sentiment. Ryan Evans, founder of the influential War on The Rocks national security site, tweeted: “I was against Brexit but it\u0027s interesting that some of the same people who predicted Brexit would lead to a Britain less relevant in global affairs are today deriding the Johnson govt for playing a muscular a role in the Ukraine crisis.”The EU’s response to Ukraine has been a massive disappointment on the Stateside of the Atlantic. Its two biggest powers, Berlin and Paris, have both shamelessly kowtowed to Putin, as Russian forces have massed on the border with Ukraine. While the new German government has bent over backwards to appease Moscow, and refuses to support tougher sanctions and the shipment of defensive weapons to Ukraine, the French are now talking about the EU forming a security pact with the Russians, threatening to split the Nato alliance down the middle.In contrast, Boris Johnson’s administration has been at the forefront of arming Ukraine, calling the Russians out on their plans to install a puppet government in Kiev, and urging the free world to unite in the face of Russian aggression. This is real leadership at a time when much of Europe is either paralysed over Ukraine, or actively appeasing the Russian bear.And there is hope in Congress and in Washington’s influential think tanks that the British approach may help stiffen the spine as well of the Biden administration. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has been tougher and more vocal in warning the Kremlin of the consequences of invading Ukraine than her US counterpart Anthony Blinken. And Downing Street’s unequivocal messaging on the Russian threat has been significantly more robust than President Biden’s bizarre talk last week of a possible “minor incursion” by the Russians in Ukraine, which was loudly attacked by the Ukrainian government.Freed of the shackles of Brussels, Brexit Britain is a force to be reckoned with on the world stage. With a renewed sense of confidence, and a determination to strengthen Nato and the transatlantic alliance, the British are leading again. At a time when American leadership is in retreat following the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, and European leaders are projecting weakness and ision, Great Britain is standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine as they face the prospect of invasion and occupation by a brutal aggressor.My former boss Margaret Thatcher would have applauded the stance her nation is taking today, as a pillar of freedom in Europe, supporting the sovereignty and self-determination of a fellow ally.Nile Gardiner is the Director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation.More from NewsUkraine crisis: Joe Biden prepares troops to face down Russian invasion threatJoe Biden calls Fox News reporter a \u0026#39stupid son of a b****\u0026#39US puts 8,500 troops on \u0026#39heightened alert\u0026#39 to deploy to Europe if Russia invades UkraineAt least six dead in Afcon stampede at Cameroon Comoros matchSajid Javid set to face questions over Nusrat Ghani ‘Muslimness’ sackingUkraine exposes just how weakMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron has forgotten frances allies","story":"More from NewsUkraine crisis: Joe Biden prepares troops to face down Russian invasion threatJoe Biden calls Fox News reporter a \u0026#39stupid son of a b****\u0026#39US puts 8,500 troops on \u0026#39heightened alert\u0026#39 to deploy to Europe if Russia invades UkraineAt least six dead in Afcon stampede at Cameroon Comoros matchSajid Javid set to face questions over Nusrat Ghani ‘Muslimness’ sackingUkraine exposes just how weakMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"groundhog day nicola sturgeons scotland except no one laughing","story":"Welcome to Groundhog Day, Scotland style. Just like the cynical weatherman played by Bill Murray in the 1993 classic comedy, we in Caledonia are stranded in a never-ending cycle. Instead of being woken at the same time every day by the strains of I Got You Babe playing on the radio, we emerge from sleep each morning to hear the news headline that the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has launched a consultation on a second independence referendum.Ever since promising that the 2014 referendum would be a “once in a generation opportunity”, the SNP leader has been in danger of succumbing to repetitive strain injury, so frequently has she promised to deliver on a rerun of that vote. First there was the public consultation on ‘indyref2’ that Sturgeon promised in her October 2016 speech to SNP conference. She told perpetually excited delegates: “I am determined that Scotland will have the ability to reconsider the question of independence and to do so before the UK leaves the EU – if that is necessary to protect our country\u0027s interests.“So, I can confirm today that the Independence Referendum Bill will be published for consultation next week.”This was followed by the sound of tumbleweed blowing eerily across the Scottish political landscape.Until March 2017, that is, when the Scottish Parliament voted for another referendum, giving Sturgeon and her ministers all the authority they said they required to seek the approval of the people for independence. Then there was silence for a while, and a few frustrated SNP activists started to wonder if the Scottish Government was being entirely straight with them. Then, just before the pandemic hit, in January 2020, Holyrood voted again for a referendum, days before Britain (including Scotland) left the European Union.And yesterday, Sturgeon took to the airwaves to dust off her old soundbites from 2016, 2017 and 2020, despite the fact that the UK government, whose approval is required for any such referendum to go ahead, has not budged a millimetre from its opposition to it.From her own narrow political perspective, Sturgeon is right to raise the prospect of another referendum. In fact, she has no choice but to do so. An SNP administration in Edinburgh that acquiesces to the democratically expressed will of the Scottish people, a government that followed through on its initial promise to respect the result of the 2014 referendum, is a government that would be fiercely opposed by the SNP itself. Nationalists did not sign up to membership of the party in order to fail miserably on school standards, or to build hospitals that pose a mortal threat to their patients, to lead a farcical procurement process to build new ferries or to fail to deliver on a promise to set up a publicly-owned energy company, at a cost of billions of pounds of lost revenue. I mean, that might have been part of it, but their primary goal has always been independence, nothing less.Sturgeon knows and accepts the political and constitutional reality that, faced with continued obstinacy in London, she cannot deliver on the one thing her activists truly want. No doubt she regrets this, but it is fascinating to note that whenever an SNP spokesperson is challenged on this fundamental point, they use a form of the same words each time: “It would be unacceptable if the Westminster government refused to concede to the democratic will of the Scottish people.”This is ironic, since the SNP’s insistence on a second referendum is fundamentally a denial of Scots’ right to have the 2014 referendum result respected. But as noted above, Sturgeon cannot do anything other than to pretend that a referendum is on its way. Were she to utter the truth, she would be guaranteed to lose control of her party and her activists, who do not share her legal or political analysis of the limits of Holyrood’s powers.So the question is not whether there will be another official referendum in the near future there won’t be. The more urgent question is: for how much longer will the SNP give Nicola Sturgeon the benefit of the doubt?She and her ministers have promised the end of the next year as the point by which another vote will have been held. When that date rolls around, Sturgeon will either have to come up with a persuasive explanation as to why people need to be just a little more patient, or she will have to be honest about the Scottish Government’s legal inability to legislate for a referendum.Given that her party actually supported the Scotland Act when it was making its way through parliament in 1998, it is hardly credible that they are unaware of the measures contained within it. Yet still they want to — in fact they need to — pretend otherwise.So here’s the bottom line: if it’s up to Holyrood and not Westminster to decide on another referendum, why didn’t it go ahead with one in 2016, 2017, 2018 or 2019? Most of us know the answer. Sturgeon knows the answer. When will she be straight with the Scottish public?More from NewsUkraine crisis: Joe Biden prepares troops to face down Russian invasion threatJoe Biden calls Fox News reporter a \u0026#39stupid son of a b****\u0026#39US puts 8,500 troops on \u0026#39heightened alert\u0026#39 to deploy to Europe if Russia invades UkraineAt least six dead in Afcon stampede at Cameroon Comoros matchSajid Javid set to face questions over Nusrat Ghani ‘Muslimness’ sackingUkraine exposes just how weakMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"platinum jubilee glasses sell within hours going online","story":"If you want to raise a glass to Her Majesty on her Platinum Jubilee this year, you will have to be quick.Official Royal Collection merchandise is already selling out, with a limited edition set of champagne saucers out of stock hours after being advertised to shoppers.The £120 glasses, engraved with the EIIR cipher and olive branch emblem of the Platinum Jubilee, were sold in pairs, with only 70 available to represent each of the Queen’s years on the throne. They were the first of the limited edition ranges to be sold online only, selling out on Friday when they were promoted to the Royal Collection Trust’s subscribers.A limited edition of 1,000 Platinum Jubilee pillbox clocks costing £125 has also sold out, along with a £25 coffee mug, a £40 tankard and £65 teacup and saucer.There is an online waiting list for a tea towel costing £9.95, “inspired by the purple Robe of Estate worn by The Queen at her Coronation”.The Platinum Jubilee range is in a deep purple colour, with a coat of arms with the national emblems of the United Kingdom - roses, shamrocks, thistles and daffodils - surrounded by golden olive leaves and ears of wheat to symbolise peace and plenty.

At present they are excluded from using it, curbing their ability to easily prove their vaccine status.Writing in The , Mr Shapps said the changes - to take effect from February 11 at 4am - meant Britain was “back and open for business” with “one of the most open travel sectors in the world.”Holiday companies last night braced for a surge in demand. Bookings to all holiday destinations have already jumped by 67 per cent on average compared to December 2021, according to analysts Skyscanner.Mr Shapps said the Government would move away from “blanket border measures” and instead replace tests and quarantine with a “more sophisticated and targeted surveillance system.”He said tests for the fully-vaccinated had “outlived their usefulness,” while the time had also come to review the travel restrictions for the unvaccinated as they had remained unchanged since last March.All travellers will still have to fill in passenger locator forms but the only difference between those with and without vaccinations will be that the unvaccinated will have to pay £80-£100 per person for their two sets of tests. Day eight tests have been scrapped.Britain will be alone in opening its borders to unvaccinated travellers from anywhere in the world. Only the EU allows unvaccinated travellers from countries within the Schengen area to enter without quarantine although they still have to test. Anyone not vaccinated from outside the zone still has to self-isolate.Mr Shapps said: This is a proportionate system that moves us a step closer to normality while maintaining vital public health protections.”He signalled that hotel quarantine will be ditched as a policy and instead replaced with self-isolation at home if the Government is forced to re-introduce a red list for countries with new more potent variants.Ministers are considering changing fully-vaccinated status to include a third or booster jab, although they have not set a timescale. However, Mr Shapps warned that many other countries were already introducing such requirements, as he urged people to “get boosted.”The changes were widely welcomed by Tory and Labour MPs. Huw Merriman, the chairman of the Commons transport committee, said families should feel confident to book holidays “with certainty,” and demanded a new “culture across Whitehall” that should not again “be made an example of.”By Grant Shapps, Secretary of State for TransportFor two long years Britons travelling abroad have had to contend with a host of restrictions and test requirements resulting in lost time and money. Families have been separated, holidays scuppered, business meetings cancelled, and airlines, airports and tour operators starved of revenue.That these measures have been vital in safeguarding the nation’s health in the face of a pandemic unprecedented in our lifetimes has not made this ordeal any easier. This Government has poured billions into supporting our threatened travel sector – a world leader before Covid – but the pain has been real and long-lasting.So, it gave me enormous satisfaction to announce to the House of Commons on Monday that we are scrapping all tests for inbound vaccinated passengers and reducing test requirements for the unvaccinated, while at the same time removing the self-isolation requirement for the latter. For vaccinated travellers, this coming half-term will see a return to normality not witnessed since early 2020, with remaining tests scrapped and bureaucracy reduced to the bare minimum.The Prime Minister and I have always believed that Covid restrictions on travel should last not a minute longer than is necessary. A Conservative government must maintain personal freedom as its core value – we should never become addicted to bureaucratic restraints on free movement and free trade. And now, with our vaccination programme proof against omicron and our genome surveillance capability safeguarding us against new variants, we can remove the last shackles to international travel. We can set Britons free.At every stage in our journey back to pre-Covid travel we have assessed the data, weighed the risks and charted a path balancing health security with the need to minimise the economic shock to some of our flagship industries. You don’t win any popularity contests trying to do this, I can tell you. But it comes with the territory.At the end of January 2020, we advised against all but essential travel to China, following the initial pandemic outbreak, and our measures escalated as the virus did, with flight bans, self-isolation, quarantine hotels and, of course, an array of testing.Fast-forward to the present day, and the tough choices taken, together with foresight shown in pushing forward vaccine development and uptake, have left us in a very different position. We have managed to turn the tide on the virus and get ourselves to a position that was impossible even two months ago, when the virulence of omicron was unknown.Covid can always spring another surprise – we have learned that to our cost. But we are now building momentum towards a post-pandemic world, in which we live with Covid much as we live with other endemic diseases. Life must go on.And we are already reaping the benefits of our newfound, post-Brexit agility as a nation. Our vaccination programme has allowed us to enjoy one of the most open societies in Europe, resulting in GDP growth that is outstripping our G7 partners. We have delivered a staggering 137 million jabs in order to achieve this, and we need to guard against any future resurgence of Covid by getting our boosters now. Remember, while we in Britain have not yet made a booster a condition of test-free travel, other countries have or will.

But the reasons he gave for his resignation matter to you and your family’s budget. Because it involves £. billion of taxpayers’ money, lost by the government to fraud. Frittered away – and now in the hands of criminals and gangs. Asked by Labour about the amount of money lost to fraud in the Government’s Covid schemes, Lord Agnew couldn’t justy that loss any longer. He no longer defended the lack of checks to prevent fraud to the public purse.  Of course there was pressure to get help to people and businesses quickly. But it shouldn’t be beyond the wit of government – the stewards of taxpayers’ hard earned cash – to get money where it needs to without losing billions to criminals. Instead Lord Agnew rounded on the Government’s handling of the affair describing it as “woefully inadequate” and “inexcusable” and characterised by a combination of “arrogance and indolence”. He blasted the loans given to companies with no record of trading and the duplicate loans given to companies. This matters because a government guarantee means taxpayers like you will be lumped with the costs.But it also matters because there is a growing cost of living crisis. One that is only going to get worse when the Conservativesapos tax hikes hit in April. We’ve been told these tax rises are needed to pay for health and social care. Yet the Government’s own Minister said yesterday that tackling this fraud was worth p off income taxthe Government could rouse itself to do it. Coming on top of billions spent on crony contracts, this enormous waste destroys any claim the Conservatives have to careful stewardship of the public finances. Value for money still matters. And it matters more when the Chancellor – the Minister for Fraud himself – tells the public you have to pay more taxes to meet the bills. Bills that Labour has a plan to keep low, with our plan to save households £ as energy prices soar. Lord Agnew’s resignation is another reminder that the Chancellor must take responsibility for the level of waste and fraud which has happened on his watch. And he shouldn’t continue to hide while asking the British people to pay the price.

Sir Graham Brady, chair of the all-important  Committee made up of Tory backbenchers, has not yet received the magical  letters that would trigger a vote of no confidence. Political pundits believe many Tories are now awaiting the results of the Gray investigation before deciding whether or not to pull that trigger. Johnsonaposs alleged contempt for the rules put in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus over the past two years has caused anger throughout the nation.In response to the frustration - which stems from millions of Brits making huge sacrices, including not being able to be with elderly loved ones - an investigation has been launched into the string of gatherings. At the helm of investigation sits Sue Gray, the most powerful person youaposve never heard of.Who is Sue Gray   Senior civil servant Sue Gray served as Director General of Propriety and Ethics in the Cabinet Office between  and .Before this, she worked in the departments of Transport, Health and Work and Pensions. After these roles, she took a career break in the late s to run a pub in Northern Ireland before joining the Cabinet Office in the s.She now holds the role of the Second Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Office, a role charged with leading on the Union and the Constitution.When is the Sue Gray report into Downing Street party allegations due   The report is now expected to be finalised this week- the exact date remains to be confirmed. The is some chatter the reports could come as early as Tuesday, although later in the week is more likely. The report was originally due to be completed last week but was extended as fresh evidence emerged. PM Johnson confirmed the report is expected this week during his embattled PMQs on January . The reason no one has any hard and fast answers about the reportaposs release date stems from the additional revelations cropping up about more parties alleged to have taken place. What does the Sue Gray investigation cover   The primary purpose of Grayaposs report is, according to the Cabinet Office, to: Establish swtly a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings, including attendance, the setting and the purpose, with reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time.The scope of the report initially set out to cover the Downing Street Christmas parties on November  and December , but the number of dates under the microscope has now been extended to include two parties that took place on the night before Prince Philipaposs funeral on April . According to the terms of reference set out for the investigation: Where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be investigated.They also state that: If required, the investigations will establish whether inidual disciplinary action is warranted. The terms set out that investigators will have access to documents and will be able to speak to staff throughout its course. Grayaposs investigation will now include an interview with Johnsonaposs former aide Dominic Cummins over the claims he made that that the PM lied to Parliament.On Monday January  it emerged that Cummins refused to speak to Sue Gray in person for fear his former boss would try to discredit him, answering only in writing. Speaking to his Substack page subscribers, he said his old boss would invent nonsense and has instead given an account in writing, although he did claim there would be more damaging stories to come about Johnson. It has also emerged that, according to the , Downing Street police officers have provided testimonies to the report, with one source telling the paper they were extremely damning and are set to be an important part of Grayaposs report.Is the Sue Gray investigation independent  One key concern remains, however, about the independence of the investigation. This is because despite being at the heart of Grayaposs explorations, Boris Johnson is also the person who gets to decidethe next stage of the investigation can actually go ahead.He can also choose when to make the findings public. After Grayaposs report, Johnson will have the final say as to whether the Prime Minister’s advisor on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, can actually start an investigation into any breaches of ministerial code. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: “The PM has set the terms of Sue Gray’s probe and he has chosen to exclude the conduct of ministers from it, creating a neat loophole for himself.“Any judgement on the conduct of Boris Johnson goes to... Boris Johnson.  “A farcical circular process from a Prime Minister that will escape responsibility in any way he can. However, concerns have also been raised about whether the report will be published in full.Speaking on BBC Radio aposs Today Programme, the education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: So the terms of reference for Sue Gray’s report is that the findings of her report will be made public, and the prime minister has pledged he will come to parliament to then make a statement and be scrutinised by colleagues on the findings of that report.” But when askedthis specically meant that only the findings of the report and not the whole thing would be published, he said: “The findings of Sue Gray’s report will be made public – that is the terms of reference. I think that will ensure public confidence. She can follow the evidence wherever it takes her, and she’s doing exactly that.” Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab was asked the same question by the BBC on January . He said: Quite the way, the process for it, will be for the prime minister to decide. But … there will be full transparency. He has said he will come back to the Commons and make a statement, so there will be full scrutiny.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonPoliticsDowning Street partyDowning Street Christmas Party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The terrible tales we tell today of people struggling to make ends meet are before April’s rocketing fuel bills start accelerate beyond recent rises, tightening the financial screw on people already struggling to stretch incomes to cover higher living costs. The year of the squeeze, , will force more folk to choose between eating and heating as poverty kills men and women in one of the earth’s richest countries. It doesn’t have to be this way. It’s a choice by the Conservative Government. And it’s a scandal that must be challenged, forcing the Tories into another U-turn – this time suspending VAT on energy bills, giving extra help to low earners and cancelling a hefty National Insurance tax rise.  Dignied, heroic Jack Mortimer and the others deserve our support. Out the bigots The sickening bigotry, prejudice and racism within the Conservative Party exposed by MP and sacked Minister Nusrat Ghani’s explosive claim her Muslim religion was why she was sacked from Boris Johnson’s Government is utterly repellent. Deep nauseating schisms exposed in the Tories by the unacceptable discrimination, Health and Education Secretaries Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi speaking in support of Ghani while Downing Street and loyal backbencher Michael Fabricant add insults to injury, mustn’t be ignored.  This ugly scandal cannot be dealt with by the Conservative Party or Parliament. The Equality and Human Rights Commission must launch a formal inquiry into evidence that bigotry against Muslims is unlawfully polluting the governing party. Human writes Being able to read, write and count – what are confusingly known as the three Rs- are essential to live an enjoyable, interesting and rewarding le so the number of pupils going to secondary school struggling to understand even simple words and sentences is dispiriting. Improving the nation’s literacy so no child falls behind is a noble endeavour deserving more than lip service from politicians otherwise plunging disadvantaged families deeper into hardship.

Ex-health minister Steve Brine made £-an-hour giving aposstrategic adviceapos to drug firm Sigma without first checking with the Advisory Body on Business Appointments .And last February, Mr Brine arranged a meeting between Sigma and then-Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Two months later, the firm was awarded a £, government contract to supply Covid- tests to pharmacies.Mr Brine claimed to have consulted revolving door watchdog about all of his outside jobs.  But an investigation by the Sunday Mirror discovered he had not consulted them over a £, role giving strategic advice to Sigma pharmaceuticals until after he took the job - an apparent breach of the ministerial code. But both the firm and Mr Brine deny he acted as a lobbyist, and insist he played no role in the deal. But ACOBA chair Lord Pickles, said there was a reasonable concern that his contact with Mr Zahawi was only made available to Sigma as a direct result of Mr Brineaposs time as a minister at the Department for Health and Social Care  He added: I do not consider it was in-keeping with the letter or the spirit of the governmentaposs rules for former ministers for a former minister at DHSC to contact a minister with responsibilities for health on behalf of a pharmaceutical company which pays him.Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: From the revolving door to crony contracts, the scandals just keep mounting for a Conservative Party mired in sleaze from the Prime Minister down. Even the governmentaposs in house committee is increasingly concerned about the behaviour of former Tory ministers and has called on them to act.Labour will ban ministers for at least five years after they leave office and create a genuinely independent watchdog to enforce the rules, ending the days that Tory politicians could profit from privileged access, information and taxpayersapos money. Enough is enough.In a letter to Cabinet Office minister Steve Brine about the case, Lord Pickles added: I am growing increasingly concerned that not all former Ministers of the Crown are sufficiently clear on the ious standards of behaviour, rules and legislation that are incumbent on them. He added: It is now a matter for you to decide what appropriate action to take. Acoba has no power to impose punishments on ministers or former ministers who break the rules. Former Ministers have to consult ACOBA before taking any job within two years of leaving government. The Sunday Mirror revealed last month that Mr Brine had only contacted the body after he had started working for Sigma. The Ministerial Code states: “Former Ministers must ensure that no new appointments are announced, or taken up, before the Committee has been able to provide its advice.” And ACOBA’s guidance for former ministers states: “A retrospective application is one where an appointment or employment has been taken up or announced before the Committee has provided its full and final advice. “This is a breach of the government’s Rules.” There’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of Sigma. Lord Pickles handed Mr Brineaposs case to the Cabinet Office to decide what -any - punishment he should receive. In a letter to Lord Pickles, Mr Brine said his failure to consult ACOBA before starting the job was an error and apologised for poor admin on my part. He admitted personally arranging for Mr Zahawi to attend the meeting with Sigma, but denied he was using his contacts to influence Government policy or secure business for the firm. Mr Brine quietly quit the job with Sigma in November, after the Prime Minister vowed to ban MPs from exploiting their positions with consultancy jobs. He has since resigned from two further consultancy jobs - each worth £, a year.

But what does this really mean, whats going and whats staying Johnson has made a major announcement this week, as he removed the Plan B restrictions Image: PAByHarry ThompsonTrends Writer:,  Jan | commentsPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced some popular policies among the Tory backbenchers last week when he revealed the governmentaposs Covid exit strategy from Plan B.The announcement, which came in the middle of strong calls from both sides of the aisle for the Prime Minister to resign amid the Partygate scandal, was met with cheers from some members of the house. Speaking on Wednesday January , Johnson said: Today’s latest ONS data show clearly that infection levels are falling in England.And while there are some places where cases are likely to continue rising, including in primary schools – our scientists believe it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally.He added: Hospital admissions which were doubling every nine days just two weeks ago – have now stabilised, with admissions in London even falling. And the numbers in intensive care not only remain low but are actually also falling. So this morning, the Cabinet concluded that because of the extraordinary booster campaign together with the way the public have responded to the Plan B measures - we canto Plan A in England and allow Plan B regulations to expire. What is Covid Plan A   Plan A largely refers to the restrictions that were in place before the spread of the Omicron iant. This means that many of the rules relating to Plan B are due to be scrapped. These are:Mandatory mask-wearing in school and public places Mandatory Covid passports for large venues Official work from home adviceDuring his speech on Wednesday, Johnson said: As weto Plan A, the House will know that some measures still remain, including those on self-isolation. In particular, it is still a legal requirement for those who have tested positive for Covid to self-isolate.On Monday we reduced the isolation period to five full days with two negative tests.At the time of writing, UK travel laws remain unchanged by the announcement of theof Plan A. People will be able to visit care homes under the new restrictions. When do plan B Covid restrictions end   During his speech to the Commons, the PM broke down the ious days that parts of Plan B would be brought to a halt. He said: From the start of Thursday next week mandatory certication will end, referring to the need for Covid passports when entering large venues.He did however add that: Organisations can, of course, choose to use the NHS Covid Pass voluntarily but we will end the compulsory use of Covid status certication in England.From now, the government is no longer asking people to work from home and people should now speak to their employers about arrangements for ing to the office. And having looked at the data carefully, the Cabinet concluded that once regulations lapse, the government will no longer mandate the wearing of face masks anywhere. The regulation lapse date he referred to is this Wednesday, January . The Prime Minister also dropped the need for school children to wear masks sooner than the rest of society, saying: From tomorrow, we will no longer require face masks in classrooms, and the Department for Education will shortly remove national guidance on their use in communal areas. In the country at large, we will continue to suggest the use of face coverings in enclosed or crowded places, particularly where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet.

She said: “My miscarriages started when I was just a teenager and I went on to have  of them over the years -all before nine weeks. It was absolutely crushing. But after meeting her husband Joe, , Emmaaposs mind was changed, and she gave pregnancy another go. “I met Joe and he told me straight away he wanted children. I told him no. But then about two weeks later I was so happy, in love and comfortable that all I could think was give me babies!” But Emma, from Kirkby, was once again left devastated after falling pregnant and miscarrying twice. Then, in late , Emma fell pregnant again - this time with twins. But on her birthday, she discovered sheaposd miscarried again at six weeks.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here She said: After I’d lost the twins I knew that was it. I just couldn’t do it again. Joe completely understood. By pure chance and without trying, Emma found out she was pregnant again just a month later. While she was over the moon, she was terried this pregnancy would end in tragedy again. She recalled: I’d check the toilet every time I went. I was scared to use it, scared to cough, scared of any ache or pain.When she began bleeding and shaking uncontrollably at six weeks in, Emma had familiar feeling and was convinced she had miscarried.She was rushed to Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital for tests and told tofor a scan two days later.Emma said:I got in there, lay down and the sonographer didn’t turn the screen around. I’d been in so many times before and I knew it meant more bad news.  As staff rushed around her, Emma was told she was having an ectopic pregnancy - which is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside the womb.I was told I’d have to have one of my fallopian tubes removed, she said.But after waking up from the operation, Emma learned her pregnancy was normal - and sheaposd simply had a blockage in one of her fallopian tubes. A few days later, a scan revealed another surprise - Emma was carrying quads.Emma said: “I was stunned. I still couldn’t believe it as I was taken off to see a specialist in multiple pregnancies.She walked in and said, ‘So, four babies.’ She showed me another scan image and there they were - four tiny blobs.”However, Emma and Joeaposs joy was short lived when Emma started to bleed heavily at nine weeks. Then a few days later, she stood up and felt something fall out. After being rushed to hospital, doctors confirmed her worst fears - there were no signs of pregnancy.Emma said: I was told it looked like I’d passed the pregnancy. I knew they were right, as I’d seen the babies with my own eyes. I knew they’d gone. After sharing her heartbreak in a Facebook post, a woman approached Emma and offered to be her surrogate.But a few weeks later, she had a dream in which her late grandad, David, appeared and told her she was still pregnant. Emma said: I woke up with a start. My grandad died when I was four and I never have those kinds of dreams.I grabbed a doppler I had on top of the cupboard, held it to my stomach and listened. Sure enough – there was a whooshing sound.Despite Joe’s scepticism, Emma headed to hospital and insisted on being scanned.She said: They must have thought I was mad. I’d been marked down as having lost the babies and there I was, hysterical and crying, saying, aposI’ve had a dream. I’m still pregnantapos.Sure enough, a scan showed Emma was still pregnant with two babies.In an incredibly rare phenomenon, Emma’s quads – two sets of identical twins – had suffered a condition called vanishing twin syndrome twice over.The condition happens when one of a set of twins dies in the uterus and the embryos are normally then reabsorbed into the body.In Emma’s case, she had lost one from each set of identical twins – leaving her with two non-identical twins – and had passed the embryos.Astonished at the news and already  weeks pregnant, she headed home to tell a shell-shocked Joe. From there, Emma described her pregnancy as amazing and was induced at  weeks to give birth to Aurora Azalea, lbs oz, and Ophelia Lili, lbs oz, on  October last year.Emma said: I love being a twin mum. It’s not for everyone, but I cherish every single day. It still feels like a miracle even now the girls are three months old. She added: I just want all the women out there to know thereaposs no shame in it. There are so many of us suffering, thinking weaposre made, terried every time we get pregnant. I hope my story can give some hope.Professor Luciano Nardo, Founder and CEO of NOW-fertility explained what vanishing twin syndrome is.He said: Vanishing twin syndrome is an early pregnancy condition in which one of a set of twins disappears as result of being reabsorbed within the uterine cavity.

Plan B measures, meanwhile, expire on January , after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs government already removed restrictions on the wearing of masks in the classroom and ended work-from-home guidance.The end of Plan B has no bearing on rules for self-isolating, though, which has also seen a big change in recent weeks.The period recently saw a cut in the hope that this would address a shortage in NHS staff and teachers.So what are the current rules regarding self-isolation  What are the current rules for self-isolating   People should already begin isolating once they feel they have one of the three following symptoms:a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste People are recommended to isolatethey have other symptoms as the Omicron iant can appear in people in ious ways. The important thing is to take a test as soon as possible after possible symptoms appear.People are only free from isolation after five full days, so day six after testing, and can only leave quarantinethey test negative on a daily lateral flow test twice consecutively. If you live in the same household as someone with Covid-, you must self-isolate unless you meet one of the following criteria: You are fully vaccinatedYou are under the age of  You are taking part in an approved vaccine trial You are exempt for medical reasonsWhen do self-isolation rules change   The current self-isolation rules in England are now in place until March . The PM has indicated that the government does not expect self-isolation rules to continue past this point. If the data allows for it, the government will also look at scrapping the rules before the deadline.  In the House of Commons, Johnson said: The self-isolation regulations expire on March , at which point I very much expect not to renew them. Indeed were the data to allow, I would like to seek a vote in this House to bring that date forwards. In advance of that, we will set out our long-term strategy for living with Covid-. What to doyou test positive for Covid  According to the NHS, you only need to confirm a positive LFT with a PCR :youaposre applying for a Test and Trace Support Paymentyouaposre eligible for new Covid- treatments youaposre asked to do so as part of research you have a positive rapid lateral flow test on or before day  of arriving in England from outside the UK You can report your positive LFT on the government website, here. Once a person tests positive through a lateral flow test, they must begin isolating for five full days. If you are in the same household as someone, you can reduce the spread of the virus by keeping away from them, keeping shared spaces well-ventilated, surfaces clean and your hands regularly washed.

It has been awarded an official Certicate of Airworthiness by the Slovak Transport Authority in tests compatible with the European Aviation Safety Agency, meaning it can be flown in EU nations.And there are plans to make it a regular sight in the skies for London to Paris trips, allowing a pilot and passenger to roll off the runway and on to the road. Developed by Slovakian company Klein Vision, it took eight skilled specialists more than , hours to convert design drawings for AirCar into reality. The car-o-plane has completed  hours of flight tests with  takeoffs and landings to be cleared by authorities.  It will now go into production with a launch expected in a year’s time, although there is no price tag yet for the dual-mode vehicle. Sensational footage shows it soaring through the air and then landing and hitting the road looking like a souped-up sports car with a massive spoiler at the back.  The two seater AirCar has a single propellor, uses a BMW engine and can reach a height of ,ft and speeds of mph. Inventor and test pilot Professor Stefan Klein said: “AirCar certication opens the door for mass production of very efficient flying cars.  “It is official and the final confirmation of our ability to change mid-distance travel forever.” Project co-founder Anton Zajac added: “AirCar expands those frontiers, by taking us into the next dimension, where road meets sky. We do have plans to fly to London from Paris in the near future.”  The Slovak Transport Authority said the road-to-air vehicle had been rigorously tested with safety at the heart of the checks. Its director Rene Molnar said: “The transportation safety is our highest priority. “It defines a new category of a sports car and a reliable aircraft. Its certication was both a challenging and fascinating task.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON European UnionBMWCars\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rules masks passes planb","story":"Covid rules end this week – exact dates for masks, Covid Pass and what will changeThe government plans to lt a substantial portion of its Covid measures this week as the UK prepares for the virus to become endemic, meaning the virus may still be present but isnt a concern and isnt expected to be disruptivethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video sajid-javid-says-uk-should-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:UbwnVx,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Others, however, will be less enthusiastic about the upcoming changes - with many of the countryaposs vulnerable still forced to shield from the virus. But what does the governmentaposs exit strategy from Plan B actually include, and when will the ious rule changes be coming into effect  Thursday, January   Two key changes are planned to come into place this Thursday. Face masks indoors People have had to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings - including public transport - since the introduction of Plan B in December, but as of Thursday this will no longer be a legal requirement. All kinds of indoor facilities have required the wearing of masks inside, from cinemas and theatres to indoor sports facilities and shops. The government does however still recommend people wear face coverings in crowded places, especially when filled with strangers. NHS Covid passes Indoor venues of more than  people like nightclubs and other late-night venues - as well as outdoor events for more than , people - have all needed an NHS Covid pass to be shown upon entry. The same has gone for any event with over , attendees.As of Thursday this is no longer going to be a legal requirement, although venues can use their own discretion and request entrants show a passthat is their preferred policy. The introduction of the law in the first place was controversial, with a -strong Tory revolt taking place at the time, leading to substantial pressure ever since for the Prime Minister to do away with the measure. Rules already changed Work from home guidance, which has dominated the working lives of many since well before Christmas, was lted last week. This was brought to an end when the official government advice for people living in England to work from home wherever possible was officially lted, with Johnson encouraging people to get in touch with their employers to discuss the next steps for ing to workplaces and offices. Ahead of the general end to mandatory mask-wearing, last Thursday also saw an end to school children needing to wear masks in classrooms with them having worn them since coming back to school after Christmas. Some rules remain The latest announcement last week saw no change to rules around travel to the UK, with people still needing to take a test within  hours of theirto the UK. There is also no change to the legal requirement to isolate for at least five daysyou test positive for the virus. The minimum time people needed to isolate has recently been shortened drastically, with people no longer needing to stay home for the full  daystheytwo negative lateral flow tests on two consecutive days after the fth day of isolation.

Currys say their investigation into the incident confirmed aposJordanapos - a name the driver made up - breached their code of conduct and heaposs been sacked by their delivery partner.Since social media posts by Kaceyaposs partner Ryan Sagar went viral, another woman - Jessica Hickling - has come forward to claim she was targeted by the same man after delivering a fridge freezer on December .Jessica, , was left unsettled when Jordan kept smiling at her and askedshe lived alone, before sending messages after leaving askingshe liked her new fridge andhe could keep her number. She now fears Jordan knows her phone number and address after using Currys like Tinder. Jessica, from Newsome, West Yorks., said:I thought he was helpful but after I got the message I thought it was a bit creepy he went out of his way to help me. He askedI live here on my own and I thought that was a weird thing to ask. I told him aposno, with my son, but heaposs at his dadapossapos. It was strange. I didnapost think too much of it but when I saw the text message, it creeped me out because heaposs been in my house and knows where I live. Heaposs now got my number and knows I live on my own as well. When I got the text, straight away I thought nobody  knew Iaposd had the fridge delivered so it had to be him sending the message. Itaposs worrying because thereaposs a possibility he could come back. But Jordan has since complained he was set up by Kacey and that the messages have destroyed his relationship.  Jordan said: Iaposve got a bird. My relationshipaposs been destroyed over this. Iaposve lost everything overnight. Iaposve been set up. Iaposve gone to this young girlaposs house in Bradford and obviously, sheaposs wanted it. Sheaposs been flaunting it. We put two items in her house and she askedwe were down for installation and I said no, then she askedI could come back after work and install it, but I said aposno, not reallyapos. I got in the van and I told my mate what she said, and he told me to message her this and that. So I started messaging her and we made up the name [Jordan]. She definitely wanted me to get in touch. She wanted it. She was begging for it. How did she expect me to come back after workI didnapost have the number to contact her  My girlfriendaposs seen it and obviously itaposs not good. I said it was a laugh with the lads in the van, but sheaposs not forgiven me yet. If she wasnapost flaunting it like that, I wouldnapost need to [text her].  Ryan, , made headlines last week after his texts posing as Kacey went viral. Jordan bragged about earning £, in the messages and claimed he could be Kaceyaposs apossugar daddyapos. Ryan then revealed himself and complained to Currys. Kacey, from Bradford, West Yorks., said: Ryanaposs dadaposs a plumber and heaposs renovated the house from as old as it can be to brand new, so I wouldnapost need him to do it. I canapost believe it. Heaposs disgusting, that guy. I canapost believe heaposs got the cheek to sit and say that. Maybe this is what heaposs said to his girlfriend to win her back. I feel sorry for her. I literally had a beige jumper on and leggings, so I couldnapost have been more dressedIaposd have tried. Heaposs obviously a creep. I couldnapost care less what he says. The fact heaposs gone into another girlaposs house and done the same thing, that just says it all. When asked about his texts to Jessica, Jordan said: I worked with someone dferent then. It was me messaging but it was a laugh. We were just messing about in the van as lads do. Nobodyaposs saying that itaposs alright. It is what it is. I wouldnapost do it again. I wasnapost trying to make them uncomfortable. Currys have confirmed Jordan was working for a delivery partner contracted to drop off their products and theyaposve sought to reassure customers drivers will face the sackthey breach their conduct rules. A Currys spokesperson said: We were very concerned to learn of the experiences of Ms Wheeler and Ms Hickling. Weaposre directly in contact with them and our immediate priority is to ensure their concerns are addressed. We recognise the privilege and responsibility that comes with delivering to our customersapos homes and we expect all delivery crews, including our delivery partners, to treat our customers with the utmost respect.

Ronnie Kermanaposs parents were warned they might lose their son after doctors confirmed he had suffered a stroke. Mum Louise immediately knew something was wrong when she found the tot unconscious in his crib in February . She would usually be greeted by the sight of Ronnie, who has a twin brother named Robert, standing at the edge of his bed waiting to be picked up.But this time, he was laying on his back with the left-side of his body aposall floppyapos, reports Hull Live.Louise and dad Phil rushed him to Hull Royal Infirmary and a CT scan revealed a black mark on the -month-old toddleraposs brain. The couple were then urged to take Ronnie to Leeds General Infirmary for treatment.  Ronnie was diagnosed with an Optic Pathway Glioman and Neurofibromatosis Type , which caused Ronnie to become completely blind. He has also since been diagnosed with Moyamoya disease which is caused by a blocked artery in the brain. The brave tot underwent several brain surgeries for the cancerous tumour inside his brain in  and . After a promising response at first, things took a sharp turn when Ronnie became allergic to his chemotherapy and his parents were told to prepare for end of le care. Phil said: When the doctors spoke about palliative care, I just couldnapost believe it. I was really shocked because Ronnie had been doing so well and we were told the tumour on his brain had shrunk. But the tumour had grown a little bit and they said there was nothing  they could do. I just said to the doctor aposyouaposve got to do something, youaposve got to help him and save his leapos. Doctors then put Ronnie on a daily chemotherapy treatment called Trametinib which he can take orally. He is the youngest patient to have been administered the treatment. Phil said the treatment has been absolutely fantastic and Ronnie is now approaching his sixth birthday. He added: I couldnapost ask for anything more really. He is just a little superstar, we never thought it would be this way. He can even aposbum shuffleapos from the living room to the kitchen. Even though he canapost see, he knows where he is and where he needs to be. Itaposs fantastic. Ronnie has also benefited greatly from sensory play using sensory boards and playing in the water.

He lost his hearing after suffering an ear infection but has learned to respond to hand signals. Staffordshire bull terrier Rocco, seven, was initially handed into rescuers in  but was quickly rehomed with new owners. However when one of the owners died and the other became seriously unwell he ed to the Llys Nini Animal Centre in Penllergaer, near Swansea. Centre worker Sally Humphries said: His new owners were really lovely and Rocco took to them straight away.  I remember laughing at the fact he didnapost want to come and say goodbye to me when I dropped him off. He stayed by their side like heaposd known them all his le. When Rocco ed, staff learned that he was completely deaf, so they started teaching him sign language.  Sally said: He reads our hand signals and body language as a way of telling what weaposre asking for. For example, thumbs up means good boy. Most dogs are more in tune with our body language than our constant chitter chatter so itaposs not that tricky for a deaf dog to learn. Itaposs all about consistency and making sure you choose a simple sign for each behaviour that you are trying to teach, so itaposs as clear as possible for them to understand.Rocco is a wonderful example of just how resilient animals can be and proof that you can definitely teach an old dog new tricks.Staff hope the new skill will help Rocco find a forever home soon.

It was during the Nineties and he was a governor at a nearby school. We arranged to meet to discuss a story. My paper didn’t have picture bylines at the time but I knew who he was. We arranged to meet at a town hall but as I approached him a look of horror swept over his face. I stuck out a hand to introduce myself.“Hi, I’m Darren, good to meet you.” I said. “Oh,” he replied. “You don’t sound black on the phone ”The meeting didn’t last long.  I remembered it while listening to the preposterous Tory MP Michael Fabricant over the weekend. He was speaking after ex-minister Nusrat Ghani claimed she was told by party Whips that she was sacked in  because her ‘Muslimness’ made colleagues uncomfortable. Chief Whip Mark Spencer has rejected the claim as “completely ” and “defamatory”. Fabricant took to radio station LBC, saying: “I think the whole thing actually stinks. She’s hardly someone who is obviously a Muslim.”  Where to start  To dismiss blond wig-on-a-stick Fabricant as a ludicrous character Harry Enfield or Ricky Gervais would have been proud of actually allows the Lichfield MP off the hook. You can make up your own mind as to the legitimacy of Ms Ghani’s claim. It wouldn’t surprise anyone, however, that it has erupted within a party whose leader compared Muslim women to letterboxes and bank robbers. Or that Downing Street has confirmed Ms Ghani complained to Prime Minister Boris Johnson directly – two years ago.  Johnson, she claimed, urged the former junior minister to use the formal complaint process which, with this regime, is probably a bit like going to the policeyou have an issue with a colleague within the mafia. Don’t be fooled into thinking the inquiry called by Johnson on Monday morning is anything other than a welcome opportunity to keep the upcoming Partygate report from Sue Grayoff the front pages. If Johnson really does take the issue seriously, why didn’t he bang his fist on his desk and order the inquiry back then, when Ms Ghani told him  In any case the inquiry won’t be independent - even though civil servants are supposed to be. It will be conducted by the Cabinet Office – the people who work for the PM. Don’t be surprised when it turns up a nothing-to-see-here whitewash. The stag do that has been Johnson’s premiershiphas shown us a party stuck in the past. A nationalistic, flag-waving regime, replete with Benny Hill-type chancers pining for the days of the Empire and a time when you could say anything you wanted, regardless of any offence caused.

David McCreadie believes a process called dredging is behind the deadly illness which has had a devastating effect on wildle in recent months. Hundreds of pet pooches have reportedly been struck down after walks on beaches along Yorkshireaposs coast over the past few weeks. Meanwhile dead crabs and rotting lobsters have been littering the coastline between Marske and Saltburn in North Yorkshire, while piles of crustaceans have been spotted in Seaton Carew and Seaham in County Durham. Mr McCreadie said he saw a vessel dredging off Teesmouth near the North Yorkshire coast in late September.The former senior lecturer in marine biology and oceanography believes this process has released historic toxins from the bottom of the sea, reports Yorkshire Live.It comes after a fisherman reported that there are no crabs or fish for miles off Yorkshireaposs coast and that he has to survive off just £ a month.  Investigators have ruled out dredging as the cause behind these events but Mr McCreadie claims a two-week operation unearthed historic toxins off Teesmouth and the dredged material was dumped three or four miles off the coast. He has called for more samples to be taken by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsand for Government labs to test specically for cyanide and deadly dioxins. The expert, also a member of the British Divers Marine Le Rescue, has been keeping an eye on reports of dogs falling ill after walking on the beaches which some believe is linked to the piles of dead sea creatures washed up on the shores. Mr McCreadie said he is . per cent certain that the dredging operation unearthed toxins left behind from a century of dumping in the Tees river. In November , the Environment Agency rejected chemical pollution as a likely cause and investigators have said dredging, sewage and undersea cabling activity is not to blame either. More than , potential chemical contaminants have been screened and inspectors said no anomalies that could lead to an event of that scale have been found. Defra is now leading the investigation and said samples of dredged material had to meet high standards before it could be disposed of at sea. A spokesperson said Environment Agency tests on crabs and lobsters also ruled out chemical pollution.

And the bond with his dad Prince Charles is one that has especially felt the strain of late. Last year, in his bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, Harry accused his dad of cutting him off financially and not taking his calls. In addition, Harry has also appeared on the Apple TV series The Me You Canapost See, where he spoke about the royalsapos total neglect and the Armchair Expert podcast, where he lashed out at Charlesaposs parenting. And just last month, one report claimed relations between the pair were at aposrock bottomapos and that they were barely speaking. However, with the turn of the year, there have been claims of several olive branches, which appear to show that their icy relationship may be starting to thaw... Fatheraposs pride One of the first signs that Harry and Charlesapos relationship could be improving was just days into the New Year. It came in an essay that Charles wrote for Newsweek, where he issued a call for urgent action to save the environment.In the piece, he praised both Prince William and Harry for their work in raising awareness of the issue.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.Months earlier, at her speech at the Cop climate change summit in Glasgow in November, the Queen name-checked both Charles and William for their work in saving the environment, but there was no mention of Harry. However, in the essay, Charles spoke about how he was proud of both William and Harry for having recognised the threat of climate change. He said: Most recently, my elder son, William, launched the prestigious Earthshot Prize to incentivise change and help repair our planet over the next ten years by identying and investing in the technologies that can make a dference. And my younger son, Harry, has passionately highlighted the impact of climate change, especially in relation to Africa, and committed his charity to being net-zero. Enjoyable video calls Shortly after the Newsweek essay was released, the Mirror revealed that Charles had held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with Harry. Sources close to Charles said that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship. One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Missing grandchildren And not only does it appear that Charles is missing his son and daughter-in-law Meghan, he is also desperate to see their children.Charles hasnapost seen two-year-old Archie since the family moved to Calornia and he is yet to meet his seven-month-old granddaughter Lilibet. One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children. Invitation to stay Meanwhile, another olive branch Charles has extended to his youngest son is an invitation to stay with him when he and his family next visit the UK. The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood. But Charles’s good-natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation.  Harry claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. He has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court.Meanwhile, a report today suggests Charlesapos invitation comes amid fears over what Harryaposs memoir, due out this year, will say about Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.Those fears are said to revolve around Harryaposs recollections of Camillaaposs entry into the Royal Family and how her romance with his father damaged him from a young age. Secret talksHowever, itaposs also said that Harry himself reached out to his dad with the pair having secret talks to heal their rt before the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations. A royal insider told the Sun : “There has been a definite thaw in relations between Harry and Charles. They are on much better terms and have been having friendly chats and video calls.“It has been suggested to Harry he may live to regret any lingering family bitterness, and he has taken that on board. “There is a feeling he is coming back more into the fold and wants to be closer to his family.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old admits her home leaves all her visitors shivering and her family worried she’ll get pneumonia. But Diane says these are the s she has to go, to keep those rising energy bills down. The mum-of-six and gran to seven, has seen her energy bills soar by % in recent months from £ to £. Speaking from her frosty ground floor flat in Tulse Hill, South London, she said: “A neighbour came in yesterday and I noticed she was shivering. “I said ‘I’m really sorry. Let’s move into the living room’, where the temperature was not much dferent but the sun was shining in.” The Mirror is calling for VAT on energy bills to be scrapped as rocketing prices look set to push millions into poverty. Former NHS worker Diane gets £ to live on after her rent is paid from her state pension and is dreading the energy bill rises to come.“I live in the cold. My hands are freezing at the moment. Quite often my nose is cold like a dog’s. My kids are worried I will get pneumonia. “My daughters won’t bring the kids around because my house is so cold. They worry about me getting diseases or stuff too. “ Since the pandemic Diane only ventures out to get her prescriptions because she is asthmatic and has been shielding so does not spend any money on luxuries. “I’m very worried the bills are going up because I can’t live any more frugally than I already live,” she explained. “I already don’t turn the heating on most days and I never ever turn the heating on at night. “On the very coldest days I put it on at pm and put the kitchen timer on for half an hour. There is a cold patch around about pm. “I’ve got a bath but I don’t do that a lot to be honest. I’m very low maintenance. “I mostly eat vegetables. I’ve got a gas kettle because electric kettles take up so much energy. “I’m just worried it’s going to be horrible. I have to have faith. I’m not the only one with trouble going on, they have to come up with a solution.”  Diane says she has tried other ways to heat her flat by blocking all the air vents and putting a big thick heavy curtain up but said it just causes condensation and black mould. “But I refuse to moan about it because when I was young we didn’t have gas central heating, when it got cold you just put a jumper on or do some exercise,” she said. But then admits: “At night it is very cold in here. “At the moment it’s only one degree at night and I can feel my head and my nose are absolutely verging on damp. I have to go down the bed under the sheets to get warm. “My old neighbour, who died, had a ‘noddy’ hat which he kept on all through winter.

It spoke of the Queen and Prince Philipaposs fury after Andrew was pictured with topless women and touring red-light districts on a holiday in Phuket, Thailand. The Sunday People at the time revealed the Duke of Yorkaposs new friends were nicknamed the NyLon Gang because they went between New York and London with no expense spared.  Among the people in the gang was Ghislaine Maxwell, who it was said took Prince Andrew to nightclubs and parties.An insider told the Sunday People back in : Andrew has been told in no uncertain terms that he must cut loose from this gang with all their drug links before it drags the reputation of the Royals into the mire. His behaviour is not that expected of the Duke of York and he has been told it must end right now. Andrew is laying himself open to exploitation and scandal and is becoming an appalling liability. What sort of example does he set to the rest of the world  Reports have said Prince Andrew went on tours of red-light sex clubs with billionaire paedo Jeffrey Epstein and holidayed with pimp Ghislaine Maxwell while in Thailand. In a set of infamous photos, the Duke of York played up to his Playboy Prince moniker when he was seen surrounded by topless supermodels partying on a yacht off the coast of Thailand seaside resort, Phuket. Maxwell and Epstein were said to have been on the same holiday as Andrew, with the former thought to have stayed at his hotel. And the manager of a venue in Patongaposs red-light district said he was graced with a regal visit when the British prince visited the topless go-go bar. The wild holiday, which took place in New Year in , was around the time Prince Andrew became close with the couple - and just months before he allegedly sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre.  Andrew has vehemently denied this allegation and claims there was nothing improper about his relationship with the couple - who were both convicted of child sex crimes in the US. The Duke of York splashed out £,-a-night on a private villa at the lavish and ultra-exclusive Amanpuri Hotel in Phuket - where the couple also stayed, reports say. A Phuket-based journalist known as Lana told The Sun Online the resort is the go-to place for high-profile figures who need a high level of luxury and privacy.Spending his days on yachts with scantily-clad women, by night the Prince reportedly teamed up with Epstein to visit Patong - a notorious sex tourism hub where the streets are lined with go-go bars, massage parlours and other adult entertainment venues.  The pair visited the Banana Disco - a popular tourist nightclub which advertises itself online with videos of women wearing not much at all. The Queenaposs second son was said to have repeatedly visited a bar called Crazy Girls by Rock Hard, which is in a raunchy area where many of the girls are prostitutes.On Facebook, it says punters can enjoy the craziest and sexiest ass-smacking bar.Speaking to The Sunday Mirror at the time, the manager said: I was amazed to see the Prince here.

The farmhouse holds a special place in the Queen and her late husband Prince Philipaposs heart and her current stay is the first time sheaposs been there since Philipaposs death last April...Where is Wood Farm and what is its history Wood Farm is a five-bedroom cottage that is tucked away in a private part of the Queenaposs Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

In , it became the home of Prince John - son of George V and Queen Mary - who suffered from epilepsy and lived there with his nanny. After his death in  it was rented out.According to Vanity Fair, in the s Prince Philip took an interest in the cottage and began a renovation of it - decorating the walls in his artwork.He noted how it could accommodate the royals and their guests for short weekend trips, without the need to stay at the big house, which is expensive to run. Why does Wood Farm hold a special place in the Queen and Prince Philipaposs heart   The Queen and Prince Philip lived apart in the final years of his le, with the Duke of Edinburgh based at Wood Farm after he retired from public le while the Queen stayed at Buckingham Palace. However, she would regularly travel up to see him when she didnapost have engagements. The couple had only a small team of staff at the Farm, and they didnapost wear unorms as Philip didnapost like the formality.Former royal chef Darren McGrady once wrote on Twitter : I used to love it there. Itaposs so small you get to interact with them every day, rattle pans and play with the corgis! And when The Queen looks into the kitchen after a busy week and says aposThank youapos, you canapost get a bigger compliment than that. It is said the cosy nature of the cottage as well as its private location allowed the pair to be a normal couple. The Queen is believed to have sometimes cooked and done the washing up during her stays there. Meanwhile, Philip was said to enjoy his time there, tucked away from the other royals, reading, painting watercolours and having friends to stay. Other royals who have stayed at Wood Farm  However, it is not just the Queen and her late husband who have stayed at Wood Farm - many other royals have too as it is away from prying eyes.Before she married Prince William in , the Duchess of Cambridge would stay in the cottage while visiting the Sandringham estate. Similarly, Princess Diana is also said to have stayed there in the early s before her engagement to Prince Charles. Itaposs also where Sarah Ferguson was made to stay after her orce from Prince Andrew. She wasnapost allowed to attend the Christmas celebrations in the aposBig Houseapos at Sandringham, but wanted to be nearby to see daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The QueenPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRoyal FamilySandringham\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Alex Gibson, , had been on a night out with friends in Blackpool on Thursday, July  last year when the tragedy occurred. He had spent some time with his friend over the course of the evening but the pair separated when she went to Sapphires nightclub in the resort. In the early hours of Friday morning, Alexaposs friend called him from the North Pier and told him she didnapost want to live anymore. Alex raced to the seafront and went into the water to try and help her despite not being able to swim.An inquest at Blackpool Town Hall today heard that she got out and went for help but Alex was then found face down in the water less than an hour later, Lancs Live reported. Alex had met his friend while working at C Fresh Fish and Chips in Foxhall Road. Speaking at todayaposs inquest, she said: We were near the steps [to the right of the pier].  We were both in the water together. I was trying to help Alex because he couldnapost swim. We were hanging on to each other trying to keep each other afloat. I realised that the only way we were both getting out wassomeone got help so I told him that I was going to get out and get help. It took me a while to swim back because the current was really strong. After she managed to get out of the water she shouted back to Alex to tell him it would be okay. He was just trying to stay afloat, she said. I remember seeing him get further out. He was shouting for help. Mark Wright, who was sleeping rough in a shelter on the Promenade, said he was woken at .am when he heard Alexaposs friend screaming: Alex I canapost live without you. Giving evidence at the inquest, Mr Wright said he could see Alex struggling to keep his head above the water, but then lost sight of him because it was dark.  David Langton, who had also been asleep in a shelter, woke up when he heard Mark shouting to him: Get on your phone David thereaposs someone in the water. [Alexaposs friend] told me she wanted to kill herself, Mr Langton said in a statement. She told me her friend couldnapost swim. I tried to look for him but I couldnapost see anything. PC Ryan Kavanagh of Lancashire Police was driving down the Promenade at around .am on Friday, July  and pulled over when he saw Mr Wright at the side of the road. He asked meI was there because there was someone in the water, PC Kavanagh said.  I drove to the other side of the pier... below was [Alexaposs friend] near the wateraposs edge. She was covered in a blanket. She informed me she had been in the water, she didnapost want to be here anymore, and her friend had followed her to save her. She told me sheaposd kill herselfAlex was deceased. Leboat helmsman Sean Wright, who has volunteered with Blackpool RNLI for  years, was involved in the search for Alex. The crew spotted Alexaposs friendaposs white Primark handbag floating in the sea and  minutes later, at .am, found Alexaposs body face down in the water  metres from the shore. Alex was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where resuscitation efforts continued but he was pronounced dead at .am. The medical cause of death was given as drowning with alcohol intoxication listed as a contributory factor. Dillon Dixon had known Bradford-born Alex for  years after the pair met at school and the two friends shared a house together. They had been out together on the Thursday night and Dillon had gone home at around pm. The following morning at .am, not knowing that his friend had just been declared dead, Dillon woke up and jokingly text Alex saying hope youaposre alive. Weaposve all jokingly sent similar after a night out, Dillon said.  The inquest heard Dillon, who had offered to take Alex to swimming lessons, thought of him as being like a brother and the two friends went through everything together. He was a proud vegan and had a heart of gold, Dillon said. He enjoyed going to Stanley Park to feed the birds. Alex has in the past had many dark thoughts and said he was tired of everything. He was always sad inside but had the biggest smile on his face. The inquest heard that although Alex had self-harmed in the weeks before his death and occasionally had dark moments there was no evidence he had deliberately taken his own le. Concluding that Alexaposs death was a result of misadventure - the unintended consequences of a deliberate act - Senior Coroner Alan Wilson said: Disregarding his own welfare, as someone who could not swim, this young man bravely went in the water and tried to save a vulnerable young girl. Anyone who has seen the tide at Blackpool when itaposs fully in knows it is dangerous. Itaposs most likely he got into dficulty pretty quickly and he was witnessed by someone trying to stay above the waterline. He could not survive. Alexaposs dad, who attended the inquest, said that he had wanted to place a permanent memorial to his son close to where he drowned. He added that Alexaposs colleagues have raised the money to install a bench in Stanley Park. After Alexaposs death his boss at C Fresh posted online: Alex was truly an amazing young man. All his friends would agree that he was intelligent, hardworking, pleasant, caring and literally wouldn’t hurt a fly. He is a true hero drowned sacricing his le to help another. He was loved by all his work colleagues and we miss him terribly. Tragically taken at .

For breakfast every morning, he would eat sausages, eggs and bacon for breakfast, two Dominoaposs pizzas for lunch and a Chinese takeaway for his dinner - along with more snacks. Wearing XXXL clothes and with a waist that stretched to  inches, Tobie - who was an insurance broker at the time - was left ‘shocked and embarrassed to discover his weight was  stone.He began his journey to change his lestyle in September , binning the daily fast food, chocolate and ice cream diet to focus on boxing.After just over a year, he has lost more than  stone and has set his sights on turning professional as a boxer by the end of the year. He admitted it was a tough journey and that he would have ‘eaten himself to death’he had not made the changes and shaken his addictions to ‘calories, grease, fast food’. Tobie said: “Iaposve always had a real issue with food. It was a comfort thing for me growing up and it continued through my adult le.  When I was , I was playing rugby at a reasonable level but whenever I got an injury and couldnapost play, I was still eating asI was training. I just got bigger and bigger. Around  I decided to focus on my career but this meant I let my health get even worse. I ballooned from  stone up to  stone. I couldnapost put my own socks on. As his weight grew, Tobie decided to dropdown the levels so he didn’t have to train as hard and could focus on his insurance broker job. He began to pay even less attention to his health and his daily diet saw him consuming up to , calories a day while he continued his desk job. He said: “I was a food addict. It was the only drive or pleasure in my le outside of working so food was my getaway. I was at work one day and they brought the scales out for everyone to check their weight. I thought I was going to be  stone and that I was just a few weeks off the weight I had been previously. When I stepped on them, I was  stone and I was just so embarrassed about how big I had become. I was wearing XXXL clothes and had a  inch waist so I was massive.I started to get really ill - I was fatigued, couldnapost get out of bed, constantly had headaches. I was tested for diabetes and thyroid problems but it turned out to be the physical signs of depression. In order to kick his addition to unhealthy foods and to lose weight, Tobie set about going cold turkey on his favourite foods. I had to treat it like a drug addiction and go teetotal on most of the foods Iaposd eaten before, so no chocolate, takeaways or crisps. I felt awful at first, really ill. I was having withdrawal symptoms for the first few weeks, which was me coming off the copious amounts of processed foods and chocolate Iaposd been used to. I was addicted to calories, grease, fast food, the whole lot. My diet was abysmal so I had to change. If I hadnapost, I think Iaposd have eaten myself to death. Iaposd like to think Iaposve added  to  years on to my le by reversing the years of destructive eating.” He said he turned to boxing because rugby wasn’t inspiring him anymore and he knew he had to try a new challenge. He said: “Iaposve always been a boxing fan and I decided I needed to set myself a goal that kept me on track. I decided to train to become a pro. “I looked for help from a few people but I realised I had to do it myself. Once Iaposd lost a little bit of weight and gained confidence, I joined a boxing gym and started working by myself on the heavy bags. It has just snowballed from there. Iaposve had a couple of amateur fights since covid restrictions have been loosened and Iaposve been sparring regularly with experienced pros.Tobie set up an Instagram and TikTok page to keep him accountable. “Iaposve never been happier,” he said.The only thing that I feel which is slightly negative is that I didnapost do it earlier. I feel bad that I let it get to the worst and didnapost change my le sooner. Itaposs been a huge year of change. Itaposs helped my mental health massively too. I left my job as an insurance broker to start selling motorbikes as Iaposve always loved them. I need to get some more fights under my belt before I can go pro as well as sorting some sponsorship for travel. ”I was meant to be fighting at the end of January but that has been delayed as I have had covid.

Bonnieaposs mum, Rachel Morgans, , said her daughter broke the record as the youngest gestation to survive at Leighton Hospital in Crewe at  weeks and one day.Rachel said the cut off at Leighton Hospital is  weeks, so Bonnie could have been classed as a late miscarriage, but doctors gave Bonnie a chance after she showed a apossign of leapos. Thankfully, Bonnie came home for the first time on January , and her mum has spoken to CheshireLive about her experience. Rachel said: At the end of May , I found out I was pregnant because I thought I had appendicitis, but I never did.Bonnie was a twin, and I had miscarried the twin, so thataposs what the problem was. Bonnie was a suspected ectopic pregnancy, so basically they thought she might have been in the entrance of the fallopian tube.After a few scans, they decided that Bonnie could be a viable pregnancy, so we went ahead with it. Weaposve had quite a bad pregnancy. We had lots of bleeding and stuff like that, mainly due to the miscarriage and all that going on. Then on the th September at . Bonnie arrived in this world after like an hour labour. It was a very short labour. In Leighton Hospital, the cut off is  weeks, so Bonnie would have been classed as a late miscarriage, but the doctors that were on that day, and the midwe, who Bonnieaposs gets her middle name from, decided they would give Bonnie a chance,she showed a sign of le, they would give her a chance.  Bonnie came out and cried. Because she cried they said she showed a fight for le, so they did and pushed for her and sheaposs here today. Rachel said it was a aposreliefapos when she and her husband Adam Morgans heard Bonnie cry, but that their thoughts then turned to what was next for the baby. She said: I just assumed that she would never survive to be honest. Iaposve had a premature baby before at  weeks, my eldest, and I thought that was bad enough when she was born at  weeks. So I think me and my husband, when the labour started, we just assumed that she would never survive and that she would be born stillborn. But when she cried it was a relief, but it was also a bit like aposOK, so what does this mean type of feeling, weaposve got something  to deal with nowapos. Bonnie has such a horrendous time because she was transferred to Arrowe Park Hospital because they canapost look after a baby at Bonnieaposs gestation at Leighton, it needs to have what is called a tertiary care unit.  So she had to go to Arrowe Park. They have kept her alive to this day, but sheaposs had two cardiac arrests, sheaposs had surgery at Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital because sheaposs got whataposs called ROP [retinopathy of prematurity], which is basically from the oxygen that sheaposs needed to survive has damaged her blood vessels in her eyes. So sheaposs had to have laser eye surgery. You name it, this kidaposs had it. Sheaposs had the works. Bonnie came home on Thursday eveningfor the first time since her birth in September. Rachel said: Sheaposs on oxygen at home, but sheaposs on very minimal oxygen. Even though sheaposs like a Ib oz baby, sheaposs very tiny still. She looks like a newborn baby now. Sheaposs got whataposs called chronic lung disease now because she needed such high respiratory support. So sheaposs going to have that probably for the rest of her le, but theyaposre hoping they can get her off oxygen by her first birthday. Up until sheaposs around seven, she will be seen by a lot of neonatal consultants and paediatricians just to make sure that she does meet her milestones andthereaposs anything they can do, they will intervene to help us, but other than that they canapost see why she wouldnapost live a normal le at the minute. Bonnieaposs two older siblings, -year-old Imogen and two-year-old Ralph, were excited to welcome their baby sister home. Rachel added: It was quite a shock to them because we didnapost tell them we were bringing Bonnie home. We just pretended that we were having a meeting at the hospital and we just came home with her. I think everybody was just a bit in shock. Ralph has been so excited. He wants to help do everything. I think for Imogen, because of her age, sheaposs aware of whataposs been happening during our time at Arrowe Park and things, so for her itaposs just a relief that itaposs over and we can all be back together again now because since September we havenapost all been as a family unit.

No woman should feel coerced into breastfeedingshe doesn’t want to, but I’m in favour of making it as easy as possible for her to breastfeed her baby and for them to bond. One of the greatest deterrents for mums is nipple pain. More than seven out of  of first-time mothers report nipple and or breast pain in the first week after giving birth. And the most common cause is inadequate latching on, as described by medical ­practitioner Lisa H Amir and colleagues. Latching on refers to how the baby takes the breast into their mouth to suck, and unless a new mum is shown how to do this, it’s dficult for her to achieve a good latch.  Many new mums don’t understand that the whole nipple, including a lot of the areola, has to go in the baby’s mouth. If not, the baby ends up “chewing and chomping” on the nipple causing bruising and painful breaks in the skin. It’s excruciating when the baby suckles. No wonder a woman wants to stop. It’s worth notingthe pain is continuous it’s unlikely to be ­inadequate latching.  If nipple pain occurs only with breastfeeding, the diagnosis is more likely to be latching dficulty. Other conditions, however, can cause nipple pain during ­breastfeeding such as surgical scars or nipple piercings. Both very long nipples and “flat” or inverted nipples can be painful too. Conditions of the breast itself may contribute. Fullness and hardness of both breasts may indicate engorgement. Redness might signy a blocked duct mastitis . If swelling and redness is marked, and spreading across the breast chest, it’s cellulitis. With engorgement, both breasts are “full”, tender and tense. A blocked duct or mastitis can cause tenderness in a section of breast that may be swollen and hard. With mastitis, the breast might be inflamed, firm, and lumpy. It’s also possible to have allergic dermatitis caused by using a nipple cream.  There again there are conditions where breast pain, or the perception of breast pain, is unrelated to ­breastfeeding such as fibromyalgia and muscle pain. A baby’s so-called tongue-tie is sometimes quoted as a cause of nipple pain, but it rarely is because it rarely truly exists. This leads to many babies having unnecessary tongue-tie surgery. It’s easy to blame tongue-tie for inadequate latching but it’s rarely the cause and parents shouldn’t use it as an excuse for both nipple pain and poor feeding. Most “tongue-ties” ­disappear as the baby grows.

But when she grew up, Jasmine was dubbed aposflat packapos by school bullies who would cruelly joke about her unusual name.

What do you think about the name Ikea  Let us know in the comments...Jasmine, who changed her name in , said: I used to get called flat pack quite a lot at primary school. The bullying really shocked me because young children donapost know about Ikea. I legally changed my name when I was in secondary school. Itaposs only legally that I get called Jasmine.

Jasmine, an NHS admin assistant, said that her mum agreed to the name change - despite the family enjoying perks from Ikea after her birth.She said: When I was younger my mum got a letter from Ikea that basically said we could get furniture and toys free of charge.

Maps published at the start of the year show a sea of black as the highly infectious iant tore through the country.  But cases have dropped signicantly in all regions - although infections remain high in parts of Northern England and the Midlands. It comes as the Government announced Plan B measures are being lted and Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the country is moving into the next chapter in the battle with the virus.  The North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the West Midlands are currently experiencing the highest infection rates. London, which was the epicentre of the Omicron outbreak in the build-up to Christmas, has seen cases drop dramatically, and now only the South West has a lower infection rate. Cases in each region currently stand at:Yorkshire and The Humber - ,. cases per , people West Midlands - ,. cases per , people South West - . cases per , people South East - . cases per , people North West - . cases per , people North East - , cases per , people London - . cases per , people East of England - . cases per , people East Midlands - . cases per , peopleOn January , the Department of Health announced , infections in  hours, but in less than four weeks that has dropped dramatically. Yesterday afternoon the Government said there had been , new cases on Saturday. Last week the Government said it was moving into the next chapter in the battle against Covid.Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said he is optimistic the legal requirement for people in England to self-isolate with Covid can be lted in the coming weeks. Mr Javid said the Government was approaching a decision point and that it would be guided by the data in coming to a judgment.The current legislation is expiring in March unless Parliament decides to renew it. As a Government we have to make a decision on that, he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.We will make it in the next few weeks but it will be guided by the data at the time. From what we are seeing at the moment, from the case numbers, hospitalisations, the direction we are travelling at the moment, I am optimistic but I donapost want to say exactly what will happen in March. But I do want to see a time as soon as we can to remove all remaining rules and restrictions around Covid because we do have to learn to live with this virus in the same way we have learned to live, for example, with the flu. A World Health Organisation chief earlier warned that Europe is only passing the halfway mark of the pandemic - and said Covid should not be likened to flu. The WHO says governments should not suggest to people that the data has suddenly changed or the virus has suddenly got incredibly weak.Dr David Nabarro, the WHOaposs special envoy for Covid-, said that the end was in sight but said that Europe was only passing the halfway mark in a marathon.Asked about remarks that Covid- should be treated like the flu, Dr Nabarro told Sky News: I keep wondering what the people who make these amazing predictions know that I and my colleagues in the World Health Organisation donapost know. You see, what people are seeing from around the world and reporting to the WHO is this is still a very, very dangerous virus, especially for people who have not been vaccinated and whoaposve not been exposed to it before.

The claim came as US experts cast doubt on reports the Duke of York was looking to offer an early £ million settlement to Virginia Giuffre. Earlier this month, it was revealed Andrew, , had found a buyer for his beloved Swiss retreat, and the purchase was proceeding. Undoubtedly the sale would help fund Andrewaposs mounting legal costs in his civil lawsuit with Ms Giuffre, who has filed a civil sexual abuse case against him in New York. But now, an attorney for Jeffrey Epsteinaposs victims has revealed the deal appears less about paying her off, more about preventing her from claiming on the Dukeaposs assets.  If Virginia gets a judgment against Andrew,this went all the way through to trial and she received a financial judgment in her favour, she could execute on any properties he has, the most likely being his ski chalet, said lawyer Spencer Kuvin. If Andrew had properties in any companion country that would abide by such jurisdiction of the US, she can execute on those properties. Asked whether Ms Giuffre could make a claim on Andrewaposs -room Royal Lodge home in Windsor Park, which he shares with his ex-we, Sarah Ferguson, Mr Kuvin said it could not be ruled but would be very very dficult. A diplomatic conversation would be needed to be had, but I imagine it would be unthinkable that it would come to that, he said. Mr Kuvin warned: If the Queen has transferred any property to him, anywhere throughout the entire world, they could try and execute on that propertysuccessful in foreign courts.  Due to US courts having no jurisdiction over the UK,Ms Giuffre were to win her case, she would need to apply in Europe or Britain to have any damages enforced. Despite Switzerlandaposs famous financial secrecy, the assets and proceeds of an inidual are not protected there under law. Giuffre could execute on the chaletshe obtained a civil attachment order. According to Yves Klein, an asset recovery lawyer from Geneva-based law firm Monfrini Bitton Klein he states Swiss law ensures items and valuables belonging to an accused or to a third party may be frozenit is expected that the items or assets will be used as evidence, will be used as security for procedural costs, monetary penalties, fines or costs, will have to be ed to the persons suffering harm or will have to be forfeited. Mr Kuvin described speculation the Prince was preparing to offer a £million settlement to Ms Giuffre to dismiss her lawsuit as premature.  He added: Any offers or speculation about offers at this point is very premature. My guess is that they fight this as long as they can and only settle at the last minutethey feel they must. Giuffre, , has sued Andrew using New Yorkaposs Child Victims Actthat allowed those abused to sue their attackers. In , lawmakers introduced a look-back window that gave victims of decades-old abuse two years to file civil claims by August , , eventhe statute of limitations had expired. The deadline for claims was later extended due to Covid by then New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mum-of-three Ms Giuffre, who lives in western Australia filed the lawsuit on August ,  - just five days before the window closed.  She claims in , she was trafficked by billionaire Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with the Duke in London when she was , a minor in US law. Giuffre also alleges she was forced to have sex with the royal at Epsteinaposs home in New York and the US Virgin Islands. The Duke, , absolutely and categorically denies her allegations. She is suing Andrew for unspecied damages, which Mr Kuvin said could easily be in excess of £ millionshe is successful. Most of Andrewaposs wealth has been tied up in his multimillion-pound properties, including the ski chalet he bought eight years ago. Some £ million is accounted for by the Royal Lodge, once the home of the Queenaposs sister, Princess Margaret.  Although it is owned by the Crown Estate, the Duke splashed out a further £. million on its refurbishment when he and his family moved in, so he could expect afor his money. Previously, father-of-two Andrew was given Sunninghill House as a gt when he tied the knot with Fergie in . In , six years after the coupleaposs orce, he put the home up for sale but could not find a buyer for more than five years. The home was purchased in  by Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the former president of Kazakhstan, for £. million, several million over the asking price. The Duke is reportedly still earning money from the Queen after being banned from carrying out royal duties.  However, he has reportedly been stripped of the £, in public funds he received each year that saw the taxpayer hand him millions of pounds over decades. Andrew stepped down from royal duties following his car crash BBC Newsnight interview in November  about his friendship with Epstein. He is reportedly receiving an income from the Duchy of Lancaster - a private estate owned by the Queen consisting of , hectares of land in the UK. It includes assets in Cheshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Savoy Estate in London. The body earns Her Majesty around £ million a year. However, it is not known how much of this is paid to Andrew.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of York\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was certainly a day to remember, with a celebrity guest list, a stunning wedding dress and a decent amount of social media ban rule-breaking. The bride and groom couldnapost have looked more in love, beaming throughout the public part of the day - but a lip reader has revealed Eugenie wasnapost entirely happy about one thing her new groom did on the day.  When they were sitting side-by-side in St Georgeaposs Chapel listening to readings, Eugenie jokingly said to her new husband: Why arenapost you holding my hand  The Queenaposs granddaughter took the lead and coached Jack through the day, with a letime of royal experience meaning she knew exactly what the crowds wanted. The lipreader revealed that the royal bride initiated the coupleaposs tentative smooches outside the chapel, saying letaposs kiss in front of the cameras. Jack spoke openly about his nerves ahead of the wedding, telling the Daily Mail: Iaposll need to take a few minutes for myself before the speeches because Iaposm terried. Itaposs very exciting but Iaposm a little bit nervous. He overcame his nerves, however, to whisper beautul words to Princess Eugenie as she approached him at the altar. Experts revealed he said Oh, my heart when he saw his bride, before adding Oh break my heart.  And it wasnapost just Eugenie who made some interesting comments at the wedding, and the Queen left guests stunned with a hilarious joke. Pixie Geldof, who was lucky enough to get an invite, chatted about the celebrations during a podcast with fashion designer Henry Holland, What Were You Thinking  She said: I didn’t meet her but she was walking around saying stuff like, ‘Well, it’s great that I have a house big enough to hold all these guests’. She’s full LOL. She was being funny. She was like, ‘Welcome to my home’. Pixie also explained that she had a rather embarrassing moment during the day, which saw her trip over in front of a group of other guests. She said: I fell over at one point. Stacked it, but not on to the floor. And not drunk – hadn’t drunk.

Yesterday, pictures showed H er Majesty making the emotional pilgrimage from Windsor Castle to Sandringham for a stay at the five-bedroom cottage Wood Farm. The cottage is where the late Prince Philip lived following his retirement from public le and is where the Queen and her beloved husband could relax together. Her trip comes just weeks after the Queen stripped her son Prince Andrew of his military titles and learned grandson Prince Harry was launching a legal battle against her government over his security. And speaking to the Mirror, royal biographer Robert Jobson, author of the book Prince Philip’s Century, explained it has long been a place of retreat for the Queen. He said: The Grade II-listed Wood Farm, located on a secluded part of the Queen’s Sandringham Estate looking out to sea, has long been a bolthole for the Queen and her late husband Prince Philip. It is where the Queen, Philip, and their four children went to relax for more than  years. And, of course, it is where Philip made his retirement home in his twilight years with the Queen’s blessing The Queen was known to cook and even do dishes while she was staying there.

It is now the place Her Majesty, now a widow, has chosen to go for a bit of privacy and reflection after a traumatic  months. With its simple furnishings and open fires, it is a lot less formal than le at Windsor, Buckingham Palace and even Balmoral, although it is spacious enough. When Philip was there, he didn’t stand on ceremony and servants didn’t wear the usual royal unorms.  Prince John, the youngest son of George V and Queen Mary who suffered from severe epilepsy and possibly autism, resided at Wood Farm from  until his death there in  and before Philip moved in, the younger royals too had several times held private parties at Wood Farm.The Queen usually spends the month of January and February at Sandringham - following Christmas - in order to mark the anniversary of her father George VIaposs death.He died at the estate in February  - and this is when the Queen officially became the monarch.  This year marks  years since George VIaposs death and Robert says it will be especially poignant as it is also the first year the Queen will face the milestone since Philipaposs death last April. He added: As has been tradition for many years, The Queen has travelled to her Norfolk estate at Sandringham every Christmas and usually stayed on until after the anniversary of her father King George VI’s death, on  February in  in Sandringham. Again, due to Covid protocols, she had to remain at Windsor Castle since the autumn – where she held muted celebrations with close family, including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. This Ascension Day will officially mark  years as monarch following the untimely death of King at just . There will be no broadcast to the nation, for Her Majesty, who will be  in April, it will be a day in quiet, sombre reflection. Now without Prince Philip by her side, it will be even more poignant.

Laura Templar, , sent continuous emails and text messages to married father-of-two Patrick OaposConnor and his lover Caroline Decleves.She also swore at Mr OaposConnor as he headed to his office by Broadgate Tower in Bishopsgate in the City of London, Stratford Magistratesapos Court heard. Mr OaposConnor, a married man, became involved with Templar in March  when he was working as a construction worker at her luxury apartment block in Shoreditch. The affair was on and off for about a year before they split, with Templar later finding out that he had started another affair with Ms Decleves.  Margaret Bankole, prosecuting, said: Patrick OaposConnor is married and has two children. He worked in the same building where the defendant lives. The affair began in March  and lasted for two months. Then the affair was rekindled in March last year and ended the same month, which is when it is said the defendant began harassing him by constantly sending him messages, emails and text messages. She would also send text messages to his private phone number and his work phone number. He, on numerous occasions, told her she was harassing him and to stop messaging him. On one occasion she sent a text message when he dropped his we off at work stating that she knows he just dropped her off. At this point he was unaware how she would have known that. She purchased tickets to a work event he would be attending and he did not make her aware of that event. On  August at am, Patrick OaposConnor saw the defendant as he was walking into his office by Broadgate Tower.  They crossed paths. It is said the defendant shouted at him What are you still doing here  When are you going to f*** off. Youaposre a c***. Templar also shouted and swore at Mr OaposConnor in the street, on some occasions when he was briefing staff outside of work. Mr OaposConnor had an affair with his colleague Caroline Decleves who works as a concierge in the same building the defendant lives. The defendant began to harass her also, constantly sending emails, contacting her on ious numbers and shouting at her on the street. Templar, who works as an underwriter, told Mr OaposConnoraposs we about Miss Decleves and sent photos to him of his family and children. When Templar was interviewed by the police, she explained her behaviour as believing that she was owed answers, the court heard. Mrs Bankole explained: She said she was in shock as she really loved Patrick and she thought he wanted to be with her. She told the police that she asked him nicely to not stand outside where she lives however he continued to do so. She still sees them every day. When they see her they laugh and wave. Miss Decleves now no longer works in the building. Christopher Pickwick, defending, said: Miss Templar works from home quite often, she has had to see both parties on a regular daily basis knowing that they are seeing each other and that Mr OaposConnor had ended the relationship with her. She found it extremely dficult living in those circumstances. No doubtthey werenapost working so close to her she wouldnapost be in court today. Prior to Miss Templar being interviewed by the police the messaging stopped. Miss Templar in her words said aposI stopped of my own accord when I calmed downapos. Templar, of Bowl Court, Shoreditch, admitted two counts of harassment without violence between  July  and  August . She was given a  month conditional discharge along with a  month restraining order. Templar, who wept during the hearing, was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of £. District Judge John Law said: Obviously, it is a very sad day for you, at  years old to be in front of me having previous good character taken away from you by your guilty pleas. This was obviously an unfortunate and badly ended relationship. But you know that you took that too far in terms of what you did by continuing to contact and harass people who didnapost want to talk to you. Iaposm going to deal with this with a conditional discharge - one of the most lenient sentences I can give.

She took her first steps alone at the Paley European Institute in Warsaw on January , using a walker, and was able to walk to ring a bell on January  - the day they flew home. William said: Sheaposs doing great, sheaposs only been awake for about two hours a day. Sheaposs not walked for six years. Sheaposs not got any quadriceps in her legs, so she is wearing knee, ankle, foot and forceps supports to support her legs. She has to wear them every night and has her legs fully extended. Sheaposs taking between  to  steps at the moment. On February  they will fly back to Poland for intensive physiotherapy sessions for six weeks, putting in two hours a day. William, from Bathgate, West Lothian, added: If Arabella had this done two or three years ago she wouldnapost be going through so much pain. It had to be done before she was six. Her mum Catherine begged the doctors before she died but they said it was impossible. Arabella uses a crocodile walker for getting around and has an electric wheelchair. She is coming on leaps and bounds at school despite the setbacks she has experienced. Only % of her leg muscles work and she has had metal rods inserted into her bones which her dad described as like pencils. William said: We are working on building her confidence. Sheaposs scared of falling. The main thing is since having the op sheaposs been able to stand on her feet. Arabella is the first child in the world to walk without quadriceps muscles, she was also born with no biceps. She walks by using her glutes and abdominal muscles. The condition she has is very rare, weaposve not come across anyone  who has it in Scotland. Sheaposs doing brilliantly at school because the brain is the most important muscle in her body. She finishes all her work, everything she is given. Nobody knows how far she can push herself. The surgery was groundbreaking. She had mm taken out of her legs.When I was driving back to Warsaw in the rental car I was in bits. Sheaposs a strong wee character, Iaposm so proud of her. The op was such a success, seeing her standing and walking has been amazing. We are so grateful to the people who have helped us get here, sheaposs inspired children all around the world.

So few people suspected he was the one targeting his victims, raping them, killing them and dumping their bodies, often collecting several of their heads as sick trophies and performing sex acts on them after covering them in make-up.In one final sick insult to those he had murdered, he would oftento where he had abandoned the bodies and have sex with their corpses. Getthe newsyou want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In a further gruesome confession, Bundy even admitted to eating parts of his victimsapos bodies so he could possess them and they would become part of him. The killer claimed he was addicted to murder, saying: You feel their last bit of breath leaving their body. You’re looking into their eyes. A person in that situation is God. Bundy was finally arrested, tried and sentenced to death aged , having confessed to  murders. On January , , the killer refused to eat any of his final meal - a standard-issue steak, eggs, hash browns and toast because he hadnapost picked anything.  He called his mother, Louise Bundy, who wasnapost present at the execution. It’s a circus and we didn’t feel the agony we would go through by going down there would compensate for a few minutes talking to Ted through the glass, she said. And he also felt that way too. Askedhe had any final words, Bundyaposs response was surprising. Hesitating, his voice quavering, he told his attorney Jim Coleman and Methodist minister Fred Lawrence: Jim and Fred, Iaposd like you to give my love to my family and friends.  The LA Times reported: With that, it was time. A last thick strap was pulled across Bundyaposs mouth and chin. The metal skullcap was bolted in place, its heavy black veil falling in front of the condemned manaposs face. Barton gave the go-ahead. An anonymous executioner pushed the button. Two thousand volts surged through the wires. Bundyaposs body tensed and his hands tightened into a clinch. A tiny puff of smoke lted from his right leg. Meanwhile, hundreds of revellers sang, danced and set off fireworks outside the prison, chanting Burn, Bundy, burn and cheering when his body was brought out in a hearse. Eleanor Rose, the mother of one of his victims, Denise Naslund, said: For everything he did to the girls - the bludgeoning, the strangulation, humiliating their bodies, torturing them - I feel that the electric chair is too good for him.  Following his death, scientists were determined to find out what had turned this seemingly upstanding citizen into a monster. Bundyaposs brain was removed and a series of experiments were carried out to determine why he had carried out his horric crimes. Some brain injuries have been linked to criminality by some researchers, and several serial killers have shared similar neurological profiles. Bundy had told the detective who was instrumental in bringing him to justice that when he felt the urge to rape and kill, it was like a chemical tidal wave washing through his brain which he compared to being addicted to drugs. But when scientists examined Bundyaposs brain, it was found to be totally normal, with no legions, injuries or deformities. When he was alive, examinations by experts suggested he may have had a multiple personality disorder, been a sociopath, a narcissist and exhibited poor judgement and manipulative behaviour. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and an authority on violent behaviour, said a prison guard told her Bundy appeared to transform into a dferent person in front of his eyes. He said, aposHe became weird on me.apos He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odour emitting from him, she recalled. He said, aposAlmost a complete change of personality... that was the day I was afraid of him.apos Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@trinitymirror Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ted Bundy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Little Jamie Clarke was rushed to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital earlier this year after his mum, -year-old Ashley Hughes, discovered a lump on the side of his stomach. Doctors initially suspected the two-year-old was suffering from a viral infection because his glands were swollen but he was taken back to the hospital by his dad Jamie, , the following day. Nan Angela Daniels, , from Kensington, said Jamie’s dad noticed this lump again and “wasnapost happy” so he took him back to Alder Hey.They said it was constipation and again it could be his glands,” she told the Liverpool Echo. “Ashley brought Jamie to my house on Sunday and he didnapost look himself. He was very grey and white, he wasnapost sitting properly in his pram and he couldnapost really walk. Angela said Jamieaposs grandad Andrew was also concerned after seeing the lump, so took him back to Alder Hey. After undergoing blood tests, the family was told Jamie had anaemia and he was kept in hospital overnight. The results of further tests revealed the two-year-old had a tumour that was cm by cm in size, as well as polycystic cysts on his kidneys. They didnapost knowit was benign or cancerous at this point,” Angela said. Due to the amount of cysts on his kidneys, she said doctors were concerned that a biopsy could cause them to burst. So on January , he underwent an eight hour operation to remove the tumour and kidney. Doctors told Jamieaposs family the devastating news he had a Wilms tumour - a type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children. Angela said: It was horrible. We always thought the worst. We knew that it was something bad but we didnapost realise how bad it was. He doesnapost understand whataposs going on, I think thataposs the hardest part. Heaposs got a good support network around him he really has. I think Ashley is still in shock and still quite numb. The operation was successful in removing the tumour but Jamie must now undergo six months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Alder Hey and the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Wirral.Angela has set up aGofundme pagein the hope of raising enough money to take Jamie on a day out or on holiday once he has finished his treatment.She hopes sharing Jamieaposs story will help to raise awareness of cancer in children and encourage others to always go with your gut instinct and not be afraid to go back to the doctorsyou are concerned. In a message on the Gofundme page, Angela said: We thought we would try this to help us give our baby a day he deserves. He is our true super hero and I wish no one will ever have to go through what we all have been through.

Even a fibber as shameless as the charlatan in Number  cannot pretend he did not know a gathering with a cake and a rousing chorus of Happy Birthday by  revellers was a party instead of a work event.What more evidence is required by the police, Sue Gray, Conservative MPs, Parliament and the British people to conclude that Johnson broke the law, lied repeatedly when caught and is totally unfit to lead our nation  The Cabinet room bash in June  – held when families could not say goodbye to dying loved ones, funerals were tightly limited and singing widely banned – will be the final straw for many. Johnson has treated the public with utter contempt, every day he is allowed to remain in office adds insult to injury for those he took for fools.

The new witness reportedly insists Christian Brueckner was calm while she was with him and says they were stopped by police who reported no suspicious activity. The German witness, who was living in Portugal in , believes Brueckner was miles away from Praia da Luz in Portugal on the day Madeleine went missing from a resort there. A source told the Sun: She says she was not with him the day Madel­eine disappeared but spoke with him and again said he seemed normal. The source said: This ­testimony could be an issue.  This comes just days after German journalists who were investigating the case claimed they have uncovered “shocking” evidence which “heavily incriminates” Brueckner. British youngster Madeleine was just three-years-old when she vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment in Portugal in . German prosecutors claim to have evidence she is dead and named convicted paedophile Christian Brueckner as their only suspect. Despite going public with the information in June , they have still not charged him with any offence.  But now a team working for TV channel Sat. have handed the evidence to detectives probing Brueckner over the infamous case. Sat. investigators claim to have found fresh evidence linking Brueckner, who denies any involvement, to the crime. They will reveal more information about their investigation in a prime-time documentary, which is yet to have an air date. Announcing the show, Sat. said journalist Jutta Rabe and a team of reporters gathered new information about Brueckner. They claim it includes proof he was near Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished while her parents dined in a tapas restaurant. The channel said they collected “many new clues and indications” that corroborate the suspicions of German prosecutors.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Christian BMadeleine MccannMissing persons\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jowan Bobin and Minnie Gregory arenapost like most -year-olds, as instead of going to college or getting an apprenticeship, they decided to become farmers, as Cornwall Live reports.Last year they started managing Castle Brea Farm, near Penzance, Cornwall, even though neither of them had worked in that industry before - although Jowan had thankfully completed a course on the subject. The pair are mainly learning as they go but donapost regret a thing, as Jowan said: I can’t remember ever wanting to do anything .” What do you think to the young coupleaposs farm  Let us know in the comments... Neither Jowan or Minnie are from a farming background but for Jowan, looking after animals is something he has been doing since he was a child.He said: I was  when I took over my parentaposs patch of land and got my first animal. At first it was chickens. I used to sell eggs by the side of the road. Then I had one sheep. I have been building up my collection of animals since I guess. I have always wanted to look after animals.  Jowan, who did a farming course in Exeter prior to taking on the farm, started helping out in a local dairy as a -year-old and would go to the Royal Cornwall Show every year, talking to local farmers and breeders and looking at the animals. My mum is a dentist, Jowan added. And my dad is an extreme sport coach so nothing to do with farming at all. But they have been so supportive. Minnie’s only contact with farm animals came after meeting Jowan but to her own admission, she has no regrets. I was very much into my sports, she said. I am a crossfit trainer. I don’t come from any farming background either. My mum is a nursery teacher and my dad has his own ice-cream van business but I met Jowan and he’s the one who got me into this.  It can be hard at times. Especially on days when it rains all day. But it’s so rewarding too. The young couple raise rare breed goats, sheep, and guinea pigs, alonside a rare breed owl, finches and doves. They have a flock of Boreray Blackface or Hebridean Blackface, which is a breed of sheep originating on the St Kilda archipelago off the west coast of Scotland - the rarest breed of sheep in the UK with only about  breeding ewes known to exist.

Now we only have  rare breed Boreray sheep. Elvis is our golden Guernsey goat but we’re looking to get some more this year. We have some dairy goats and our two saddleback cross pietrain sows and our Oxford Sandy and Black pig. It’s probably the second rarest breed of pigs in the world. For us it’s not about having thousands of animals. It’s about focusing on fewer but rarer breed animals. Jowan is a member of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, a conservation charity whose purpose is to ensure the continued existence and viability of Britain’s native farm animals. He added: For us, it’s about conservation grazing and managing the land in a more sustainable and natural way.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

And the trick to doing it is so simple, but is something many parents donapost do as their children might not like it. In a message posted to the Cold Spring Harbor Fire DepartmentFacebook page an emergency responder revealed how shutting a childaposs bedroom door can make all the dference in the event of a house fire. The unnamed firefighter, who is a parent themselves, wrote: As a parent itaposs hard to convince little kids to sleep with the door closed, they always want it open just a little.  I do a lot of fire prevention at schools, so one thing I try and stress to kids is, how important it is to sleep with the doors closed. They go on to explain how there was recently a fire in a neighbouring area and share photos from the blaze - one showing a blackened, charred door, the other showing the back of the door which is still white. The homeowners and family dog are all doing well, they continue. The photos below are a great example of the importance of keeping bedroom doors closed while sleeping. The door pictured in both photos is a hollow core door to a bedroom. While the front of the door is severely damaged the closed door protected the bedroom and its contents. If this were an occupied bedroom the closed door could have saved a le. They added: The cause and origin of the fire are under investigation and believed to be accidental in nature. The post went viral at the time with over , shares more than , likes and hundreds of comments. Many were surprised to learn of the benefits of having a closed door.

Another urged the man to be nice as they wrote: That’s the type of joke you make when you’re dating and super comfortable around one another.

Whilst Mumsnet user JukEki was thrilled to be invited along to two weddings in June, she couldnapost help but disagree with how the message had been sugar-coated to seem like it is a night off from childcare for parents.Taking to the website, she created a thread which was titled, aposTo be irritated by this wedding invite apos and ranted to anonymous users online. She began: We have been invited to two child-free weddings, both in June. We are going to attend both and are pulling in favours for childcare.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.However I can’t pretend that I’m not mildly irritated by the wording in one of the invites! Detailing what both invites said, she continued: One invite said, aposUnfortunately bearing in mind we have limited guest numbers we cannot accommodate everyone’s children however this is a golden opportunity for parents to enjoy a night of relaxation and uninhibited revelry!apos The second simply said, aposWhilst we love your children please note this is an adult-only occasion. But it was the first invite that didnapost sit right with the mum, who went on to list of her reasons for frustration.  She added to her post: The first annoyed me as actually it’s not going to be relaxing for me in the slightest, it’s quite inconvenient and expensive to not be able to bring the children and I’m more likely to be hand expressing in the toilets than dancing on a table. It is absolutely the couple’s prerogative to have the wedding they want including making a decision to have no children - just own it and say so instead of dancing around it and pretending it’s a night off for me. She concluded: Happy to be told I’m unreasonable - first also contained a money poem which may be biasing me. Thankfully, other users agreed with her and agreed that there was no need for the bride and groom to dress up the invite as a favour. One person commented: I agree with you. I hate it when they try to pass it off as doing the guests a favour. Itaposs a nuisance and an expense sorting childcare. I think the second wording is much better. Iaposm all for child-free weddings, but as you say, just be frank about and donapost dress it up as a favour. Another shared: Not unreasonable at all, and yes the appropriate response is ‘irritated’.They are trying to put a positive spin on their decision, but it comes across as patronising. It’s also the babysitter that is allowing you to be child-free for a night, not the wedding. However, it sounds as though it is well-meant and they just haven’t had the opportunity to know what they are talking about.It’s also one of those things people say at this kind of event when they have young children “oh it’s great to have a night off”. It’s true, and it’s a polite thing to say, but it glosses over the effort involved. They have probably heard this before and taken it completely at face value.A third concluded: Agree with you. For us, we like to spend weekends with our children, have no local childcare and I would pass on the “golden opportunity” to pay £ for childcare to attend someone’s wedding. I am from a country where I have never heard of or been to a child-free wedding. Children are accepted as part of le and families.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Instead of taking her to a hospital or doctor, Jason consulted a QAnon Telegram group chat with tens of thousands of people who think Covid is a hoax. Vice reported the conversation that followed.Jason wrote in the group: “Do you guys think it’s safe to give ivermectin to an infant ”Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medicine used to treat infestations in humans including head lice.  Two years ago researchers claimed it could kill off the virus which causes Covid, but there is no clinical evidence to support this and it is widely accepted amongst medical professionals that it should not be taken. The group however, was not medical professionals and they had spent months sharing tips on how best to obtain the drug. One group member responded: “Baby aspirin to thin the blood a little and drop any fever and I would put some ivermectin on the bottoms of her feet,”  Other conspiracy theorists on the chat said he should wait to take advice from “experts” in ivermectin, in the group. One so-called ‘expert’ called Katie said: “From what I understand, yes it is safe to give to an infant, however please stop calling it Covid, it’s not Covid, it’s a simple cold. That’s how we got in this mess to begin with.” Jason took the advice and gave his baby a dose of ivermectin. “We gave her two doses of ivermectin at mg each. That’s what was recommended by someone on here. She got really sick after that. Related  I don’t know.” Jason said. Within minutes Jason said that his little girl’s condition was worsening. He said: “Baby threw up. Is that common side effect  She’s also turning a tad blue.” Someone  said this exact thing had happened to their child, and that they then took their child to hospital.Jason said: “We don’t trust hospitals. I told my son to give her more ivermectin.”Group members begged Jason to take his daughter to hospital. One member called Barbara said: “That baby needs to go to the ER. Do not hesitate. “I’ve seen too many go south due to O levels being low. The blue is hypoxia and that’s lack of oxygen at the tissue level. Please!”  Jason eventually told the group he had taken his child to hospital. “[My] son is taking baby to urgent care. Against my wishes but I’m praying for her. It’s in God’s hands now.” He later said she was “doing better”. He added: “God knew what to do even though I thought hospital was certain death.

Doing so has the potential to spread the risk of Covid- infection throughout the community. “Secondly, the doses of ivermectin that are being advocated for use in unreliable social media posts and other sources for Covid- are signicantly higher than those approved and found safe for scabies or parasite treatment. “These higher doses can be associated with serious adverse effects, including severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, neurological effects such as dizziness, seizures and coma. “Finally, there has been a --fold increased dispensing of ivermectin prescriptions in recent months, leading to national and local shortages for those who need the medicine for scabies and parasite infections. “It is believed that this is due to recent prescribing and dispensing for unapproved uses, such as Covid-.

The threat of a Russian invasion has put Nato forces on standby and led the Foreign Office to begin withdrawing some staff and dependents from the embassy in Kyiv - where some British expats said they have bags packed ready to go west.Ben Garratt and his we, Alice, live in Queenaposs Park in London but moved to the Ukrainian capital at the end of the December to meet their baby and oversee official paperwork. Ukraine has very dferent surrogacy laws to the UK which means that itaposs much easier to work with an IVF clinic and a surrogacy agency here to have a baby that way... so Ukraine is an international hub of people coming for surrogacy services, Mr Garratt, , said. Weaposve always known that it would be a load of paperwork once he was born, for us to bring him home - but obviously, what was going to be a period of potential boredom, waiting in an apartment in Kyiv for two or three months, is now more nerve-racking. Unless we can get a passport for Raphael in the conventional way, orthat becomes impossible, the British Embassy get to the point they can give Raphael an emergency passport, we canapost leave - so it is nerve-racking.  Thanks to the process of getting a passport for new-born Raphael, the couple were always planning to be in Kyiv until mid-March. Despite international concerns of impending conflict between Ukraine and Russia, Mr Garratt, who works in stakeholder engagement at London North Eastern Railway, said Kyiv feels completely normal. Itaposs really strange...like Oxford Street on a Saturday... except for the snow, he said. It looks normal. Looking out the window... itaposs buzzing... thereaposs no evidence of panic buying, thereaposs no queues anywhere.  Iaposve never been in a country thataposs been invaded, I donapost know what that feels like, but it feels bizarre that it could happen . He and his we continue to keep in contact with friends and family who are nervous on their behalf. Weaposre nervous on their behalf, weaposre nervous because theyaposre nervous... thereaposs a lot of nervousness spreading through the family, he said. I guess there is a point at which we think, well, aposletaposs just go and seewe can cross a border and get to the UKapos... I donapost think weaposre anywhere near that and Iaposd be really surprised, Iaposd hope the British government wouldnapost let it get to that stage.  Jez Myers, a business consultant who has split his time between Manchester and Kyiv since , said while he is planning toto the city in mid-February, the major concern for many is the possibility of a cyber-attack. If a cyber attack happens, yougot to be concerned about heating, electricity, and cash, the -year-old said. Finding somewhere you can escape to, so: bag packed, clothing, water, chargers, grab your bag and get west...the mantra that most people are adopting. But news of embassy staff leaving is not a concern for Mr Myers.  Itaposs taking precautionary measures... my plan is toin middle of February as scheduled, he said. An IT director from Glasgow said has no intention of leaving his we and son in Ukraine as he maintains all is well. If the tanks roll and they are on the streets, that will bepain...I have no intention of leaving the flat we bought here, George, who has lived in Ukraine for more than two years and did not wish to have his second name included, told PA.are just being cautious... we live normally in Kyiv for now.

The troop of more than  primates were seen climbing over the vehicles, which were parked opposite the historical San Phra Kan shrine in Lopburi province in Thailand on January .Incredible footage shows the Simians dragging, biting, and ripping the rubber trim off of a pickup truck in an attempt to access the vehicle. Then another group of monkeys were seen trying to break into a black sedan that was parked next to it. Staff say that holidaymakers who leave their cars unattended are at risk of having the vehicles damaged.  These primates are known to swarm the vehicles - which may be rental cars - within minutes.Tourists are advised to park their cars further away. They are also meant to contact the local staffthe animals are stopping them from driving away.Panot Bunsi, one of the drivers whose car was damaged, claims there are now warnings about the wild animals.  The annoyed tourist said: I knew the monkeys pester people for food but I didnapost know they also attack cars. If someone told me before ofthere were warning signs, I would not have left my car. In March , the monkeys had an astonishing mass brawl over scraps of food. In February , dozens of monkeys took over a schoolaposs swimming pool and rummaged through the bins in search of food. Residents believe the monkeys brings good luck to the city.  Many of the monkeys congregate around an ancient Buddhist temple, but they have also taken over a cinema - forcing the previous owner to move out and close the business. Government officials have tried to control the monkey population without success.In , large numbers of monkeys were sterilised after their numbers spiralled out of control during the coronavirus lockdown, with well-meaning locals feeding them sugary drinks.Environmental officer Narongporn Daudduem said the department has a long-term plan to build a sanctuary in another part of the city, but plans are likely to be met with resistance from some of the residents who donapost want the monkeys living near them.

Mykul Myas said decided to order in some Mexican food so he could enjoy his cravings in the comfort of his own home. The -year-old from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, said he waited  minutes for his £. burrito bowl, but after going to eat his meal, he was shocked at what he found. Mykul claims his dinner had been completely polished off by the driver, who also left a nasty note stating that he had eaten his food because he did not receive a tip. The carpenter said: “I had a craving for Mexican food and I didn’t really want to go out and get it. “I decided to get it delivered. I ordered a burrito bowl and waited about  minutes.  “I then got a notication saying it was at my door, so I went to check and the bag had just been left there. “I didn’t actually see the person. I was planning to give him a tip in cash, but he drove away before I’d even had a chance. “I couldn’t believe it when I opened the box up to eat my food, and it was all gone. I was in total disbelief, and then to see that note there, it felt really personal. I honestly thought it was someone pulling my leg. I was disappointed, as I was really looking forward to the meal. I ended up just having some ramen noodles after that.” The anonymous note was left in the eaten bowl and read: “Leave a tip next time and this might not happen. “And don’t bother tryna [sic] get me fired. Going back to Amazon.” Shocked Mykul said he could not believe what had happened, adding that he had put some cash aside to give the driver a tip, but they had driven away before he got a chance.Mykul says he has also received an influx of cruel hate comments from strangers around the world after posting the photograph to Facebook, where it has since gone viral.He said: “I’m guessing the driver was just angry about me not leaving a tip in the app, so they decided to eat my food and leave that note. “After reading people’s comments, they were telling me that most delivery drivers make their money off tips. But I had no idea. “I was getting a lot of hate comments about not leaving a tip through the app. ButI had seen the person, I would have given them a cash tip, that was my plan. “People were telling me I got what I deserved and that I’m disgusting.

Declan Haughney, , insists that he was not trying to rob his deceased relative Peadar Doyle, , after he and another man dragged him for five minutes from his home to collect his pension from a Post Office in Hoseys, Ireland last Friday morning.Declan, , told the Irish Mirror he’s now “the talk of the town” and has been branded a “murderer” in the local community ever since the sensational story emerged. But he insisted he’s “not an eejit” – and believes he’s being accused of dragging his dead uncle into a post office to rob his pension – because he previously stole from his aunt. He said: “Why would I want to rob my uncle  I’m  years of age yeah, I’m not a child, I’m not a young fella. I’m not an eejit to walk into Hoseys with a dead man and collect his money. Am I cuckoo  Am I cuckoo  I’m not.”  Declan, who admits he used to have a drug problem, and who served two years in prison, says he’s now being accused of knowingly bringing his dead uncle in to get his pension – because of his past. He told us: “That’s why they’re saying it, that’s why this is all coming up now – because I done it before. A bank card came through the aunt’s door and I got the pin code and went down for fraud and that’s why this is all coming up. “People know about that in the town you know. But that was  years ago. I’m off the gear three years and I’m doing well.”  And Declan, who has a black eye and facial injuries after allegedly being attacked following the incident last Friday, revealed that he now believes his uncle was dead before he even reached the post office. Declan says he believes Peadar may have been dead by the time he and another male got him under the bridge at Pollerton Road, which is less than a two-minute walk from his home – but the pair continued to bring him to the post office by linking arms with him and dragging him there.  When the pair propped Mr Doyle up against the counter a member of staff contacted the Irish gardai.Both men, one of whom is said to have known Mr Doyle ‘very well’, have since made full statements to the police investigating the incident from Friday.  Officers believe he may have died around three hours before his impromptu trip to Hosey’s newsagents and post office in Carlow with the men, despite the claims that he was alive.

But over the years she has learned to love her grey hair and says she only needs to wash it once a month, making her le as a farmer easier. Anna, who lives in Hungary, says she sometimes only combs her knee- hair once a week when she’s busy working and explains how low maintenance it is.She says she feels honoured when she hears others being inspired not to dye their greys after seeing her hair. Anna proudly shares snaps of her stunning silver locks with her , followers on Instagram– although she has received some strange requests from men. Anna – who has over one million views on her haircare video – says: “It may partly be genetics, but I only wash my hair once a month because that’s how it behaves best. “And I don’t apply anything to my hair except some oil after I wash it to tame it and keep it manageable. “It’s honestly easier having long hair on the farm because you don’t have to style it and you can put it up in a bun. “Sometimes when I’m doing a lot of physical work on the farm, I can go for a week without brushing it and it’s fine. “‘I used to get picked on or stared at for my grey hair as a teenager but now I only get compliments. “I feel honoured when women write to me saying that they’ve found the courage to go grey because of me. It fills my heart with happiness. “There’s definitely a stigma with a young woman having grey hair and I would love to help change that. “However I will admit that I do get some strange requests from men online. A male follower offered to pay to lick my grey hair! I was lost for words.” Anna says that she was distraught when she started getting grey hair. She recalls: “I begged my mother to let me dye my hair when I began going grey. I was so sad and worried that I would look old. “I felt extremely self-conscious all the time. People would stare at my strands of grey hair and I would get remarks about it.  “I remember this incident when a boy called me ‘Cruella’ and it did hurt my feelings. “But over time, I learned to love my grey hair and it became an extension of myself.” Anna says she was inspired to grow her locks after reading folklore and she hasn’t had a proper haircut since she was  years old.  Anna, who works as a regenerative farmer with her boyfriend, explains: “I joined a folk-dance group as a teenager and became inspired by folklore imagery and women of history with beautul floor- hair. I wanted to emulate their hair and started growing it. “The last time I had a proper haircut was when I was fourteen years old. I went to the hairdresser and asked for a trim but the hairdresser chopped off far too much. “Since then I have never been back to the hairdresser. If I ever need to, I just ask my mother to give me a trim but that’s only once in a few years.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeenagersHairstyles\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Colleen Le, , said she offered to give her then boyfriend one of her kidneys because he was struggling to live with chronic kidney disease as a teenager. At just  years old, the unnamed man had to have dialysis treatment and told her his kidney was ing at less than five per cent. Colleen, from the US, says she made the decision to donate after a test showed the young couple were a match and they both made a full recovery following the successful procedure.But just ten months later, she claims he called things off after being unfaithful to her and accused her of going ahead with the transplant to look good. Colleen has gone viral on TikTok where she talks about her brutal allegations under the name @colleeeniie and has gained more than two million likes.  In one video, she said: I decided to get tested to seewe were a match because I didnapost want to watch him die. I was so nervous. In a later clip, Colleen explained that the coupleaposs relationship changed with her boyfriend claiming he was going to a bachelor party in Vegas with his church group seven months after the operation. The student said she was not concerned about the weekend getaway because he was a devoted Christian and that she decided to focus on studying for her exams. But she says she was shocked when he arrived home and admitted to cheating on her during the trip. A lot of arguments later, I eventually forgave him and gave him a second chance, Colleen said. But another three months later, he ended the relationship and saidwe are meant for each other, God will bring us back together in the end. In a further blow, Colleen claims he blocked her on all social media s and she now shares her heartbreak on TikTok. Many of her followers commended the student for saving her ex boyfriendaposs le and said he did not deserve her. Others criticised her for still telling her story years after the devastating events unravelled. One person commented: You have the biggest heart and he didn’t see it. His loss. Another person said: You deserve so much better, Iaposm so sorry this happened.Colleenaposs story echoes that of TikToker Uziel Martínez who claims he was dumped by his girlfriend weeks after donating his kidney to her mum.The teacher, from Baja Calornia, Mexico, told how his heroic move was not enough to save his relationship and that his ex has since married another man. Since his ordeal, he has also made several TikToks about the nightmare breakup as part of a recent trend.

The conclusion we’ve come it is that we are not going to get to the bottom of this till we talk to the people themselves, the kids who are getting involved in this and that’s where we are putting our effort at the moment.“We have secured the assistance of the local high school who are going to work with us on this, maybe through focus groups and with a little bit of talk perhaps we can find a solution.”Sergeant David Rourke said: “I don’t have all the answers and I’ll not pretend that I do. I wish I did, but I certainly believe what we need to do is engage the children and youths of the communities a lot better.“So what we’ve been trying to do is work in partnership with the high schools, the community council in Peebles and ious other organisations such as Youth Action Teams to address and ert the youth’s attentions from vandalisms such as what has happened in the play park to more productive activities around the region.“Generally when we have vandalism or any sort of crime we have feedback such as ‘where were the police’ or ‘what are the police doing to resolve this ’“The police cannot resolve this on their own. Resourcing levels as we know across the board in the UK as a whole means we cant have police officers on every street corner every minute of the day to prevent crime happening so what we need to do is work as communities to spot it happening in the first place.”.removeA number of groups in the area have also stepped up to help.Lori Lee from the Community Sports Hub said: “We’ve been working hard to try and get sport back up on the table and that’s something during COVID we have been unable to do. So the opportunity hasn’t been there for young people to get out and be active in sport and potentially this is a reason behind anti-social behaviour.”And Dave Hodson from Tweeddale Youth Action added: “Through our youth clubs in Peebles and Innerleithen we continue to offer activities and opportunities for young people to have fun. We offer a place where young people can access support, advice and where we can signpost further services.“And really through volunteering opportunities we try and foster a sense of community spirit within our young people.“It’s important to say as well that the vast majority of our young people do play an active role in community le and are fantastic.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-woman-placed-supervision-series-offences","story":"A -YEAR-OLD woman has been placed on supervision for the next  months as part of a Community Pay Back Order at Jedburgh Sherf Court.Lee Greens, of McLaren Court, Hawick, pleaded guilty to a series of offences.The offences included police assault, obstructing police, threatening or abusive behaviour and breaches of bail."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-shares-story-christmas-antarctica","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has joined a small percentage of people who have visited both the North and South Poles through her work on a Navy vessel.Only . per cent of people have visited Antarctica, and Kasey Easson, , is now part of that group.Kasey has been a member of the British Navy for almost seven years and this year spent Christmas aboard HMS Protector, a survey ship.“Over the actual Christmas period we were down in Antarctica,” said Kasey. “It was amazing.“We stopped off at little islands where we were allowed to get off and go for a little walk around, so I walked around an island called Horseshoe Island.”Over a six month period Kasey had journeyed from the North Pole to the South in her role as a supply chain logistician on HMS Protector.She said: “In the past six months I’ve been to the North Pole and the South Pole.“We went up north first, seeing polar bears and ice.“We had to test the hull to make sure it was stable enough for us to go down to Antarctica.“We also took scientists onboard with us who tested the ice to check the solidity of it for global warming and [to] record data.“Then we sailed from the North Pole all the way down to the south in six months.”Kasey told the Borderthat being one of a handful of people to have visited Antarctica and the North Pole was something she never expected to do.She said: “I never ever thought I would make it to both [poles].“They say it’s . per cent of the world’s population has been to Antarctica.”Protector is a survey vessel used to assist the British Antarctic Survey as well as other UK and foreign research stations in Antarctica and the southern hemisphere.During her time on the ship last year, Kasey and her colleagues delivered coronavirus vaccines as well as completing their other surveying duties.“We’re a survey vessel, so we survey the seabeds and create new maps, handing data to the British Antarctic Survey – we work very close with them..remove“We went to south Georgia and the Sandwich Islands where we supplied them with coronavirus vaccinations.”Now back in the UK, Kasey, who lives in Plymouth, has visited her family in the Borders to celebrate a belated Christmas with her loved ones.“I phoned by dad on Christmas Day but I was only allowed a half-hour booking so everybody could call their home,” Kasey explained.“Onboard as a crew we had a Christmas dinner, and then afterwards we had our ship’s raffle which we fund ourselves.“And then there are these red tins we get which are ship deployment tins which are sent to all ships on deployment over the Christmas period alongside bases – it’s like a charity tin that has little gts.”"},{"url":null,"title":"treatment-works-preparing-key-construction-delivery","story":"A SCOTTISH Water project in Peebles is “well under way”, according to developers.Work began on the site, which is south of the existing works on Bonnington Road, in February .And now construction workers are preparing for the delivery of Transportable Treatment Units which are being constructed off-site.A Scottish Water spokesperson said: “We are continuing to make good progress on the site.“The next major phase of the project involves the delivery of the Transportable Treatment Units which are being constructed off site.“This is arriving in  pieces over the course of two months on lorries.

seen since at least the mid-s and, at least in the case of women, very likely to be the highest rate ever in the UK, according to the research, funded by the Centre for Ageing Better.But effects of

female and male employment rates at age  rose more gently, by four and five percentage points respectively.This almost certainly reflects the greater need for income at older ages among those living in poorer areas, the IFS said.Jonathan Cribb, an associate director at IFS and an author of the report, said: “The sharp increases in employment have come in particular from those in poorer areas, and for those who have lower levels of education, suggesting that without a state pension they cannot afford to retire.”In general, more than nine in  -year-olds do not change whether they are in paid

We were observed to have less than one per cent discards and, of that, only a point of a percentage was cod.#There#s really nothing scientic behind this, it#s all political.#The CFA was due to meet

Seeing Morris in context is what is so fascinating.”Morris was a pioneer, encouraged by like-minded artists and friends such as Edward Burne-Jones in his passion for the hand-made, championing the collaboration between the designer and the craftsperson, something which still guides the modern approach to craft, not least at Dovecot. His designs have withstood the aesthetic changes of some  years of fashion, including a particularly garish colour reboot during the s.In Morris’ day, each finely-coloured wallpaper was hand block printed, briefly and unsuccessfully by Morris himself, determined to learn the craft but admitting himself wanting, but subsequently by printers Jeffrey  Co. “They feel like handcrafted prints,” says Grenyer. “There’s an incredible quality that you don’t see in modern wallpaper. It’s like being in a print exhibition!”Morris had reacted against a Victorian aesthetic background of naturalistic yet flamboyantly ornate florals, frequently embossed, and wildly garish. There were designers who embraced the machine age, such as Christopher Dresser, with his brilliantly successful mass-produced yet fine domestic objects, and Pugin, whose austere Gothic-inspired wallpaper for Westminster Palace was the stern-faced opposite of his more outlandishly elaborate peers.And Morris too, markedly freer and more organic in his designs than Pugin or Dresser, decorated palaces, or at least one. He designed a wallpaper for Balmoral which still hangs today, “I’m not sure where...a corridor I think!” says Grenyer. The design was, unusually, flocked – hugely popular with the Victorian middle classes – replete with royal symbols and entirely dferent to the rest of Morris’ output. “It was made as a one-off, only for Balmoral, and was not a wallpaper that you could buy,” she tells me. “They can still remake itthey need to do any repairs, because Morris still have the block in the archives.”All the stages of Morris’ career are covered here, from his first design – Daisy – with Morris, Marsh, Faulkner  Co, the company he founded in  aged  with the somewhat A-List Pre-Raphelite painterly set of Ford Maddox Brown, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones, alongside the architect Philip Webband the engineer artist Peter Paul Faulkner, amongst others. In , after what may have been creative and may have been personal squabbles, although never with Burne-Jones, he took on the sole control of the company as Morris  Co. And it was wallpapers that had been the most successful part of that first company, a legacy he took in to Morris  Co. His first successful early design, Trellis, is still produced today, although his designs clearly evolved over the considerable period of his output, something which Dovecot is charting out on the walls. “Noone  in the firm designed wallpaper, or was interested in it, or thought it mattered to people,” says Grenyer, of Morris’ beginnings. Wallpaper was one area of handmade craft that could be relatively inexpensive, “because you could produce an intricate pattern with three blocks of colour not seven or eight.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, despite the march of technology, to which Morris was so healthily opposed, the ethos to which the company was founded still holds true – whilst the wallpaper is digitally printed, Grenyer says that you can still order hand block printed Morris wallpapers from the original blocks, “ you’ve got deep enough pockets!” For the rest of us, wandering round the exhibition, it’s all a lightly flocked flight of the imagination.The Art of Wallpaper – Morris  Co, Dovecot Studios,  Infirmary Street, Edinburgh,   , www.dovecotstudios  Jan –  Jun, Mon – Sat, am – pm, Adults £., Under  Free other concessions available.

This clearly calls into question the purpose and legitimacy of an ad hoc body whose participants, other than Sir Geoff, are operating under the cloak of anonymity.I was recently invited to send in a response to a long, rambling box-ticking public consultation survey from this secretive commissariat. It had all the hallmarks of one of those questionnaires which seek to pre-determine the desired response. Whatever authority this body has been granted by Edinburgh City Council or Edinburgh University, it should certainly not be entrusted with the power of le or death over the city’s monuments and memorials.This is not to say the suitability of such things should not be reviewed from time to time. About  yards north of Dundas’s column, there is a bronze plaque to Marie Stopes, a proponent of eugenics who favoured contraception as a means of controlling the birth rate of the lower orders, and sent love poems to a man she particularly admired, Adolf Hitler. I imagine few,any, would objectthis was removed and scrapped, but presumably, since her defects do not fall under the heading of Slavery or Colonialism, it will be staying in place.Questions inevitably arise as to whether, say, the removal of the statue of Dundas, a listed artefact, on the recommendation of this anonymous body would be lawful. Last year the suggestion that a plaque be fixed to his column to place his effigy in historic context seemed like a reasonable compromise however those entrusted with the wording decided to distort history by omitting all reference to the fact that it was Dundas, as a young Lord Advocate, who successfully – and passionately – defended the former slave, Joseph Knight, and then went on to steer William Wilberforce’s abolition bill through the House of Commons.Bearing in mind that Martin Luther King, in The Purpose of Education, wrote that we should resist allowing our minds \"to become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda\" it can reasonably be concluded that the plaque is a travesty.It seems obvious that such manipulation of history, together with the recent savage attacks on members of our academic community, require the attentions of a Scottish Government inquiry led by qualied lawyers and historians who actually know what they are talking about.David J Black, Edinburgh.IN DEFENCE OF DUNDASI WRITE in support of the excellent articles by Iain Macwhirterand Stuart Waiton , both exposing the disturbing side to the current campaigns by the city of Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh to publicly demonstrate the correctness of their racial credentials. The council’s Slavery and Colonialism Review Group is casting its net far and wide in an endeavour to identy anything and anybody associated with Edinburgh who can be linked in some way with slavery or to the British Empire. Even David Livingstone and the Royal Botanic Garden have been included as possible culprits by the Review. Furthermore, the treatment of David Hume on the part of the university has been shameful – as have been the actions of those who attack critics like Professor Sir Tom Devine by labelling them as \"racist\". I just wish the Review zealots would make sure that they get their historical facts right before they rush to criticism.There can be no doubt that Henry Dundas was a scoundrel. He was heavy drinker, a womaniser and a man who shamelessly used his considerable powers of patronage to help his friends, particularly fellow Scots. However, to continue to place all of the blame on Dundas for the delay in the abolition of the slave trade is I think unfair and ignores the reality of the tumultuous years of the early s. Those attacking Henry Dundas have to address the question as to how a slave-supporting Parliament at that time was ever going to vote for abolition. Britain was then at war with Revolutionary France and was faced with the real prospect of invasion. Furthermore, the British establishment was terried that the success of the French Revolution might inspire similar uprisings in the UK. The country was in turmoil and it fell to Dundas to try to restore order at home and to meet the French threat.Realistically in the s there was very little chance for legislation to abolish slavery to succeed in Parliament. A previous attempt to pass a motion for abolition had been very heavily defeated. Dundas knew perfectly well that Parliament was packed with members who had strong vested interests in the slave trade. It would take years for the force of the moral argument against the vile trade to have any chance of success. During the debate in  he proposed a gradual path to abolition stating that \"my opinion has been always against the slave trade\". Indeed it was Dundas who had taken on the case of the West Indian slave Joseph Knight in  which successfully established that there was no slavery in Scotland. Dundas concluded his remarks in the Court of Session by stating: \"Human nature, my Lords, spurns at the thought of slavery among any part of our species.”‬‬‬‬‬ So it is quite wrong to state that Dundas was fighting a rearguard action against abolition and that he alone was responsible for condemning some , Africans to the horrors of slavery.‬Eric Melvin, Edinburgh.* IAIN Macwhirter and Stuart Waiton are correct about the increasing adolescent attitudes in our universities, local authorities and society generally, particularly when luminaries such as Sir Tom Devine and Professor Johnathan Hearn are insulted as racists. It is akin to traducing JK Rowling for her common-sense response to the fatuous moves by officialdom to abandon a word used since time immemorial to describe a female person.Mr Macwhirter might also have mentioned that Viscount Dundas, by postponing the slave trade’s abolition by  years until , possibly ensured that the trade did not continue thereafter, for  years or much longer. The new explanatory plaque installed on the Dundas monument should include this point too. It is sad that an otherwise-eminent professor like Sir Geoff Palmer should tarnish his reputation by such insults and thus undermine the objectivity of his review into Edinburgh’s involvement in slavery.Last March he ascribed a “racist element” to the medics’ reaction when his we gave birth to their first-born in . As he was not present, and the staff did not know he was Jamaican, they were understandably concerned that the baby’s colouring might indicate something medically wrong .He then linked this out of context with David Hume’s brief nuanced footnote about non-whites’ “inferiority”, said “this is the statement that killed George Floyd”and led “to the incident that Meghan and Harry talk about” .John Birkett, St Andrews.SHAMEFUL TREATMENT OF FEMALE OAPsMANY womens entitlement to a state pension has been systematically exploited by Westminster governments over the years. First we have the scandal of the Waspigroup, women born in the early s who were not afforded the Government’s own rules of notice of an increase to their state pension age. Now we hear that women awarded a small state pension on their own right were ultimately eligible to claim  per cent of the basic state pension, based on their husbands contributions, something the women affected were not made aware of. This anomaly was highlighted as far back as during the Coalition Governments time in officeby the then Work and Pensions Secretary Steve Webb, yet only now do we hear any call for justice.This is a scandal of monumental proportions because it affects well in excess of , women, many of whom have existed in poverty, with deteriorating health, unable to correctly look after themselves due to a lack of income. Many hundreds of hours of debate on the plight of the Waspi women have been heard in the House of Commons there has been cross-party agreement for justice, yet the Westminster Governments exploitation of women and state pensions continues. Becoming a pensioner should be a good experience, an experience of \"well done\" after an average of  years of work, so it is quite galling to learn that the Government has been exploiting your entitlement to a state pension.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"flinty-mcstags-excruciating-edinburgh-return-loan-deal-loopholes-monday-kick-off","story":"Its pretty clear which clubs this kind of loophole-closing is aimed at. Clue: it isnt ones in the Scottish Professional Football League. Only those living in a cave could have failed to notice the cottage-industry going on at Chain recent seasons, whereby clubs owned by some of the richest men on the planet have stockpiled a weapons-grade amount of talented youngsters and then flogged them for loan fees – and subsequently large transfer fees – to balance the Financial Fair Play books over the years. At one point last season, the London outfit had  players parked at ious clubs around Europe. That follows a long-running trend by the Stamford Bridge club. They employed this strategy most notably at Vitesse Arnhem, where they would simply park any number of up-and-coming iniduals to either groom for their own first teamor with a view to fattening their geese for selling at the market.Celtics Islam Feruz learned the hard way the downside of entering the Cha loan system – a kind of brand repackaging factory that allows the Londoners to slap a Harrods-style sticker on to its goods – and is now no longer in the game in part because of poor handling by his advisers but also as a result of poor loan choicesby his club and weve already seen the travails experienced by a similarly ill-conceived move for Billy Gilmour to Norwich City.The rule changes are welcome but the new regulations dont really go far enough. For a start, they will not affect players under the age of  or those who have been club-trained and thus it will not limit their respective clubs ability to loan them out – the exact category that Gilmour and Feruz is was in.Off with his headEdinburgh announced the  of mascot Flinty McStag in an excruciating social media post last week in which current first-team stars speculated on the peak physical condition the oversized plush toy had got himself into.

Oranje legend Johann Neeskens did not disappoint: there was an air of mystery about him, and his tobacco-tinged accent seemed to give him a gravitas not just because of the lucidity of his arguments but because he was well-versed enough to be making them about Scottish football and its importance on the world stage. At no point did I stammer or stutter in his company, however. Laura Muir was a dferent matter altogether, though. As part of said sports editor duties I was present the night she was awarded Scottish athlete of the year for  and was introduced to her as a sponsor. But boy could I think of anything to say to her. Starstruck  Possibly. I shall watch with intrigue as she goes in search of the m world indoor record in Birmingham next month – not least because it is the same venue where she broke the European indoor record, simultaneously setting the second fastest time ever over the distance in .Bolognas secret sauceIf youve been paying attention over recent seasons youll know that Bologna have become one of the most astute clubs in European football for talent identication. There is a clear pattern of second- and third-tier outfits across the continent who have come to the conclusion that in order to remain relatively competitive in a financial and playing capacity then buying promising youngsters cheaply and selling them for exponentially higher fees is a sound business model. It is one Bologna have embraced with gusto. In their efforts to look under every stone they have already bought Aaron Hickey to the club. Meanwhile, Luis Binks, a very highly-rated Scotland eligible centre-back who was Thierry Henrys first signing for FC Toronto, also arrived in Emilia-Romagna in . Hickey found himself playing at right back in Fridays - defeat by Bologna – left-backs playing out of position was a feature of a previous Monday kick-off – which is perhaps the reason why the Serie A outfit are now weighing up a bid for Aberdeens Calvin Ramsay for the opposite flank to Hickey.January is a notoriously dficult month to do business. It is a cliché that has become so ubiquitous when discussing the winter transfer window that it is almost possible to believe it is actually true. Its easy to see why that might might prevail but it doesn not stand up to scrutiny. Last year only £m was spent by Premier League clubs in the month but it was clearly an outlay that was affected by the ongoing financial restrictions placed on clubs because of the pandemic. A year earlier clubs in Englands top flight chucked £m at solving their respective problems. In Scotland, while most players switched clubs for free or on loan deals, there were still  transfers registered in and out of the country during January and early February – more than a quarter of which took place on deadline day. A sign of theto a semblance of financial prosperity – or perhaps desperation– comes with the revelation that for this month alone  transfers – just three less than all of last years equivalent window – have already been signed off by the Scottish Football Association.The number of shots Scott Jamieson dropped in his first five holes at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship as a cheque for million slithered from the one-shot overnight leaders grasp in the first hour or so of play in the UAE."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13188134.jpg?type=article-full","title":"turn-new-leaf-brighter-prospects-climate-change","story":"SO here we are in January  the start of another new year, and an important one for climate change and bioersity.Many of us will have started this new year with thoughts and ideas of what we might like to do dferently. I have spoken to dozens of friends and contacts who all found  to be a challenging and tough year. Much of it was anxiety inducing, stressful, emotionally dficult and draining. I don’t think I’ve ever worked so incessantly hard. As a result, the whole of  just felt relentlessly negative.   But with , we are faced with a brand-new year, and I would like to think there is a real sense of hope and optimism. In fact, I am determined to make sure  is better. Can  perhaps become a year of relentless positivity  And what would that take Of course, many of the issues of  have not gone away, and therefore still need to be tackled.  Butwe can lt our ambition and take the time to explore and understand the climate solutions that need to take place, and start implementing them, then I do believe the next  months can become relentlessly positive. To be fair this has already begun.We launched the online climate change course, the Climate Solutions Accelerator, around Christmas . We already have over , people signed up, with additional interest from all over the world.Although Covid is still a live issue, and causing much disruption and distress, climate change still remains more of a worry, long term.And for most of this year, the UK Government retains the chair of the international climate negotiations.   Glasgow’s COP didn’t deliver everything many of us may have wished. But it did raise the profile of Scotland’s leadership on climate change in international circles.As a result of COP, many of our leading businesses committed to net zero targets, well ahead of Government targets, making pledges to become net zero by ,  or .However, it is apparent that many organisations are ill equipped to reach these net zero targets and, in many cases, do not necessarily entirely understand what would be required to do so.For those of us inclined to make New Years resolutions, then this year, more than any other, I hope people will commit to learn about climate change.  If we all take the time to properly understand the solutions that all of us have a role in helping to deliver, I believe our businesses and organisations will be stronger for it.Only by addressing climate change and tackling it at scale can we have the confidence in our own societies and economies.The Climate Solutions courses, the Climate Solutions Accelerator and the Climate Solutions Professional, which we have written with experts at the University of Edinburgh, University of Stirling and the Institute of Directors, helps to make that learning as simple as possible.For those who have already undertaken the training there have been some remarkable reactions and a real sense of purpose and responsibility.The more people who take this training, especially at a management level, the more robust our businesses and institutions will be. With Scotland leading the way, the more we can help our friends and allies internationally to follow suit.We are all on a journey to reduce our carbon emissions.  And there is still a great deal to do.Butwe can take the time during  for everyone to learn about the science and solutions of climate change, we will be incredibly well placed to make a dference domestically, and in a very strong position to share and sell that expertise to every country that is further behind on their journey – and that is almost all of them.If Glasgow’s COP taught us anything, it is that every government in the world is having to take this issue seriously. Our own government, while still having much to do is well ahead of most other major economies. Taking a continued lead on climate change is not just ethically and morally the right thing to do, it is fast becoming the most economically sensible route too. And the only one that assures us of a safe future.Let’s make  the year we took climate change action seriously. Take a Climate Solutions course and get up to speed quickly with what we need to know and do. Help play your part in making  a year of relentless positivity!Go online now at  climatesolutionsnetwork or for more information on the courses contact Alex at info@Jump-digital  "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Ranieri, meanwhile, has won  and lost  of  Premier League games since Leicester’s title win. vw,vw,px, px\"Claudio Ranieri’s sacking is the th Watford managerial change under the ownership of Gino Pozzo and family Starting with Gianfranco Zola shortly after their takeover, Pozzo and family – along with chairman Scott Duxbury – have made  permanent managerial appointments in less than  years.That included three in  days in one madcap spell shortly after Pozzo took sole charge in .That was admittedly influenced by Oscar Garcia standing down due to ill health after just four games in charge, though the decision to appoint Billy McKinlay on a permanent basis and sack him two games – and four points – later was Pozzo’s alone. vw,vw,px, px\"Gino Pozzoand Scott Duxburyhave never hesitated to pull the trigger No manager in their time in charge has matched Zola’s  games, with only he and Javi Gracia breaking through the half-century mark in a single spell – Quique Sanchez Flores was appointed twice, serving first for  games and then .Win percentages are an imperfect measure of success in that time due to the dference between Premier League and Championship football. Slavisa Jokanovic and Xisco Munoz, as well as McKinlay, cracked  per cent but Gracia’s . per cent is the best record for a reign spent wholly in the top flight.Beppe Sannino, Walter Mazzarri, Marco Silva, Nigel Pearson and Vladimir Ivic are the other managers to work under Pozzo, as well as two-time caretaker Hayden Mullins. vw,vw,px, px\"The first manager axed by the Pozzos has a pub named in honour of his success in his subsequent job One of the Pozzo family’s first acts after taking charge was to sack Sean Dyche in July  in favour of Zola.While they have cycled through managers at a dramatic rate since then, Dyche was appointed by Burnley less than four months later and remains in his post.He has twice taken the Clarets up to the Premier League, in his second and fourth seasons in charge with a relegation in between, and has established them in the top flight until this season’s fight against the drop. So highly regarded is he in Burnley that a pub in the town – The Royal Dyche – is named in his honour.Dyche is the longest-serving current Premier League manager, while in the EFL only Harrogate’s Simon Weaver – who spent  seasons with them in non-league before ’s promotion – and Wycombe’s Gareth Ainsworth have been in post longer.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642778651871.jpg--covid_19___fri_21st_january_figures.jpg?1642778651000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220121newscovid 19 fri 21st january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Ms Armstrong’s bill proposes the setting of minimum targets for the number of children being educated in integrated schools, as well as providing dedicated funding for facilitation of the sector.It aims to reform and meet the growing demand for integrated education, giving it the same support as controlled and maintained schools, allowing for its promotion and provision.It’s a complicated and complex issue, but an issue both the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsand the Controlled Schools’ Support Councilhave made their positions starkly clear on.For the Alliance MLA, her bill is all about making education better to make society better, but it has left the Assembly and education fractured once again. She has stood up to the expected criticism and worked with amendment after amendment.For some a sht towards integrated education is a huge stride towards constructing a more harmonious future for Northern Ireland. It has big name supporters. Irish President Michael D Higgins is among them. Movie star Liam Neeson has backed schools seeking to secure integrated status, and boxer Carl Frampton is an enthusiastic supporter too.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up But for s of education for the last century, the Catholic Maintained sector and the Controlled sector, there is a corner to be fought for — and both have come out fighting over the last week.Already the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolshas hit back at UUP leader Doug Beattie, saying his use of the phrase “educational apartheid” to describe the current system of education was “ill advised” and “inflammatory”.“The bill makes recommendations for substantial change prioritising support for one sector at a time when an independent review of education is underway which will make recommendations for change in the system as a whole,” the CCMS responded.It added: “The bill’s definition of integration devalues the efforts of Catholic schools who work diligently within communities to encourage dialogue, peace and understanding.”Speaking on behalf of the NI Commission for Catholic Education, Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown has branded it “a very radical and very narrow piece of legislation”. He said the feeling is that Catholic schools are being portrayed as ‘the baddies’ and told to “shut up” in the debate.They are starting to speak now.“Catholic schools contribute positively to the education system through the pursuit of excellence whilst remaining faithful to their distinctive ethos, vision, and approach. The purpose of integrated education proposed in the bill could apply to all Catholic Schools and indeed to schools across all sectors,” said the CCMS.“Regrettably, in its current form the bill prioritises integrated schools above every other school.”And, for once, there is agreement from the other major school sector. The Controlled Schools’ Support Councilisn’t lying down either.“Controlled schools are open to all children and young people,” the CCSC said, pressing the fact that integration is already an integral part of the education system as it is.“The bill uses language that we would contend already applies to all controlled schools and in fact should apply to all grant-aided schools,” it continued.“Controlled schools have been labelled by many as single identity, serving only one side of our community.This is wrong.“The controlled sector is the largest of the education sectors.It accounts for % of all schools and includes  controlled integrated schools and is committed to educating children and young people from all community backgrounds together.”One key issue, and one which has been shared by politicians, is that they believe the bill, as it currently stands, prioritises integrated schools above all others.Ms Armstrong, the bill’s sponsor, is trying to work with all sides of the debate, but every ounce of acceptance is hard won ground.“I have been made out to be the big, bad demon who’s trying to destroy all dferent types of sectors. That is so far from the truth,” she said.“The Education Minister seems to think that I have an issue with the Independent Review of Education.But there is no guarantee that the review will be taken forward after the election.”Having waited so long for support to be offered by Stormont for integrated education, the time for try and grab it and make good the promises of the Good Friday Agreement, was now.Education Minister Michelle McIlveen maintains she supports the education of children together.“What I do not support is poor legislation,” she said.“What I do not support is legislating for one sector at the expense of others, whether intentionally or unintentionally.What I absolutely do not support is playing party politics with the law that will govern our education system.”The amendments to the bill were flying thick and fast throughout last week, every side of the multi-faceted debate trying to shape and mould to their own wishes.What could come out in the end will be a mishmash of ideas, a watered down version of what the supporters of integrated education want.The Education Minister said that there are very serious concerns in terms of how the bill currently before Stormont was drafted.“As introduced, the clauses lack legal clarity. These definitions,not amended, will be open to misinterpretation and therefore result in legal challenge,” said Ms McIlveen.Her DUP colleague Diane Dodds added: “This would create a hierarchy within education where the controlled and maintained sectors would be at the bottom of the pile.”Others appear, on the surface, more flexible to change.Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan saidenacted, the bill “will further enhance the efforts to break down barriers to build a new society rooted in peace and in equality”.There, then, is some qualied support.Daniel McCrossan of the SDLP said his party does not feel the Integrated Education Bill hinders parental choice.“Integrating our children together in education will have massively positive effects for the future of this place,” he said.Ulster Unionist Robbie Butler said his party would like to see a single education system implemented in Northern Ireland and will “work positively with this bill and the amendments to see a bill which is fair and just”.Clare Bailey of the Green Party said: “It’s still shocking in  that we have to declare statements such as ‘of course we want to educate our children together’. It’s , let’s just do it.”People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said he “doesn’t know why religious organisations should have still have such a grip on schools today”.Anyone see the problem Unlike the progress made last week with a bill to introduce a flexible school starting age, the consent across the board is simply not there.Though many say they want change they circle the edge of the future still afraid to take that leap of faith. Integrated education is no easy circle to square, and the edges are sharp.Related topicsDepartment of EducationMichelle McIlveenKellie ArmstrongLiam NeesonPat SheehanSinn FéinSDLPDaniel McCrossanRobbie ButlerGerry CarrollMore On Department of EducationCrisis in our FE colleges ‘fuelling NI’s skills deficit’ PremiumCovid: it isn’t going away you knowNI’s further education colleges see sharp fall in student numbers PremiumStronger messaging urged as NI schools bear the brunt of Covid relaxations PremiumMark BainOpinionLessons to be learned from rare agreement on school starting ageMost ReadFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldEdwin Poots says we is ‘disgusted’ over ‘joke’ as UUP leader Doug Beattie apologises in AssemblyBelfast man Jon O’Hara one of two Ravenhill Road crash victims - mancharged with causing death by dangerous drivingLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughRavenhill Road crash: Motorist accused of causing deaths of two men had drunk #up to six beers#, court toldTop VideosPlayVideo: Surfer rescues two people after kayak overturns in PortrushPlayVideo - Three police cars damaged as hijacked car collides with church wall in BelfastPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy Latest EducationCrisis in our FE colleges ‘fuelling NI’s skills deficit’NI’s further education colleges see sharp fall in student numbersStronger messaging urged as NI schools bear the brunt of Covid relaxationsMark BainOpinionLessons to be learned from rare agreement on school starting ageSchool Covid absences not as bad as feared, says Education MinisterLatestRussia warned of ‘unprecedented sanctions’ over Ukraine as world leaders talkBrit Awards host Mo Gilligan: I want it to feel like a partySix people dead after crush at Africa Cup of Nations match – reportsLinfield board want to buy new players, but manager David Healy is resisting the calls for him to spend Blues cashLeading Scots cardiologist named head of British Society for Heart Failure,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However Mr Kingston, its group leader on the council, said they would support flying the flag on July  to mark the Somme anniversary, or a day to mark the NHS – a suggestion put forward by Alliance.Andrew’s birthday is part of a list of designated days when the government advises the Union flag to be flown at council buildings.Although the decision is still to be ratied by the full council, Mr Beattie said a decision not to raise the flag would be the right one.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBrexit...UUP leader Doug Beattie during a press conference at Stormont.

Nobody is saying that you’re guilty. Innocent until proven guilty remains fundamental, but it shouldn’t fly.”Mr Kingston said much of the DUP’s concern had been over the lack of information received by his party ahead of last Friday’s meeting.“The DUP’s position remains that we want the Union flag to fly every day in Belfast as it does for the majority of councils across the UK,” he said.“Sinn Fein and the SDLP are only using this issue to remove another flag day. Our concern is that next year this day will be dropped all together. We do need clarity on the details. Will this be a one-off  Will there be support for that on a permanent basis ”Mr Kingston said that assurances were still needed on an alternative date.“We would support July  to mark the Battle of the Somme, or a day to mark the NHS,” he said.“That is our position. Regrettably, for all the talk of working together, the SDLP did not have the courtesy to communicate with us in advance of the committee meeting last Friday to seek an agreed way forward.“We share concerns about the seriousness of the allegations of misconduct by Prince Andrew.”SDLP councillor Donal Lyons welcomed what he described as a “DUP u-turn” and said he was glad common sense had prevailed on the issue.“The DUP’s belated change of stance in this is welcome, as is the support for this move from the UUP,” he said.Despite claims by the DUP that they were blindsided by my proposal, we were open and transparent from the start, I made this proposal in advance of last week’s council meeting, including my offer to work with unionist councillors to find an alternative day to fly the flag.”On the Alliance Party proposal, councillor Nuala McAllister said there was little time for council to raty any decision had it not been brought forward in the committee meeting.“Had this been brought forward at council we would have had to wait until March for it to be ratied and that would have been too late,” she said.“We have followed proper process, but this is a non-argument. We’re all on the same page. It is council’s responsibility to reflect the feeling in society,” she added.“There are serious questions around his judgment.”She added: “The Alliance Party has said that the flag should fly on an alternative date We are not trying to stoke any fires.”Related topicsDoug BeattieBelfast City CouncilMore On Doug Beattie PremiumEdwin Poots doesn’t rule out official complaint over Doug Beattie’s joke PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionChange is in the air... and it could have lasting ramications as poll shows Sinn Fein could take First Minister’s position PremiumMark BainOpinionIntegrated education remains Rubik’s cube conundrum for NIEdwin Poots says we is ‘disgusted’ over ‘joke’ as UUP leader Doug Beattie apologises in AssemblyEdwin Poots’ we ‘genuinely upset’ over joke posted by UUP leader Doug BeattieMost ReadFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldEdwin Poots says we is ‘disgusted’ over ‘joke’ as UUP leader Doug Beattie apologises in AssemblyBelfast man Jon O’Hara one of two Ravenhill Road crash victims - mancharged with causing death by dangerous drivingLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughRavenhill Road crash: Motorist accused of causing deaths of two men had drunk #up to six beers#, court toldTop VideosPlayVideo: Surfer rescues two people after kayak overturns in PortrushPlayVideo - Three police cars damaged as hijacked car collides with church wall in BelfastPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy Latest PoliticsEdwin Poots doesn’t rule out official complaint over Doug Beattie’s joke#Ashamed and embarrassed#: UUP leader Doug Beattie apologises for historic tweetsEdwin Poots’ we ‘genuinely upset’ over joke posted by UUP leader Doug BeattieAllison MorrisOpinionSobering poll figures on safety show how much work needs to be done to change behaviourEdwin Poots says we is ‘disgusted’ over ‘joke’ as UUP leader Doug Beattie apologises in AssemblyLatestRaymond Blanc defends Delia Smith’s use of frozen peas in cookingRussia warned of ‘unprecedented sanctions’ over Ukraine as world leaders talkBrit Awards host Mo Gilligan: I want it to feel like a partySix people dead after crush at Africa Cup of Nations match – reportsLinfield board want to buy new players, but manager David Healy is resisting the calls for him to spend Blues cash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that

extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they

Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week. They are also to seek a meeting with planners to outline their case.SAINTFIELD ndash Damage to Saintfieldrsquos century-old floral farm cart at the weekend has infuriated village residents and especially the members of the pioneering Bloom committee.The celebrated cart, laden with polyanthus, pansies and spring flowers, had its shafts broken at the body when it was lted from its perch and ped to the ground before midnight on Saturday.In December it was removed to the side of the Orange Hall and behind locked gates to make space for the Christmas tree.

The competitiveness of the derby resulted in a stalemate by half-time.With chances coming early on into the third quarter, short corners naturally started to follow. lsquoHinch were able to work the ball up through Adam Dodds before passing over to Jason Campbell, who was able to win a short corner for his side.Matthew Martin released his drag flick going just wide of the post.Saintfield were able to keep lsquoHinch at bay until a cross ball from Martin found team-mate Andrew McIlwaine at the back post to opening the scoring.With lsquoHinch looking to keep their lead, they engaged a high press on to the Saintfield defence as they hoped to increase their lead.However, with this high press tactic Saintfield were able to break away past the lsquoHinch defence only to be met at the top of the circle by lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell, who did well to prevent a goal.A super ball from Leslie Harrison to forward Lewis Higginson, allowed the lsquoHinch attacker to run the baseline and win a short corner.Martin took a drag flick only to be stopped by the Saintfield lsquokeeper.Saintfield responded by pushing lsquoHinch into their own circle and winning a short corner.The Saints managed to convert off the short corner to equalise the game in the final quarter.Despite a few more half chances, both sides went home with a share of the spoils..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Magnificent Kilcoo are champs of Ulster again  ","story":"KILCOO are one game away from a place in this yearrsquos All-Ireland Club Championship final.Last Sunday, the Magpies produced a spectacular performance to dismantle Fermanagh champions Derrygonnelly at the Athletic Grounds in a one-sided affair to win by  points.Mickey Moranrsquos men are now red-hot favourites to win the All-Ireland club final after losing out to Galway champions Corofin after extra-time in .But Kilcoo must first overcome St Finbarrrsquos in the semi-final clash at pm on Saturday, January  at OrsquoMoore Park, Portlaoise and will be taking nothing for granted.Last Sunday, goals from Daryl Branagan, Ceilum Doherty and Shealan Johnston contributed to the onslaught in Armagh to secure the Ulster title by a comfortable margin.Paul Devlin enjoyed his afternoon splitting the sticks, with reassurance within the squad stemming all theway from the back through Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, who bossed hisarea and even registered a point of his own.With the pain of the  All-Ireland defeat still hurting, Kilcoo will be looking to right that wrong and taste success.ldquoThe Corofin game really hurt, said Kilcoo star Ryan McEvoy.ldquoAfter playing so well for so long and then just not getting over the line, it hurt.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history. He also met a number of residents at the community centre before visiting Rowallane Garden for a guided tour.Mr Moffett concluded the first day of his visit with a visit to the Belfast Road community centre to view the new facility and was impressed at the potential of fitting out the remaining empty buildings which would include a heritage area to complement the planned windmill park.Mr Moffett, who also played a round of golf at Royal County Down and visited the Mournes, said the beauty of Co Down, with its unique visitor sites and the central location of Saintfield, reinforced in his mind the importance of the windmill park project and the heritage centre.The third and final day of his visit was spent at a local shop exploring the location of his familyrsquos th century farm in Leggygowan.Mr Moffett said: ldquoExploring my family history was a wonderful way to end my visit to Saintfield.

It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast year because we were in deep lockdown it never happened and because of the current Covid rules it had to be postponed again, which is probably why only three walkers came out to meet him at the Knap car terrace in perfect walking weather, on a bright and crisp morning to join in a -mile replacement walk.On the hillside just above them are the neat foundations of a Roman Building which contained  rooms all grouped around a courtyard with the building being dated to the late rd century AD by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. It seems a natural harbour was to be found to the east of this area and one theory is that this was a guesthouse connected with naval activity at the harbour as no evidence of a water supply or baths common in villa’s could be found. In the early ’s the trust carried out excavations on site and pieces of Roman pottery and tiles were found and a public viewing  now overlooks the site.They soon warmed up due to a short but stf climb onto the clftop and followed a narrow path through woodland to descend the Golden Stairs into Porthkerry Country Park, where the frost covered board walk led them towards the ft Porthkerry Viaduct. Deviating off the cycle path at Robin’s Walk brought them into muddy fields beside the Whitelands Brook for the climb up to join the A opposite Welford and along the verge to cross a stile leading into fields behind Blackton Farm.A well-worn farm track led to the road for the journey to Penmark Village where they entered the churchyard of St Mary’s for their mid-morning refreshments, utilising the steps on the preaching cross as seating whilst enjoying the warm sunshine. The church dates to the th century being mentioned for the first time in  and a few centuries later the tower was added, but most of its medieval traits were lost when it was renovated during the Victorian era..removeThey continued and joined part of the long distance Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail, through fields on the boundary of Cardf Airport making towards Fonmon with its lovely duck pond and stunning weeping willow tree which cascades over the water. Then climbing steps into a small wood leading to muddy fields near Home Farm they eventually exited onto Port Road following it southwards to East Aberthaw.Taking time out they paused at the Blue Anchor for a swt pint outside in the fresh air before following Well Road downhill. This road was previously known as Marshe Way, one would presume because the River Thaw flowed to reach the sea by this route until the Aberthaw Power Station was built and the river was re-routed.Tramping muddy paths below the main Vale railway line through the nature reserve which is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, they headed through the reed beds beside the western end of the delightful lake, overseen by the ruined Aberthaw Limeworks built in , to arrive at the sea defence wall. Heading out onto the beach they found a suitable place for lunch sitting on a washed up tree trunk beside the dunes and overlooking the Bristol Channel and English coastline before continuing along the salt flats.The beautul refurbished clf steps on part of the Wales Coast Path brought them steeply uphill into Fontygary Leisure Park, which was eerily quiet due to the winter months and reaching Fontygary beach, they continued up steps following the coast path past the old disused limestone quarries to reach the southernmost tip of mainland Wales and Rhoose Point. Onward through Porthkerry Holiday Park and the Iron Age hillfort at the Bulwarks, to slither downhill through the woods back into Porthkerry for the steep climb back up the Golden Stairs in order to make their way along the clftop to Cold Knap, just as the sun was sinking in the western sky.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Ranieri, meanwhile, has won  and lost  of  Premier League games since Leicester’s title win.Constant change vw,vw,px, px\"Claudio Ranieri’s sacking is the th Watford managerial change under the ownership of Gino Pozzo and family Starting with Gianfranco Zola shortly after their takeover, Pozzo and family – along with chairman Scott Duxbury – have made  permanent managerial appointments in less than  years.That included three in  days in one madcap spell shortly after Pozzo took sole charge in .That was admittedly influenced by Oscar Garcia standing down due to ill health after just four games in charge, though the decision to appoint Billy McKinlay on a permanent basis and sack him two games – and four points – later was Pozzo’s alone..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Gino Pozzoand Scott Duxburyhave never hesitated to pull the trigger No manager in their time in charge has matched Zola’s  games, with only he and Javi Gracia breaking through the half-century mark in a single spell – Quique Sanchez Flores was appointed twice, serving first for  games and then .Win percentages are an imperfect measure of success in that time due to the dference between Premier League and Championship football. Slavisa Jokanovic and Xisco Munoz, as well as McKinlay, cracked  per cent but Gracia’s . per cent is the best record for a reign spent wholly in the top flight.Beppe Sannino, Walter Mazzarri, Marco Silva, Nigel Pearson and Vladimir Ivic are the other managers to work under Pozzo, as well as two-time caretaker Hayden Mullins.Sliding doors vw,vw,px, px\"The first manager axed by the Pozzos has a pub named in honour of his success in his subsequent job One of the Pozzo family’s first acts after taking charge was to sack Sean Dyche in July  in favour of Zola.While they have cycled through managers at a dramatic rate since then, Dyche was appointed by Burnley less than four months later and remains in his post.He has twice taken the Clarets up to the Premier League, in his second and fourth seasons in charge with a relegation in between, and has established them in the top flight until this season’s fight against the drop. So highly regarded is he in Burnley that a pub in the town – The Royal Dyche – is named in his honour.Dyche is the longest-serving current Premier League manager, while in the EFL only Harrogate’s Simon Weaver – who spent  seasons with them in non-league before ’s promotion – and Wycombe’s Gareth Ainsworth have been in post longer..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: A look at Watford us turbulent managerial history under their current ownership article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
