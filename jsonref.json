Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, and they both said: “Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you”.’He added: ‘I was very proud.

I don’t have to, that’s my daughter.\u0027He also spoke about Meghan\u0027s upbringing, and how he and his ex-wife Doria were determined to not let their break-up affect their child.He said: \u0027We didn\u0027t express anger towards each other so she never felt that. Doria and I have always had a good relationship and she felt loved, there wasn’t a problem with that ever.\u0027Doria and I get along and we talk. I still bring her flowers every mother\u0027s day.

Others took decades.Christo and Jeanne-Claude first dreamed of a floating mastaba - Arabic for bench - in 1967. Initially it was to be built on Lake Michigan. Five decades later, it has finally arisen in London.Although plenty hated the structure, calling it \u0027hideous\u0027, \u0027intrusive\u0027 and an \u0027ego trip\u0027, others have taken a shine to the installation. One swimmer said: \u0027It makes a change from the wildlife. I\u0027m all in support of good art.\u0027Another added: \u0027There was a beautiful colour to the water this morning from the reflection.\u0027           Another claimed the structure, which rises 65 feet (20 meters) above the surface of the park\u0027s Serpentine Lake, added: \u0027It\u0027s an affront to nature\u0027Since 1977, Christo has been planning an even bigger version: a mastaba set in the Abu Dhabi desert that would be made from 410,000 barrels, rise 500 feet (150 meters) and constitute the largest sculpture in the world.Like Christo\u0027s other works, \u0027The London Mastaba\u0027 is temporary. At summer\u0027s end it will be dismantled and the barrels recycled, in keeping with Christo\u0027s \u0027leave no trace\u0027 philosophy.For now, it floats serenely, drawing a mixed reaction from the walkers, joggers and cyclists who use the park each day.Local Lucia Halpern, who watched the work being constructed in the park over two months, said her cockapoo Coco was a fan, \u0027because it keeps the ducks away and she can go in the water.\u0027But she declared herself \u0027a bit disappointed\u0027 by the structure.\u0027The only thing I find beautiful about it is the reflection in the water,\u0027 she said. \u0027Maybe that\u0027s the point.

The 73-year-old (pictured on GMB) described his sorrow about pulling out just three days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle because of heart surgery and admitted he was jealous but grateful that Prince Charles stepped inBut after my lengthy interview with him today, conducted with my GMB co-host Susanna Reid, I’ve changed my mind about this rather shy, gentle man whose life was irrevocably changed forever when Meghan fell in love with Harry.First, he fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging those pictures.‘I realize it was a serious mistake,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to take it back.’Second, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the tsunami of attention that cascaded on the poor guy’s head from the second the engagement was formally announced.His account of how he discovered the identity of Meghan’s new man was both comical and endearing: ‘The first phone calls were, “Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.” And I said, “That’s really nice.” And the next call was like, “He’s British,” and I said, ‘That’s really nice.” And eventually the third time around was like, “He’s a prince.” And at that point, she said, ‘It’s Harry.” And I said, ‘Oh, Harry, OK!’    Markle fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging pictures in an internet cafeFor a man eking out a quiet retirement of considerable solitude in a remote part of Mexico, this would prove to be a spectacularly inconvenient revelation, though he is far too proud of his daughter to admit it.To their shame, senior Palace officials didn’t immediately put someone on a plane to take care of Thomas Markle.One burly, wily ex Household Cavalry guard sitting outside Mr Markle’s front door all day - and none of the chaos that followed may have happened. Or why not just fly him to London a month early – it’s not like Kensington Palace doesn’t have enough bedrooms?Surely both Harry and Meghan must have known he’d be subjected to intense media scrutiny? Yet they did nothing to help him, leaving the former Hollywood lighting director to face the cameras himself for the first time like the proverbial rabbit in headlights.  Mr Markle revealed that his daughter (pictured together above) cried when he told her that he wasn\u0027t coming to London          Harry and his bride are seen on their wedding day as they leave St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor CastleI still find this failure to protect him incomprehensible, just as I find it weird that Meghan’s mother Doria had to go to the wedding entirely alone, that Harry STILL hasn’t met his father-in-law, that Meghan STILL hasn’t visited her father since his heart attack, and that Prince Charles has had NO contact with Thomas Markle despite taking his daughter down the aisle.But hey, all families are a bit weird – right?I believe Thomas when he says his motivation to do the staged photos was more about improving his dishevelled image than money.(Just as I believe his motivation for appearing on Good Morning Britain today for his first ever TV interview was more about setting the record straight than the relatively small fee we paid him.)There had been a steady flow of pictures of him looking like an overweight, unshaven, beer-swilling vagrant. Who wouldn’t be tempted to try to create a more positive ‘look’ for themselves in the run-up to starring in the biggest wedding of the year?I also believe him when he says he only wants the best for Meghan and Harry. Thomas Markle strikes me as a man who genuinely loves his daughter, and thinks Harry’s the really lucky one to have landed his ‘little Princess’.Marks \u0026 Meghan! The Duchess of Sussex teamed her £4K Oscar...\u0027Promise me you\u0027ll never raise your hand to my daughter\u0027:...\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027:...Share this articleOf course, there will be some who think he should have kept his mouth shut, just as I did in the run-up to the wedding.But that was then, and this is now.After all the feverish speculation, rumour and gossip surrounding the chaotic furore of that week, it was good to hear the truth from the horse’s mouth – told in a soft, thoughtful manner that most of our viewers seemed to find endearing and sincere.The Palace, which had no prior knowledge of our interview, will have gone into spasms of horror that Thomas revealed Harry’s views on Donald Trump and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.After all, the royals are trained to never give their political opinions about anything.But Harry’s views – according to Thomas, he’s ‘open to the Brexit experiment’ and thinks President Trump should be ‘given a chance’ - seem more diplomatic than especially controversial.If I were the Palace, and Meghan and Harry for that matter, I would bite my tongue and try to see Thomas Markle’s interview in the way he intended it to be: a candid, honest account of what it’s been like to live through the blazing firestorm of life as a first time father-of-a-royal-bride.    Thomas Markle said he was \u0027honoured\u0027 that the Prince of Wales took on the job of walking Meghan down the aisle insteadNone of us is perfect, and none of us would survive such intense scrutiny unscathed or without doing a few silly things along the way.I don’t doubt Thomas’s sincerity when he says he did what he thought was the right thing at the time.It wasn’t, and as he freely admits now, he’ll now have to live with that for the rest of his life.But any man who, as Thomas Markle does, travels to Los Angeles each year to place flowers on his ex wife Doria’s doorstep on Mother’s Day is not a bad man.In fact, after today’s interview, I’ve come to the conclusion he’s a thoroughly honourable, decent man who is understandably struggling to make sense of a crazy new existence that was entirely of someone else’s making - albeit someone he loves very dearly.He’s also having to do it with barely any support.I congratulate him on his courageous candour today, and wish him well with his recovery.As for his future as a royal father-in-law, I simply say this: good luck Thomas – you’ll need it!"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/14/4D5C0CF100000578-0-image-a-10_1529329982999.jpg","title":"Prince Charles joins Queen annual Garter Day service Windsor Castle","story":"Share this articleLook charming in prints like Sophie in a dress by Emilia WicksteadShop the current collection at MATCHESFASHION.COMIt\u0026#39s been a busy few months for the Royal Family.

What came to our sight was a pit that was nearly circular and 70 or 80 centimetres (27 to 31 inches) wide.\u0027 He immediately realised he could have stumped upon something valuable. He said: \u0027I instantly had a familiar feeling.\u0027 Mr Tang said he and Mr Liu then found more pits stretching as far as eyes can see.\u0027Although the temperature was low, we were already warmed up by the excitement of the discovery,\u0027 wrote Mr Tang.  A team of Chinese experts visited the area in 2017 after learning about the fossils from Mr Tang. Their discovery was recently published.          Precious findings: Professor Xing Lida is pictured inspecting one footprint in Tancheng  Scientists have also found four \u0027unprecedented\u0027 two-toe dinosaur tracks which are parallel (one footprint is pictured on the right). Professor Xing said the tracks were left by deinonychus dinosaurs, which had three toes but their third toe never touched the ground (as pictured left)\u0027The ersity of the dinosaur footprints is truly shocking, \u0027 said Chinese palaeontologist Wang Xiaoli. \u0027No dinosaur skeletons have ever been found in this area. Only footprints could tell us what kinds of dinosaurs used to live here,\u0027 said professor Wang, who is the head of the Institute of Paleontology and Geology at Linyi University.The group of footprints came from carnivorous dinosaurs and phytophagous dinosaurs, including flying dinosaurs.          The fossil site is situated in Tancheng County\u0027s Li Zhuang Town, in China\u0027s Shandong ProvincePerhaps the most exciting discovery from the site is that the deinonychus dinosaurs - previously thought to be solitary - lived in groups.Scientists drew the conclusion after discovering four \u0027unprecedented\u0027 two-toe dinosaur tracks which are constantly parallel.Researchers explained that most of the two-toe footprints from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were left by deinonychus dinosaurs. The genus of carnivores includes the velociraptors which were made famous by film series Jurassic Park.\u0027Each footprint measures seven to eight centimetres (2.7 to 3.1 inches). They compose four tracks that continue to run parallel to each other,\u0027 said Dr. Xing Lida, one of the researchers and an associated professor from China University of Geosciences, Beijing.\u0027This is the typical trait of gregarious animals,\u0027 Dr. Xing said.          Experts discover the deinonychus dinosaurs - previously thought to be solitary  - lived in groups. The genus  includes the velociraptors (pictured) made famous by Jurassic ParkThese deinonychus dinosaurs were thought to be about one metre (3.2 feet) long and could run as fast as 2.4 metres (7.8 feet) per second. According to Prof. Martin Lockley, an expert in dinosaur tracks, the types of dinosaurs which used to roam Lizhuang town were \u0027very erse\u0027.Prof. Lockley said that the smallest meat eaters are only 50 centimetres long while the longest meat eaters could measure four metres (13 feet). They lived together with large plant eaters as long as 10 metres.The team\u0027s findings have been published on science journal Cretaceous Research."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/17/0080160300000258-0-image-a-1_1529339823791.jpg","title":"World Cup 2018 9 Russian foods eat FIFA football tournament","story":"Beef StroganoffReportedly first mentioned in print in 1871, beef stroganoff involves having thin strips of beef, mushrooms and onions sauteed in white wine and served with a creamy sauce.

She has been working at the Department for Education for eight months.In April 2016, Miss McDermott posted a picture of herself inside No 10 on Instagram, captioned: ‘My office for the day. My job is better than yours.’The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-level.Arriving on the ITV2 show in Majorca, she told her fellow contestants she ‘works in the government’.          The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-levelWhen asked if she was responsible for making laws, she replied ‘yeah, in essence’. She is appearing on the show after being granted an unpaid career break by the DfE in line with civil service rules, which state civil servants can have a career break of between three months and two years.It is thought DfE bosses might not necessarily have known she wanted the break in order to appear on Love Island.While the show’s controversial nature may raise eyebrows among Miss McDermott’s employers, her mother Karen insisted she was proud of her. Speaking about her ‘very academic’ daughter, Mrs McDermott, 56, added: ‘We’re behind her 100 per cent. She obviously spoke to us when she was first talking to the show and said she wouldn’t do it if we didn’t want her to.‘We told her to enjoy it and have the best experience of her life. We hope she finds her man.’ She said daughter ‘loves her job’ and is ‘passionate about making a difference’. All civil servants must uphold the civil service code – which says workers must show integrity and professionalism while away from government – while on a career break. If these terms were broken, human resources would be notified and would launch an investigation.However, workers who keep to the terms may return to work as normal. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/21/4D633CF600000578-0-image-a-14_1529355138016.jpg","title":"Now thats royal tea party Meghan Markels dress Queens hat Eugenies frock","story":"    Say cheese, Ma\u0027am: The Queen wears a hat to match a Wedgwood cheddar dish at the polo on Sunday¿I¿ve changed my mind about Meghan¿s dad ¿ he¿s just a shy,...Share this article    Don\u0027t put it in the dishwasher: Meghan in her plate pattern dress at a wedding on Saturday          Spot the inspiration: Kate channels the Polka Dot china collection by Royal Vale          Someone\u0027s blossoming: Pregnant Pippa plumped for the delicate look of a flowery teacup at the Royal Wedding          Saucer sorcery: Camilla\u0027s jacket at yesterday\u0027s Order of the Garter Service nods to the Royal Albert Black Diamond pattern          I\u0027m a little teapot: Princess Eugenie\u0027s poppy outfit is as chintzy as this pot          Roses are red...

Mr Markle (pictured with his daughter) exposed some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets          To be wrong-footed once as they were when the duchess\u0027s father announced he would not be giving Meghan away may be unfortunate. Pictured, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle kiss on their wedding    In his interview on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, Mr Markle spoke of his telephone conversations with Harry to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)Four weeks ago, old royal hands were left wondering why more effort hadn\u0027t been taken to ensure that Meghan\u0027s father was properly brought into his daughter\u0027s new world.Instead, aides were left floundering when it emerged that Mr Markle had foolishly participated in the staging of paparazzi pictures. The irony was that this act of invading his own privacy came at the very time Kensington Palace was sending strict warnings to the media not to harass him.It was hard to escape the conclusion that royal advisers had failed to realise that this lonely man — who lives in a run-down, Mexican border town — would struggle to deal with the enormity of his daughter marrying into the Royal Family.Why, they were asked, hadn\u0027t Mr Markle been helped? A consular official from the British embassy in Mexico City could have been sent up to brief him or even one of Prince Charles\u0027s more experienced aides flown out to acclimatise him.Yesterday, as they did a month ago, sources murmured that offers of assistance had been made to the former TV lighting director. Aides were reluctant to say more, but many thought that as soon as the wedding was over steps would have been taken to ensure Mr Markle felt he was part of the family.          Meghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (left, with Prince Charles and Camilla) received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the weddingThis might mean a new home, paid for by his wealthy son-in-law, and with an income to support himself and where he would have no need to give interviews for cash. At the very least one might have expected the newly-weds to have visited him by now – or arranged for him to visit them. His treatment – or rather a lack of it – contrasts wildly with that extended to his ex-wife and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland. RICHARD KAY: Bouquet of her favourite forget-me-nots, flash of her dazzling aquamarine ring but most tantalising of all... was empty seat at the royal wedding REALLY for Diana?The boyfriend Meghan would rather forget: How a 22-year-old Miss Markle dated an award winning PORN STAR among a host of other young suitorsHow Prince Louis is named after a colossus of the empire cruelly cut down by the IRA who was implicated in a military plot to overthrow Labour PM Harold Wilson and whose wife was a voracious sexual adventurousRICHARD KAY: Charles still hasn’t seen the newborn prince because he has a difficult relationship with William RICHARD KAY asks the tantalising question: Will Kate copy the Queen with baby No 4? RICHARD KAY: The touching rituals that reveal just how much the Queen loved her corgis...they\u0027re buried at her favourite homes, each with a headstone on which she leaves posies of flowers.

Thomas Markle, thus far, seems to be excluded from it. One can only imagine how frustrating this must be for Prince Harry. Determined to protect his wife in the way he was never able to protect his late mother, Diana, the response of the Palace to Meghan\u0027s father has fallen short.Of one thing we can be sure: he will not be overly embarrassed that his views on Trump and the EU have emerged. One figure who has known the prince since he was a boy, says: \u0027You could say he handled a tricky conversation well. When asked about Brexit he was trying to be non-committal and on Trump he didn\u0027t want to be rude.\u0027A less generous view was being taken elsewhere however. As a young man whose experiences of America come from his time training with the US military and that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas, he might be disposed to thinking positively about Trump.Indeed the royals have followed Trump\u0027s rise closely. At a charity lunch before the 2016 US election, Prince Charles asked an American sitting next to him what Trump was like.    Mr Markle\u0027s assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive          Ever since Trump (pictured) became US President, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matterThe guest later admitted she was flustered because she didn\u0027t think royals talked about political figures. Perhaps this accounts for the sympathy that exists at Clarence House for this latest imbroglio involving Meghan\u0027s father.\u0027Prince Charles and Camilla like Meghan enormously, but they do feel that the team around her and Harry is rather inexperienced,\u0027 says an insider.Others, though, feel that the duchess herself could have done more to avoid difficulties. It is worth recalling that according to Meghan\u0027s biographer Andrew Morton, the former actress has long become used to compartmentalising her life.When success with TV series Suits arrived, she purged many childhood friends. Some might argue she has done the same with her close family. Her mother, after all, was the solitary representative of blood relatives at her daughter\u0027s wedding. Inevitably, those around the royals were comparing Mr Markle with another royal-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father Michael Middleton.He has only ever spoken once – and then under strict Palace control – when his daughter became engaged to Prince William. In the near eight years since, he has said nothing.Sadly – with a little more due diligence – this Markle debacle Part 2 might have been wholly avoided. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/23/4D641D2F00000578-5858449-image-m-9_1529361093226.jpg","title":"Is bird Hilarious moment cockatoo barks dog New York City park","story":"A little dog became confused after a cockatoo started barking at him in a New York Park          The dog-like sound produced by Violet, the white feathered bird, made everyone laughWhat exactly is this?

It taught employees to work for free or cheap to show devotion.

The shorter of the two was born Dora Herms in 1888 in Berlin, and often appeared in shows as \u0027Brunhilde\u0027. She married William Van Droysen in 1918, made her way to the US and starred in the legendary Barnum and Bailey circus in 1922. Meanwhile, the other \u0027sister\u0027 - Annie Haase - was born in 1906, also in Berlin. She joined her fellow giantess in 1926 and toured as \u0027Elsie and Hilda - the Van Droysen Sisters\u0027.

The 73-year-old (pictured on GMB) described his sorrow about pulling out just three days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle because of heart surgery and admitted he was jealous but grateful that Prince Charles stepped inBut after my lengthy interview with him today, conducted with my GMB co-host Susanna Reid, I’ve changed my mind about this rather shy, gentle man whose life was irrevocably changed forever when Meghan fell in love with Harry.First, he fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging those pictures.‘I realize it was a serious mistake,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to take it back.’Second, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the tsunami of attention that cascaded on the poor guy’s head from the second the engagement was formally announced.His account of how he discovered the identity of Meghan’s new man was both comical and endearing: ‘The first phone calls were, “Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.” And I said, “That’s really nice.” And the next call was like, “He’s British,” and I said, ‘That’s really nice.” And eventually the third time around was like, “He’s a prince.” And at that point, she said, ‘It’s Harry.” And I said, ‘Oh, Harry, OK!’    Markle fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging pictures in an internet cafeFor a man eking out a quiet retirement of considerable solitude in a remote part of Mexico, this would prove to be a spectacularly inconvenient revelation, though he is far too proud of his daughter to admit it.To their shame, senior Palace officials didn’t immediately put someone on a plane to take care of Thomas Markle.One burly, wily ex Household Cavalry guard sitting outside Mr Markle’s front door all day - and none of the chaos that followed may have happened. Or why not just fly him to London a month early – it’s not like Kensington Palace doesn’t have enough bedrooms?Surely both Harry and Meghan must have known he’d be subjected to intense media scrutiny? Yet they did nothing to help him, leaving the former Hollywood lighting director to face the cameras himself for the first time like the proverbial rabbit in headlights.  Mr Markle revealed that his daughter (pictured together above) cried when he told her that he wasn\u0027t coming to London          Harry and his bride are seen on their wedding day as they leave St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor CastleI still find this failure to protect him incomprehensible, just as I find it weird that Meghan’s mother Doria had to go to the wedding entirely alone, that Harry STILL hasn’t met his father-in-law, that Meghan STILL hasn’t visited her father since his heart attack, and that Prince Charles has had NO contact with Thomas Markle despite taking his daughter down the aisle.But hey, all families are a bit weird – right?I believe Thomas when he says his motivation to do the staged photos was more about improving his dishevelled image than money.(Just as I believe his motivation for appearing on Good Morning Britain today for his first ever TV interview was more about setting the record straight than the relatively small fee we paid him.)There had been a steady flow of pictures of him looking like an overweight, unshaven, beer-swilling vagrant. Who wouldn’t be tempted to try to create a more positive ‘look’ for themselves in the run-up to starring in the biggest wedding of the year?I also believe him when he says he only wants the best for Meghan and Harry. Thomas Markle strikes me as a man who genuinely loves his daughter, and thinks Harry’s the really lucky one to have landed his ‘little Princess’.Marks \u0026 Meghan! The Duchess of Sussex teamed her £4K Oscar...\u0027Promise me you\u0027ll never raise your hand to my daughter\u0027:...\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027:...Share this articleOf course, there will be some who think he should have kept his mouth shut, just as I did in the run-up to the wedding.But that was then, and this is now.After all the feverish speculation, rumour and gossip surrounding the chaotic furore of that week, it was good to hear the truth from the horse’s mouth – told in a soft, thoughtful manner that most of our viewers seemed to find endearing and sincere.The Palace, which had no prior knowledge of our interview, will have gone into spasms of horror that Thomas revealed Harry’s views on Donald Trump and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.After all, the royals are trained to never give their political opinions about anything.But Harry’s views – according to Thomas, he’s ‘open to the Brexit experiment’ and thinks President Trump should be ‘given a chance’ - seem more diplomatic than especially controversial.If I were the Palace, and Meghan and Harry for that matter, I would bite my tongue and try to see Thomas Markle’s interview in the way he intended it to be: a candid, honest account of what it’s been like to live through the blazing firestorm of life as a first time father-of-a-royal-bride.    Thomas Markle said he was \u0027honoured\u0027 that the Prince of Wales took on the job of walking Meghan down the aisle insteadNone of us is perfect, and none of us would survive such intense scrutiny unscathed or without doing a few silly things along the way.I don’t doubt Thomas’s sincerity when he says he did what he thought was the right thing at the time.It wasn’t, and as he freely admits now, he’ll now have to live with that for the rest of his life.But any man who, as Thomas Markle does, travels to Los Angeles each year to place flowers on his ex wife Doria’s doorstep on Mother’s Day is not a bad man.In fact, after today’s interview, I’ve come to the conclusion he’s a thoroughly honourable, decent man who is understandably struggling to make sense of a crazy new existence that was entirely of someone else’s making - albeit someone he loves very dearly.He’s also having to do it with barely any support.I congratulate him on his courageous candour today, and wish him well with his recovery.As for his future as a royal father-in-law, I simply say this: good luck Thomas – you’ll need it!"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/11/4D5F1D5100000578-5857441-image-a-20_1529405018673.jpg","title":"1 2mn year old dinosaur tracks shockingly diverse footprints found","story":"    Incredible discovery: A fossil site containing hundreds of precious dinosaur footprints has been found in Tangcheng County, east China.

What came to our sight was a pit that was nearly circular and 70 or 80 centimetres (27 to 31 inches) wide.\u0027 He immediately realised he could have stumped upon something valuable. He said: \u0027I instantly had a familiar feeling.\u0027 Mr Tang said he and Mr Liu then found more pits stretching as far as eyes can see.\u0027Although the temperature was low, we were already warmed up by the excitement of the discovery,\u0027 wrote Mr Tang.  A team of Chinese experts visited the area in 2017 after learning about the fossils from Mr Tang. Their discovery was recently published.          Precious findings: Professor Xing Lida is pictured inspecting one footprint in Tancheng  Scientists have also found four \u0027unprecedented\u0027 two-toe dinosaur tracks which are parallel (one footprint is pictured on the right). Professor Xing said the tracks were left by deinonychus dinosaurs, which had three toes but their third toe never touched the ground (as pictured left)\u0027The ersity of the dinosaur footprints is truly shocking, \u0027 said Chinese palaeontologist Wang Xiaoli. \u0027No dinosaur skeletons have ever been found in this area. Only footprints could tell us what kinds of dinosaurs used to live here,\u0027 said professor Wang, who is the head of the Institute of Paleontology and Geology at Linyi University.The group of footprints came from carnivorous dinosaurs and phytophagous dinosaurs, including flying dinosaurs.          The fossil site is situated in Tancheng County\u0027s Li Zhuang Town, in China\u0027s Shandong ProvincePerhaps the most exciting discovery from the site is that the deinonychus dinosaurs - previously thought to be solitary - lived in groups.Scientists drew the conclusion after discovering four \u0027unprecedented\u0027 two-toe dinosaur tracks which are constantly parallel.Researchers explained that most of the two-toe footprints from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were left by deinonychus dinosaurs. The genus of carnivores includes the velociraptors which were made famous by film series Jurassic Park.\u0027Each footprint measures seven to eight centimetres (2.7 to 3.1 inches). They compose four tracks that continue to run parallel to each other,\u0027 said Dr. Xing Lida, one of the researchers and an associated professor from China University of Geosciences, Beijing.\u0027This is the typical trait of gregarious animals,\u0027 Dr. Xing said.          Experts discover the deinonychus dinosaurs - previously thought to be solitary  - lived in groups. The genus  includes the velociraptors (pictured) made famous by Jurassic ParkThese deinonychus dinosaurs were thought to be about one metre (3.2 feet) long and could run as fast as 2.4 metres (7.8 feet) per second. According to Prof. Martin Lockley, an expert in dinosaur tracks, the types of dinosaurs which used to roam Lizhuang town were \u0027very erse\u0027.Prof. Lockley said that the smallest meat eaters are only 50 centimetres long while the longest meat eaters could measure four metres (13 feet). They lived together with large plant eaters as long as 10 metres.The team\u0027s findings have been published on science journal Cretaceous Research."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/11/4D677C1D00000578-5857921-image-m-47_1529405960959.jpg","title":"England fans pack pubs Britain Group G fixture against Tunisia","story":"One over-excited England fan was filmed on the bonnet of a car as it tried to push its way through the crowds in Plymouth on Monday evening before the vehicle braked and threw him off    Another video shows the fan holding an arm aloft as he jumps on the bonnet of the car      A number of jubilant supporters were filmed trying to clamber onto the bonnet of a car as it tried to push its way through the crowds there on Monday evening          The fan clings on to the windscreen of the car as it speeds off from the crowd, before it breaks suddenly  With one fan - dressed in a red England shirt - clinging onto the bonnet, the car is seen speeding up then braking suddenly, throwing the man off and into the middle of the street\u0027I was just relieved to see the man get to back his feet so quickly.\u0027My heart really was in my mouth for a few seconds, as his head could so easily have smashed into the road.\u0027I really don\u0027t know what the driver was thinking.

Mr Markle (pictured with his daughter) exposed some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets          To be wrong-footed once as they were when the duchess\u0027s father announced he would not be giving Meghan away may be unfortunate. Pictured, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle kiss on their wedding    In his interview on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, Mr Markle spoke of his telephone conversations with Harry to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)Four weeks ago, old royal hands were left wondering why more effort hadn\u0027t been taken to ensure that Meghan\u0027s father was properly brought into his daughter\u0027s new world.Instead, aides were left floundering when it emerged that Mr Markle had foolishly participated in the staging of paparazzi pictures. The irony was that this act of invading his own privacy came at the very time Kensington Palace was sending strict warnings to the media not to harass him.It was hard to escape the conclusion that royal advisers had failed to realise that this lonely man — who lives in a run-down, Mexican border town — would struggle to deal with the enormity of his daughter marrying into the Royal Family.Why, they were asked, hadn\u0027t Mr Markle been helped? A consular official from the British embassy in Mexico City could have been sent up to brief him or even one of Prince Charles\u0027s more experienced aides flown out to acclimatise him.Yesterday, as they did a month ago, sources murmured that offers of assistance had been made to the former TV lighting director. Aides were reluctant to say more, but many thought that as soon as the wedding was over steps would have been taken to ensure Mr Markle felt he was part of the family.          Meghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (left, with Prince Charles and Camilla) received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the weddingThis might mean a new home, paid for by his wealthy son-in-law, and with an income to support himself and where he would have no need to give interviews for cash. At the very least one might have expected the newly-weds to have visited him by now – or arranged for him to visit them. His treatment – or rather a lack of it – contrasts wildly with that extended to his ex-wife and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland. RICHARD KAY: Bouquet of her favourite forget-me-nots, flash of her dazzling aquamarine ring but most tantalising of all... was empty seat at the royal wedding REALLY for Diana?The boyfriend Meghan would rather forget: How a 22-year-old Miss Markle dated an award winning PORN STAR among a host of other young suitorsHow Prince Louis is named after a colossus of the empire cruelly cut down by the IRA who was implicated in a military plot to overthrow Labour PM Harold Wilson and whose wife was a voracious sexual adventurousRICHARD KAY: Charles still hasn’t seen the newborn prince because he has a difficult relationship with William RICHARD KAY asks the tantalising question: Will Kate copy the Queen with baby No 4? RICHARD KAY: The touching rituals that reveal just how much the Queen loved her corgis...they\u0027re buried at her favourite homes, each with a headstone on which she leaves posies of flowers.

Thomas Markle, thus far, seems to be excluded from it. One can only imagine how frustrating this must be for Prince Harry. Determined to protect his wife in the way he was never able to protect his late mother, Diana, the response of the Palace to Meghan\u0027s father has fallen short.Of one thing we can be sure: he will not be overly embarrassed that his views on Trump and the EU have emerged. One figure who has known the prince since he was a boy, says: \u0027You could say he handled a tricky conversation well. When asked about Brexit he was trying to be non-committal and on Trump he didn\u0027t want to be rude.\u0027A less generous view was being taken elsewhere however. As a young man whose experiences of America come from his time training with the US military and that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas, he might be disposed to thinking positively about Trump.Indeed the royals have followed Trump\u0027s rise closely. At a charity lunch before the 2016 US election, Prince Charles asked an American sitting next to him what Trump was like.    Mr Markle\u0027s assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive          Ever since Trump (pictured) became US President, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matterThe guest later admitted she was flustered because she didn\u0027t think royals talked about political figures. Perhaps this accounts for the sympathy that exists at Clarence House for this latest imbroglio involving Meghan\u0027s father.\u0027Prince Charles and Camilla like Meghan enormously, but they do feel that the team around her and Harry is rather inexperienced,\u0027 says an insider.Others, though, feel that the duchess herself could have done more to avoid difficulties. It is worth recalling that according to Meghan\u0027s biographer Andrew Morton, the former actress has long become used to compartmentalising her life.When success with TV series Suits arrived, she purged many childhood friends. Some might argue she has done the same with her close family. Her mother, after all, was the solitary representative of blood relatives at her daughter\u0027s wedding. Inevitably, those around the royals were comparing Mr Markle with another royal-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father Michael Middleton.He has only ever spoken once – and then under strict Palace control – when his daughter became engaged to Prince William. In the near eight years since, he has said nothing.Sadly – with a little more due diligence – this Markle debacle Part 2 might have been wholly avoided. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/23/4D641D2F00000578-5858449-image-m-9_1529361093226.jpg","title":"Is bird Hilarious moment cockatoo barks dog New York City park","story":"A little dog became confused after a cockatoo started barking at him in a New York Park          The dog-like sound produced by Violet, the white feathered bird, made everyone laughWhat exactly is this?

Which leads to one very relevant question: has Musk actually read any of Banks’s books? In a series of novels, the Scottish author explored “the Culture”: a post-scarcity, hedonistic society where you could create your own drugs in your own body, change gender at will and where freedom was the highest and noblest sign of a civilisation.But there is a darker side to the Culture. The playground of pleasures is overseen by vast intelligent machines that, on whim sometimes, make their own decisions about what is best for their pet beings. In each novel, the Culture faces an enemy that does not agree with their values. The Culture objects to the Idirans’ religion, and the Affront’s monstrous brutality. For the Chelgrians, the Culture caused a caste war, then covered it up for the Gzilt, they wanted them not to “sublime”, or transcend the known universe. Worse than that, we have the frequently mentioned “Special Circumstances”: a group who are frequently involved in the Culture’s machinations. They intervene, they assassinate, they hide. Special Circumstances is a tiny variation on the old question for politics students: how far can a liberal society go in defence of liberalism?The cold answer in these novels is: to any extent. When I interviewed Banks, just before his untimely death in 2013 at the age of 59, we talked about why the Culture did not sublime like other species. He was adamantine: the Culture would stay until everything else in the universe was like them. Not exactly utopian, not exactly anarchist.So it is worrying that a tech entrepreneur thinks that a totalitarian, interventionist monolith is a role model.

The new price rise adds a further £55 a year for a typical dual fuel customer from 16 August, and could signal the start of a new round of increases.Shell-owned First Utility and fast-growing challenger supplier Bulb both announced price rises last week, which take effect later this summer.E.ON blamed higher wholesale energy costs, which it said had increased by more than a fifth since its last big price rise in 2017.Michael Lewis, the E.ON UK chief executive, said: “A number of costs have risen quite sharply and in particular we’ve experienced a hike in the price we have to pay for the energy our customers need, partly driven by the beast from the east and extreme weather conditions experienced earlier this year.”A customer with typical energy consumption will now face an annual bill of £1,208 after the rise. Victoria Arrington, spokesperson for comparison site Energyhelpine said: “This new rise is a bitter and expensive pill to swallow.”The timing of the rise risks creating a political backlash, as the energy regulator Ofgem is bringing in the government’s cap on standard variable tariffs by the end of the year. MoneySuperMarket said the cap would not be enough to compensate households hit by price hikes.E.ON said it was contacting customers to suggest they switch to cheaper fixed tariffs, and offering them measures to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.Wholesale power prices usually fall in summer as demand is lower.

A traditionally friendly and predictable gathering of like-minded countries was marred by finger-pointing and disagreement, resulting in an inability to achieve consensus on a final communiqué. But, while political analysts were quick to declare the end of the G7’s coherence, integrity, and usefulness, markets were unfazed. In fact, the longer-term outcome may well prove markets right, albeit with some important qualifications.Participants at the G7 summit reportedly clashed over issues such as climate change and the possibility of readmitting Russia. But the highly publicised discord was fuelled mainly by disagreements over the effects of trade among the members. Those disagreements – amplified by persistent differences on basic facts – impeded progress in other areas where greater consensus might have been possible, including Iran, some other Middle East issues, North Korea, migration and refugee relief.Representatives of the US accused the other G7 members of “unfair trade practices”, which they claim have disproportionately harmed the American economy and its workers. The rest of the G7 – all traditional US allies – confronted Donald Trump with data that they hoped would prove that trade had been highly beneficial to all countries.But the US held firm to its stance. Without concessions from its trading partners, including more reciprocity, the US, its government representatives unequivocally declared, would implement new tariffs on imports from Canada, the EU and Japan.This approach marks a sharp departure from the past, and another shock to the establishment and expert opinion. While some tweaks to trade relations are needed, in the past such changes would have been pursued in an orderly and cooperative fashion – not under constant and growing tariff pressure. Instead, the major economies of the geopolitical west seem set to engage in a tit-for-tat tariff dispute that could escalate into a fill-blown trade war harming all of its members.But it is not only other western economies that had the US up in arms. The Trump administration is pressuring China to address intellectual property theft and to reduce non-tariff barriers (such as joint-venture requirements). Here, all other G7 members agree that America’s grievances are legitimate, and that they are being harmed as well.Yet, given conflict over intra-G7 trade, the group was unable to unite on a comprehensive and coordinated response to China. The summit was followed by an escalation of the trade dispute between China and the US, compounding the uncertainty now jeopardising a synchronised growth pick-up that, owing to insufficient policy reforms, is already running out of steam in many countries other than the US.The failed G7 summit dealt a very public blow to a once-powerful grouping that had already been challenged by global economic re-alignment, the emergence of the more representative G20, and new forms of regionalism. So it is perhaps not surprising that some political scientists have declared the end of the G7. Yet, when markets opened on Monday morning, they were utterly unaffected by the weekend’s developments for them, the G7 summit had essentially been a non-event.On one level, this disparity can be explained by the fact that G7 infighting will have only a small and narrow impact on growth, especially compared to factors like monetary policy. More fundamentally, markets have been conditioned to postpone significant price adjustments until there is overwhelming evidence of negative economic and financial effects.In recent years, markets have faced an unusually large (and expanding) set of unconventional political statements and manoeuvres. But, for the most part, the rhetoric has not been translated into reality, and what actions have been taken proved largely inconsequential for economic activity and asset prices.That was true of Trump’s rhetorical sparring match last year with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which some political analysts predicted would lead to armed conflict. It was also the case with rising Russian revanchism, which some viewed as a precursor to a disruptive new cold war, and the electoral success of eurosceptic and populist parties in the EU, which some declared would lead to the union’s dissolution.For markets, waiting for strong evidence of an economic impact, rather than reacting to every statement or event, has proved profitable. That is likely to be the right approach for the G7 summit, too – and not just because the body’s impact on global outcomes has diminished in recent years. Given the large number of longstanding economic, financial, institutional, political and social links among the G7’s members – all of which act as stabilisers – this month’s summit may well be followed by a more congenial and constructive one.The G7 has not been dealt a fatal blow it still can and will play a role on the global stage – albeit a less important one. But that does not mean that the debacle in Canada will be cost-free. G7 members lost a valuable opportunity to develop common positions on issues about which they could agree, and the rest of the world was shown more evidence that the global system’s longstanding core-periphery relations are no longer reliably buttressed by unity among established economic and financial powers. At a time of considerable political and social fluidity, destabilising the remaining anchors represents a risk to the system as a whole.• Mohamed A El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz and was chairman of Barack Obama’s Global Development Council"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88be5207d913fa164e03bd33f1d4fd846ce70cf0/0_0_1406_2000/master/1406.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d1838e1dda2e88db6b76011b5f9bba40 1440w","title":"david dimbleby mary berry question time","story":"Question Time is a tetchy show for a tetchy nation. For our sanity, I say we replace one benevolent ringmaster with anotherWith a calm authority in his timbre and a cheeky twinkle in his eye, David Dimbleby – the nation’s Dumbledore - has expertly guided the show through its golden age, harnessing all the rage and energy of modern Britain into an improbably palatable hour of weekly TV. How can it possibly go on without him? The runners and riders are already in place: Kirsty Wark is the bookies’ favourite, Emily Maitlis is not far behind, and Samira Ahmed has boldly applied for the role via Twitter. There are surprisingly few male names being mentioned, with Maria Miller MP – the chair of the parliamentary women and equalities select committee – leading calls for the BBC to appoint a woman to the role for the first time.At least the format itself is cast-iron strong. While other TV shows have to evolve to keep up with society, Question Time has stood still and waited for society to catch up with it. Remember, when it started in 1979, there wasn’t quite such a surfeit of livid opinion among the British public as there is today. These were the days when politics, like religion, was still regarded as an out-of-bounds topic for everyday conversation.Nowadays, every last idiot you pass on the street has an enormous and inflexible position on everything. Question Time is a weekly snapshot of where the debate currently stands, neatly encapsulating the wild cacophony of opinion that has raged all week on Twitter and beyond.For most frontbench politicians, an invite to appear on Question Time represents an unwelcome chore. They are put in a position where they have nothing to gain and everything to lose: they must attempt to simultaneously toe the party line, deflect attacks from their fellow panellists and satisfy their interrogators in the audience. To do any one of those things in isolation is almost impossible. To attempt all three at once is futile. But someone has to do it and if you say no too many times then your party whip or the leadership office will mark you down as a shirking bottle-job with no stomach for frontline battle.If you’re just a humble journalist or gobshite for hire, you’re there mostly because it’s nice to be asked and so you can’t go far wrong as long as you don’t try and look clever. I have friends who have spent more time studying for a single hour on Question Time than they ever did for their GCSEs and A-levels combined. Mind you, I also once sat in a room and witnessed a prominent frontbencher almost reduced to tears as a party spin doctor aggressively coached them for a Question Time appearance in much the same style as Louis Gossett Jr trained Richard Gere in An Officer and a Gentleman.But it is audience members who have provided the stand-out moments of recent years: from the Great Wall Of Gammon (the term coined on Twitter by Ben Davis in 2017 to describe a collage of angry, white, middle-aged audience members) to mum of four Michelle Dorrell, who tearfully attacked Amber Rudd over the government’s cutting of tax credits in 2015. Like a reality show for politicos, Question Time now has the capacity to turn civilians into semi-celebrities overnight. There was the “I want my country back” woman of 2016, and the man who memorably asked the panel if they “watched the internet?” in a debate about refugees.Dimbleby is the benevolent ringmaster who lends charm and humanity to what would otherwise be a grotesque spectacle of conflict no more edifying than watching a gang of Staffies fighting in a pub car park. One simple chuckle or exasperated aside from Double D is enough to diffuse even the most furious of disputes, and remind us that this all supposed to be a bit of Thursday night fun.For that reason, the BBC would be foolish to go back down the Robin Day route and replace Dimbleby with a clever-clogs or a sour puss like Nick Robinson or Jeremy Paxman. What Brexit Britain needs now more than ever is someone – male or female – who can give us all a bit of a cuddle with their twinkly eyes and tell us that, however mad we all get with each other, everything will probably be alright in the end.

But it feels unethical to help fund a regime that is becoming increasingly totalitarianWhy would anyone choose to live in the US any more? If you are not fleeing desperate circumstances (and Brexit does not yet qualify), why would you willingly make the US your home?I have been asking myself this a lot lately. I was born in London and I have a British passport, but I have been living in New York City for seven years. I love New York. However, the city has a fatal flaw: it is in the US. And the US, you may have noticed, has becoming terrifyingly totalitarian. It is starting to feel unethical to be an expat here. After all, it does not matter how much you #Resist – there is no getting past the fact that electing to live in the US means paying taxes to Donald Trump’s administration. It means helping to fund a government that is ripping children detained at the border from their parents and placing them in cages. It means being complicit in Trump’s morally bankrupt regime.Of course, wherever in the world you live, your taxes generally help to fund something awful. As a legal resident but non-citizen of the US, however, I am subject to taxation without representation. I cannot attempt to control where my tax dollars go by voting for a particular political candidate. I can, however, choose not to pay US taxes by extricating myself from the country. As an expat, I am in the privileged position of being able to vote with my feet and my finances.I know lots of Britons in the US. We all think of ourselves – and are generally thought of – as “expats”, rather than “migrants” or “immigrants”. But that word is applied only to a select few. Excepting certain intra-European nuances, the rule of thumb seems to be that anyone who possesses a western passport and moves to another country is an expat, never a migrant. This is not just semantics the differences in meaning between “expat” and the more dehumanising “migrant” and “immigrant” are important to parse, because they shine a light on the double standards applied to international migration. Being able to think of yourself as an “expat” is a luxury few people have. It is certainly not a luxury enjoyed by the children being separated from their parents as part of the US’s immigration policy. In a US increasingly hostile to foreigners, those of us who qualify (for now, at least) as the “right” sort of foreigner must start thinking about how ethical it is to passively enjoy our privileged positions.But you know what? Let’s forget Trump for a minute. Because, even if you leave all the ethical considerations aside, the US has long ceased to be a place anyone except the very wealthy or the very desperate would rationally choose to live. There is the country’s inequitable healthcare system, for one thing being poor and sick is basically a death sentence here. Then there is the US’s embarrassing lack of parental leave and its deadly obsession with guns. Why on earth would you choose to live in a country where kids get bulletproof shields for their backpacks as a gift for graduating middle school?I am not packing up and leaving the US yet, mainly because I have not persuaded my American partner to relocate to Brexit Britain. So, this is not my “Goodbye to New York” essay. However, it is a requiem of sorts for the US. There was a time I considered the US to be a land of opportunity. But unless your last name is Trump, the American dream is dead.

In the past year alone, he had a number one Billboard album, was banned from Spotify, dropped by his record label and charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant victim and witness tampering.His ex-girlfriend detailed the most horrendous abuse in court documents and press interviews. He will be remembered mostly for the unusually cruel violence he committed on vulnerable people, particularly his ex-girlfriend, crimes for which he never expressed remorse.His music, a combination of hip-hop and emo that was depressive, and at times devastating, reflected a life lived with disregard for humanity, both other people’s and his own. On Monday afternoon, he was shot and killed in Miami, during an armed robbery. He was 20 years old.His life had many of the trappings of gangsta rappers who were shot at a young age in the 1990s: drugs, violence and persistent trouble with the law. But XXXTentacion, real name Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, was not exactly a hard man. He was insecure and drug-addled, still living through his own traumatic childhood while he viciously abused others. His victims were not from rival gangs: they were women and strangers. His music rarely tried to demonstrate bravado or material gains, it mostly traced round mental illness, suicide, extreme misogyny and a prevailing feeling of numbness.Onfroy was born in Florida in 1998. His mother was financially unable, and at times just uninterested, in raising him, and he spent much of his childhood moving from home to home. The bond he had with her, he has repeatedly claimed, was incredibly strong. When she was in the picture he said she would shower him with gifts and affection. When she was away, a darkness and depression ate away at him, one that would define his short life.Onfroy was constantly in trouble for violent behaviour, and was at one point expelled from school for beating up another student. By the time he was 17, he had already been charged with possession of a firearm, armed robbery, resisting arrest and Xanax possession. He had done two spells in juvenile detention and during the second one, violently beat a cellmate who he believed to be gay. According to an interview he gave in the Miami New Times, when his mother asked him what had happened he said: “This nigga did some gay shit, so I had to crack his head open.”After he left juvenile prison, he began making music, mostly underground mixtapes with minor mainstream appeal. But in 2016 Onfroy’s profile started to rise thanks to the online success of his song Look At Me!, a track with violent lyrics that set the tone for that part of his career.Onfroy was part of a new wave of artists, sometimes referred to as “soundcloud rap”, whose music embodied a disconnect with societal norms, and embraced internet culture and heavy Xanax use. The role of Xanax, an addictive and potent pharmaceutical used to treat anxiety, was important – it helped to soothe internal pain, and created a floating disconnection from reality. The other shining light of Soundcloud Rap, Lil Peep, who Onfroy mostly loathed, died in November of a Xanax overdose. At the same time as his career was beginning to flourish, Onfroy entered into a relationship with a woman who he violently abused. According to court documents he variously stomped on her head, held her head, strangled, kicked and punched her. He would also make repeated threats of suicide, often coming close to killing himself in front of her. Later, the woman became pregnant and Onfroy continued to brutally beat her and briefly kidnapped her. Onfroy was arrested for these crimes, as well as other charges and placed initially under house arrest and then in prison.While in prison Onfroy became troublingly famous. A$AP Rocky tweeted that he couldn’t wait for his release and some accused Drake of copying one of his verses. When Onfroy returned to house arrest while awaiting trial, he began recording. He worked with Diplo, among other big names and eventually released two albums, the second of which “?” went to number one. It is a powerful record, performed in large parts on acoustic guitar, by a man desperately grasping to get something out of a life which he rightly senses might already be coming to an end. He was lauded by giants of the genre including Kendrick Lamar. After his death Kayne West tweeted: “Never told you how much you inspired me when you were here thank you for existing.”Some lump Onfroy in with the #MeToo movement, and his music is discussed in thinkpieces about whether you can ever separate the art from the artist. But the truth is that Onfroy’s crimes are so unspeakably violent, his hatred for women so unchecked, that they form their own category. Unlike other artists, whose violence against women became known once they were already stars, it was Onfroy’s incarceration for domestic violence that helped create his celebrity.In his final months, Onfroy was charged with witness tampering, and was accused of pressuring his ex-girlfriend to drop the charges against him. He made some attempts to rehabilitate his image, at one point claiming to donate $100,000 to a domestic violence charity – although it’s disputed whether he actually did. But the seriousness of the crimes he was accused of never seemed to register with him, and he would often return to violent language in the same breath as trying to clear his name. Onfroy idolised Kurt Cobain, saying he was “the only person who inspires me”. Cobain is often said to be part of the “27 club” a group of people who lived hard and fast, only for their demons to catch up with them at a young age. For Onfroy 27 would have been old age, his life contained so much trauma, inflicted and endured, that he barely made it out his teens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0c74236f07ca3441b0dae09222efd3698ceccd8/0_123_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13acdc5502088e2a95b97925dd95b6ae","title":"see the positives revisit old interests how to cope with an empty nest","story":"The children have gone to university. For some parents, the void that remains is harrowing others see it as an opportunity Louise Rodgers’s two children, 25 and 24, flew the nest several years ago – but they’ve come back at various times too. “Going to university is the first part of their journey to independence, and that can go on for quite a while these days,” she says. “It’s been several years of coming and going in a really lovely, delightful way, most of the time.”Rodgers takes a dim view of empty nest syndrome. “I feel it’s a little bit of a hark back to when women defined themselves by their status as mothers and wives. And I feel that we all have more complex identities than that now – mother is just one of them.” Not everyone feels the same way. Celia Dodd, author of The Empty Nest, says that for many parents it can be a wrench when children leave for university. Even when younger siblings remain, parents can feel a sense of loss. “I’ve got three and when each one went it was very painful,” she says. “It’s a person you’re missing, not a concept. It doesn’t matter if you’ve got 14 children or one child, that’s the essence.” The process of coming to terms with an empty nest can take time, says Dodd. “The first couple of weeks are hard, and it’s good to do things to cheer yourself up. Try not to constantly ring your child but to think about things you really like doing, because you gradually find out the nice things – that you don’t have to be in two places at once, and you can go for a drink after work, and you can meet your friends.” She suggests keeping a list of enjoyable activities, such as reading a good book, or going for a swim, that you can do when you’re feeling low. You may be tempted to become involved in your child’s new life by monitoring them on social media, but Dodd’s advice is to steer clear. “I don’t think it’s helpful – you need to wean yourself off. You’ve got to get on without them and you’ve got to let them get on without you as well. They will need your support for a long time but, to some extent, you should try not to badger them.”Some parents can become “very depressed”, says Sandy Wolfson, director of programmes, postgraduate psychology, at Northumbria University, and feel as though they no longer have a sense of purpose. “It’s very important for people in that situation to see the positives – that finally you can revisit some of the interests you had years ago but put aside when you were raising your children,” she says. Rodgers agrees. A friend saw the empty nest as an opportunity to throw herself into work, leading to a “magnificent promotion”. She herself chose another route, selling the PR company she ran and retraining as a business and personal coach. “It’s not so much about filling the gap as giving space to other things that you haven’t had time to do or to think about or to experience,” she says.Wolfson suggests it’s a good time to think about returning to study yourself. That could be anything from a short local adult education class to a full degree – what better time to take a course in a subject you’ve always loved than when you finally have time to yourself?For couples, this can be an opportunity to re-evaluate a relationship. Parents are often so used to relating to each other through their children that it’s very common for marriages to break down at this stage. On the other hand, Dodd says, research shows many couple relationships improve when the children leave “because you have more quality time and you can think about each other and focus on each other”.So it’s not all doom and gloom. Ultimately, says Dodd, you form a different, more adult relationship with your grown-up children. As Rodgers says of her own experience: “What greater pleasure than to see young people mature and do what they were always supposed to do, which is flee the nest? It’s what we should be preparing for.”Last October, the youngest of Bernadette Moore’s three children, Angus, left home to study history at the University of Nottingham. When the older two, now 27 and 23, had left home, it felt hard, because they took gap years in south-east Asia, which meant long periods without contact. University was easier. “It wasn’t too bad, because I could always hop on a train and see them, and I was able to call them much more regularly.”With Angus gone, Moore finally had an empty nest and some time to herself. “I’ve worked freelance since my children were little and I have devoted my life to bringing them up,” she says. “Everyone was saying: ‘What are you going to do when Angus leaves? You are going to be bereft.’” But although she dreaded it initially, when the time arrived, she found herself ready: “It was a big wrench but I really did enjoy the freedom. I wasn’t sitting around crying.” To make sure it didn’t hit her too hard, Moore made sure she was always out of the house doing something at 4.30, the time Angus normally came home from school, and they’ve stayed in touch with weekly phone calls. She has also kept herself busy – with a part-time psychotherapy course, which she had already started by the time Angus left, and organising an art exhibition, which involved travelling from her home in London to Manchester. The empty nest finally gave her the opportunity to travel as well. “I went to visit family all over the UK, and I went to see family in France. I honestly did enjoy my new freedom, because I’d had a child in the school system for 25 years.” On reflection, she says, the anticipation “is far worse than the reality. It’s not that bad at all.” Her advice to parents contemplating an empty nest is to “have things lined up, so you can get on and do them when they’ve actually gone, rather than sitting round thinking: ‘What am I going to do now?’” Having spent anxious hours worrying that her children haven’t returned her calls, she also cautions: “Don’t worry if they don’t ring you back. No news is good news.”Moore is very grateful for the years she spent looking after her children. But she is also very positive about what comes afterwards: “I have enjoyed this new stage of my life, and once you get used to it, it’s quite liberating.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/755b322fa470cc89f247691d45028b7b668c73e7/0_0_5455_3274/master/5455.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=efddf2312a4e71d1d9147893a313f5ff 1400w","title":"boom for real jean michel basquiats mudd club gray band","story":"New documentary Boom for Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat reveals his early career, from the mob and Xerox machines to being a bad house guestJean-Michel Basquiat was a pain in the neck. In the late 1970s and 80s he was without a fixed abode and spent a lot of time sleeping on other people’s sofas. Basquiat wasn’t averse to painting his housemates’ clothes and fridge, or dropping in at 3am, pumping industrial music on his boombox, much to the consternation of the building’s “super”. “He was a kid,” laughs Sara Driver, the creator of Boom for Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat, a documentary that recounts the early life and precocious times of the NYC street kid and nascent painter.Drawing from interview and archive footage, as well as a remarkable cache of art and ephemera belonging to Basquiat’s former girlfriend Alexis Adler, it follows his life from his dropping out of high school through to the sale of his first major work and runs roughly from 1978 until 1981. “Before Reagan,” notes Driver, who recalls both the man and the period personally. “Everything changed after Reagan became president.”For all of his aforementioned domestic failings, however, the artist had many saving graces. The Basquiat in Driver’s movie comes across as a gentleman, and also a bit of a ladies’ man. “He was hitting on everybody, he was a teenager,” says Driver. “And he was a really gorgeous person, really handsome he really beamed from the inside out.”Basquiat chose to surround himself with remarkably sharp, cultured friends, including Adler, a Barnard biology graduate, as well as film-maker Jim Jarmusch, writer Luc Sante and Andy Warhol confidant Glenn O’Brien.“Everyone was about four to seven years older than him,” says Driver. “He was looking at Alexis’s science books and getting ideas for graphs and charts he was absorbing literature from Luc and film from Jim. He really picked his own professors.”While the recent Basquiat retrospective at London’s Barbican Centre exhibited the confident work of a man magnifying a turbulent period in American history, the documentary reveals that Basquiat took a while to establish himself as an artist. Indeed, he was more of a writer to begin with, penning poems on legal pads and gaining some notoriety with cryptic graffiti tagged “SAMO©” – texts, as one interviewee observes, that tended to appear in the artsy SoHo neighbourhood, perhaps because Basquiat knew whose attention he wanted to attract, even if he hadn’t settled on his métier. His noise band, Gray, were equally noteworthy, if a bit Spinal Tap at times. Fellow member Michael Holman describes building a geodesic dome for one of their performances at post-punk hangout the Mudd Club, in which the group – who included a young Vincent Gallo – were strapped into the structure’s upper reaches. Basquiat placed himself centre-stage by squeezing himself and his synthesizer into a Chinese shipping crate. “Well,” says Driver. “We were all there trying to entertain each other.”The documentary also provides great insight into the way in which improved Xerox technology spurred on both Basquiat’s early postcard collage works and late 70s punk art in general.“Artists were working in Xerox shops,” recalls Driver. “I worked in one, and so did Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth. In fact, Thurston Moore worked there for a while, too. I could work in a Xerox shop, pay the month’s rent, and still make films. You didn’t have to make that much money in order to live and eat pizza every day – it was 25 cents a slice.”Although the film focuses on the artist, it also describes a long-lost side of New York City. Lower Manhattan was rundown and lawless, but that lawlessness came at a price. The mob really did give away free heroin at the Mudd Club, in order to get its patrons hooked.“There were people that were definitely placed in the community to promote heroin use,” remembers Driver. “Then when crack was invented right around the time of Reagan, that was even more efficient at killing people.”Basquiat fatally overdosed in 1988, aged 27, although Driver ends her film much earlier, with the artist’s first successful sale to a major art-world figure: Henry Geldzahler, a former Met Museum curator who also had a hand in the early careers of David Hockney and Frank Stella. In fact, if there is one aspect of Basquiat’s life that lies oddly outside the documentary’s purview, it’s any sense of the artist’s origins and family life. Yet Driver explains that she had good reason to leave this out. “We never talked about our parents,” she says. “Nobody ever talked about their parents. We were all too busy making new tribes of our own.”Boom for Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat is in cinemas on Friday 22 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bbd40640766388ce342af7a4ae5880d9c17546/0_260_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d180055e2dd495afd57f54e510ce93ad","title":"arsenal bayer leverkusen bernd leno","story":"Arsenal have agreed a deal to sign Bernd Leno for an initial €22m (£19.2m) from Bayer Leverkusen.The 26-year-old, who was part of the Germany squad which won the Confederations Cup last year but was not selected for the World Cup, is expected to sign a five-year deal at the Emirates after he was identified as the long-term successor to Petr Cech.

The penalty, which was scored by Antoine Griezmann, helped France to a 2-1 victory.There was also controversy in England’s game against Tunisia, when Harry Kane twice appeared to be impeded but did not receive a penalty.“Last night showed major inconsistency from the referee and video referee team,” said Euro 2016 final referee Mark Clattenburg. “The referee wasn’t looking at the incident - which is normal as a lot goes on at corners - but the VAR not giving England a penalty retrospectively was a wrong call. It was a stonewall penalty. Going forward in the tournament, Fifa needs to have a think about when it is going to intervene. We’ve seen lots of good decisions but the threshold for a clear and obvious foul seems very high.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19b86d299afe9d191f917774ea50f06f91ea5ed9/51_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3bcbee5dbf867f451087e9c63e0b10b","title":"englands late world cup win sparks scenes of celebration across country","story":"Harry Kane’s 90th-minute winner set of huge celebrations last night, many captured and shared on social mediaThe drama of England’s last-gasp win in their opening World Cup match against Tunisia on Monday sparked a wave of exuberant celebrations among fans, many of which were captured and widely shared on social media. The O2 Academy in Leeds was one of many venues across the country that was not only showing the match on big screens, but was also primed to capture fan reaction from the key moments of the game. They were rewarded with footage of the absolute scenes that followed captain Harry Kane’s 90th-minute winner.In his post-match interview Kane said he hoped the win had made fans happy “in the pubs”, and multiple videos posted to social media suggested it had. Down the road from Leeds there were also wild celebrations in this bar in Sheffield.A lot of beer went up in the air in Maidstone in Kent when the goal went in.Boxpark in Croydon was the site of widely shared footage of celebrations – which included what seems an ill-judged attempt at crowd-surfing about eight seconds into the clip.Another fan who might be regretting their exuberance this morning is the person who appears to fall through a roof while celebrating – about five seconds into this one.Fans who had gathered to watch the match at the Times Square fanzone in Newcastle got to share the experience with two England veterans from the 1990 World Cup – Paul Gascoigne and Peter Beardsley spoke to the crowd before the match.London’s Tottenham Court Road was also a site of celebration after the game, with happy fans obstructing the traffic and flagging down passing cars to join in the celebrations.The celebrations in Leeds also spilled noisily out on to the street after the final whistle.The fact that the celebrations were so widespread was underlined as viewing figures for the match emerged. Presenter Gary Lineker tweeted that over 21 million people had watched the match - “18.3m peak on your televisions and more than 3m on iPlayer” -making it the most watched TV programme of the year so far, ahead of the Royal Wedding.If England keep progressing in the tournament, we can expect to see further scenes – perhaps a little more vibrant than they appear to have been when England actually won the World Cup in 1966."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cefaa03feae84eeb873c5e8d31a6a913eb800e2/0_242_7184_4311/master/7184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=901d898e644516599e569b84cc407f0f","title":"silence meets sting in tail tunisian cafe shepherds bush","story":"The crowd in Adams Cafe are experiencing mixed emotions. On the one hand, this is a small gathering of London’s Tunisian community and they are here to support the old country. On the other, it is a bunch of Londoners having a few drinks in front of the football. When England mess up, there’s words of support. When Tunisia make a mistake there’s an ironic “it’s all part of the plan!” After a while, it is not always entirely clear where allegiances lie.Established 30 years ago by Tunisian Abdel Boukra and his English wife Frances, this restaurant in Shepherd’s Bush doubles as an informal touch point for London’s Tunisian community.With only 8,000 in the UK, their numbers are small compared to Moroccans and Algerians. Abdel’s is a good place to catch up on sport, politics, and guarantee some good couscous.“I think one or two nil to England‚” says Sami Tounsi before the match. He’s lived in London for 15 years and works for the Tunisian tourist board. “We’re very fast, very quick on the break but we lack concentration. We give up chances and in the last 10 minutes we’re going to be kaput.”Sami says that the national team has come to acquire an outsized importance in Tunisia in recent years. “It’s one of the few things that unites us‚” he says.With the main dining room turned into one big table and flags of both countries hanging from the walls, the restaurant is just about full at kick-off. 10 minutes in and two teens with Jadon Sancho haircuts wearing Club Africain de Tunis shirts turn up to take the last two seats. The local MP arrives five minutes later and has to stand.The game begins in a sense of collective bemusement as England spurn a hatful of chances. This is when the split loyalties of the Tunisians become clear. Of course they want their team to win, but they know the English well enough to be able to sympathise with their travails. At one point, a particularly even-handed shout goes up: “Come on Dele Alli! Come on.... give us a break!”When Harry Kane scores his first goal, the small English contingent take it quite seriously. I ask Sami whether Tunisians take the fate of their football team as much to heart. “We are like England some times in our attitude if we get beat it’s a big deal‚” he says. “There will be an attempt to blame someone and it will usually be the coach.”Tunisia get their first corner in the 21st minute and, from there, a bit of confidence grows.“That’s good, that’s Tunisia, pass the ball‚” booms a voice at the back. Abdel, meanwhile, is larking up and down the room, wearing his Tunisia shirt but wrapped in a St George’s flag.The hitherto quiet part of the room – where the lads’ dads are sitting – explodes when Tunisia score their penalty. ‘The plan’ is definitely in effect. For the rest of the half there are ironic calls of ‘penalty’ whenever the ball comes near either box. At the interval there’s a rousing sing-along and a buffet of Tunisian tajine, pepper tapenade and deep fried calamari.Abdel and Frances met in Paris, where he was living at the time, but they are glad they settled in England. This is the experience for much of the Tunisian expat community, Abdel says. “There’s less racism in London and Manchester than on the continent,” he says. “The French-Tunisians who come to work in London’s banks would never have that chance at home.”In the second half everyone in the room cheers when Marcus Rashford comes on. The cheers are even louder when Ashley Young curls a decent free-kick opportunity over the bar. As sympathetic awwww-ing begins to go up each time England mess up another move, it gets more and more difficult to read the room. In fact it only becomes clear at the last.As Harry Kane stoops to seal the win, three quarters of the room finally falls silent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff575a2ada8ab2d02f5803702231ff601c084248/155_144_2856_1714/master/2856.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6f975c54fb6cbbe0bfbd45ee4730601","title":"world cup fiver england tunisia harry kane","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!So that’s that scuppered, then. But to hell with history! Because The Fiver retains a small sliver of hope that England may buck that trend, and end up doing rather well, after a night which saw them get away with it against Tunisia. Gareth Southgate celebrated the result by conducting a terrace chant while sporting a statement waistcoat, something not seen on prime-time BBC1 since Slade were regulars on Top of the Pops, but he soon calmed down, finished feeling the noise, and quietly reflected on his squad’s strength in depth. “The guys who came on had a different threat. The freshness of Marcus Rashford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek brought energy and a different threat to the one we’d posed. They had a good impact on the game.” A reflection you can also read as a mea culpa if you like. Because when you consider vast chunks of their performance, he’s got to pick a different starting XI next time, right?Of course, the one unequivocally good thing about the way things panned out is that Kane is now second-favourite for the Golden Boot behind Him. With two goals in the bag, and a game coming up against a Panama side so out of their depth they managed to make a Bobby M team appear coherent in attack, it’s looking good already. Could he become the first English top scorer at a World Cup since Gary Lineker in 1986? There’s a fair chance if England go deep. And Lionel Messi isn’t going to win it, is he, so the field is already thinning out. Tottenham fans might hope their man just misses out, mind you. Barcelona made off with Lineker after he top-scored in 1986, Everton powerless to resist, and they were a club used to winning stuff. Oh Spurs! Lucky their man’s just signed a new contract, eh.

And once more, Falcao does well to connect to the ball dropping over his shoulder, but can only poke it straight at Kawashima.33 min: Osako busies himself down the left. First he forces a mistake and shanks a shot across the face of the box, then he earns a corner that’s easily cleared by Colombia. After a quiet period, Japan suddenly look a bit more dangerous in attack.31 min: A tactical switch by Colombia: Barrios comes on to bolster the midfield ... and surprisingly, it’s Cuadrado who makes way.30 min: In fact, Colombia have seen more of the ball since the early drama. Though they’ve yet to create a serious chance. It’s nicely balanced.28 min: For the first time since the kick-off, there’s something of a lull. This has been a highly entertaining, open match. The ten men of Colombia have done extremely well to get properly involved.26 min: Now Colombia win a corner on the left. The ball eventually finds its way to Cuadrado on the right. He’s got time and space to shoot, yet allows himself to be closed down. His effort is blocked by the heel of Osako on the edge of the area.24 min: Haraguchi wins a corner for Japan out on the right. It’s worked back to Inui, who hooks the ball into the mixer. Yoshida, who has come up looking to cause bother, is penalised for shoving.22 min: Japan decide to take the sting out of the game, passing it slowly and calmly around the midfield, utilising their extra man. “It’s funny because the thumbnail for your Colombian national anthem YouTube video displays the line ‘el brazo que combate’, which means ‘the arm that fights’,” writes Nelson Calvinho. “Then Sanchez goes out after using his arm to fight the ball.”20 min: Izquierdo battles well in the midfield and sets Cuadrado off towards goal. He’s just about to pull the trigger on the edge of the box, when Shibasaki tracks back to make a stunning saving tackle. This is a really nice open game. Colombia have clearly decided to just go for it.18 min: Colombia seem less panicked than they were in the immediate aftermath of the penalty and sending off. They’re giving as good as they’re getting right now. Cuadrado skedaddles down the right and very nearly gets past Nagatomo, but the Japanese left-back holds firm and eventually the ball’s run out of play for a goal kick.15 min: Japan nearly take a two-goal lead. Kagawa jumps on some slack Colombian play in the midfield, and powers towards the box. He’s got Inui free, in acres, coming in from the left. Inui opens his body and tries to steer a low shot across a static Ospina and into the bottom right. But the ball bobbles wide of the post.12 min: Hasebe bundles Cuadrado to the floor. Colombia want a yellow card issued they’ll be hoping to level up the teams if at all possible. The resulting free kick, just in front of the centre circle, nearly leads to a goal: Quintero lifts the ball forward for Falcao, who sticks out a leg and tries to guide the ball into the bottom right. It would have been a picture-book goal - not totally dissimilar to Djibril Cisse’s strike in the 2006 FA Cup final - but it’s straight at Kawashima.10 min: A slightly stunned atmosphere in the Mordovia Arena, as everyone processes that early drama. The match hasn’t really got much shape as a result. Colombia are trying to get things going, though, Arias zipping down the right. But his cross is nowhere near Falcao.8 min: What a start to Colombia’s World Cup campaign! The entire move was the fault of Davinson Sanchez, who didn’t deal with a simple bouncing ball and let Osako burst clear. He’ll have a little apologising to do to his namesake Carlos, who was nevertheless correctly given his marching orders for deliberately sticking out an arm to stop Kagawa’s shot.Kagawa waits for Ospina to e to his right. Then he strokes his penalty down the middle. Cool and calm amid the mayhem. But what a start this is!5 min: It takes quite a while to shift Sanchez from the pitch. That’s about one fifth of a Rattin. But eventually he takes his leave. Kagawa prepares to take the penalty kick.3 min: Osako wriggles free of Davinson Sanchez. He’s clear down the middle! Ospina smothers his shot, but the ball rebounds to Kagawa, who smacks the ball goalwards. Carlos Sanchez sticks an arm out to save. It’s a penalty, and he’s off!2 min: Colombia hog the ball in the early exchanges. Japan are doing quite a lot of the gegenpressing. But suddenly there’s a little space for Osako down the right. He reaches the byline and whips into the centre. Ospina - who made a few mistakes during qualifying - gets an early touch and handles confidently.And we’re off! Japan get the party started on a sunny day in Saransk. But only after a false start, because the referee didn’t realise Falcao, having won the toss, wanted the teams to switch ends. The switcheroo is made, and it’s all happening!The teams are out! Colombia are in their bright yellow, Japan sport their samurai blue. We’ll be off in a minute! “The Samurai Blue strikes me as a pretty artificial and unconvincing nickname,” opines Charles Antaki. “Does a Japan fan ever say: ‘Are you going down to see the Samurai Blue play tonight?’, let alone make a tune out of it. Whereas Los Cafeteros makes perfect sense for Colombia, and they have a catchy song in the cumbia style.”The national anthems. Colombia’s effort is transmitted, by law, at 6pm every night on TV. Push through that sort of legislation in the UK, and half the country would top themselves by the time The One Show comes round. But the Himno Nacional de la República de Colombia is much jauntier than God Save..., so they can get away with that sort of edict. ♭♮♯ In agony, the Virgin tears out her hair  And bereft of her love leaves it to hang on a cypress  Regretting her hope is covered by a cold headstone  But glorious pride hallows her fair skin ♭♮♯Japan’s, meanwhile, is a no-messing masterpiece.

For what it’s worth, here’s today’s scrawl. We mean well.Pre-match playtime. It’s the pub argument we’re all having: who would you select in your all-time Japan team? Our snazzy tool can help you decide, once and for all! I’m afraid there isn’t a similar gizmo for Colombia, but I don’t make the rules, and in any case we all dream of a team of 11 René Higuitas, so we’d be wasting our time anyway.Early team news: There’s to be no James Rodriguez in Colombia’s starting XI. He’s suffering from muscle fatigue, so it’s up to all-time leading scorer Radamel Falcao to lead the Cafeteros charge. Japan go with experience, too: former Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa and erstwhile Inter defender Yuto Nagatomo are in their starting line-up.Some welcome news for long-suffering readers: You don’t have to put up with my nonsense for the next couple of hours. That’s because Ben Mabley is MBMing this game too! So you can chip off there if you prefer. One minor caveat: he’s doing it in Japanese. That may limit your options, to be fair. You’re stuck with me, then. Sorry.We’ve waited a long time for Group H to come around. Nearly a week! But we’ve waited even longer to see Radamel Falcao at a World Cup. The Monaco man was injured when Colombia made it to the quarter-finals last time round, forced to sit and watch James Rodriguez steal the show in Brazil. But now he’s back! Can he dovetail with Rodriguez and set his country off on another World Cup adventure? We’re about to find out ... if Rodriguez passes a late fitness test, that is.The Colombians are favourites for this one. Their form hasn’t been particularly special - a win in France, but then two goalless draws against Australia and Egypt - though it’s been better than Japan’s. The Samurai Blue recently beat Paraguay, it’s true, but that result merely put an end to a run of three defeats on the spin, against Ukraine, Ghana and Switzerland. Colombia also have the sign over their opponents: they’re unbeaten in their previous three matches against Japan, the most recent being a 4-1 whipping at the last World Cup.Here’s to a good game, anyway. Colombia usually entertain at World Cups, Japan are better when they go forward, and none of Colombia’s 18 matches at the World Cup have ended 0-0. Fingers crossed that run continues. It’s on!Kick off: 1pm BST, 3pm at the Mordovia Arena, Saransk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc19936347eed5e8bbebd5ab174d5db5846a7e00/0_127_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33dd9c911b820ab5b603c4b5c5fe68fb","title":"world cup 2018 day six tunisia england reaction russia back in action live","story":"Right, that’s just about it for today, as we transfer our gaze to yer actual football matches.

Meanwhile, here’s a bit of pre-match reading for you before Colombia v Japan gets underway – Stuart James on the long-awaited World Cup finals debut of Radamel Falcao:Watching Sky Sports scrabble around for footage during a major tournament is always a joy, a biennial turning of the tables if you will: they’re about to treat us to some long-distance shots of England’s training session, to supplement a morning of world exclusives showing us that people in pubs supporting football teams celebrate when their team scores.The Colombia v Japan minute-by-minute is now go, in both English and Japanese:Anyway, enough VAR talk: today’s three matches all look tough to predict. Colombia should have too much for Japan but Group H feels the hardest to call overall, with Poland, Senegal and Colombia all fancying their chances of topping the group. Will the fact that no African side have taken a point yet burden a talented Senegal this afternoon? And in normal circumstances you’d fancy an Egypt side with a fit and firing Mo Salah to beat Russia but the opening round threw some of those assumptions up in the air.England fitness news: Dele Alli is to have a scan on his thigh injury today and won’t take part in the training session due to start shortly. I was surprised he stayed on as long as he did last night – he didn’t look at his game at all after half-time.There wasn’t really a break in play for Sweden’s penalty yesterday either, but the referee did eventually halt play for that.Away from the World Cup, the juggernaut that is the Champions League will always be with us.

Ties will be played just after the World Cup semis and final respectively, on July 10-11 and 17-18.Looking at the VAR thing, could some lessons not be learnt from cricket + tennis? there could be a Review option where each team can formally ask to have (3) incidents reviewed if they disagree with the initial decision (or lack thereof...). This might ensure that there is a formal way for teams to shed light on wrestling in the box etc. If the reviews are upheld, they keep them. If they are wrong then they lose one....like tennis as well. I don’t think this would be too complicated and could be restricted to incidents in the box only.David Squires’s latest cartoon is with us. Ronaldo’s relationship with the taxman, Patrice Evra’s punditry and Neymar’s barnet all get the treatment:Thanks Ben. Morningafternoon everyone. James Felix clearly has a different Twitter timeline from mine – saw plenty of complaining about refereeing during last night’s match. I suspect there might have been a different emphasis had Kane not popped up at the back stick just in the nick of time. Talking of grievances over officiating, the Brazilian Football Confederation has asked Fifa why VAR was not used to review Switzerland’s equaliser against the tournament favourites on Sunday, and also complained that Gabriel Jesus was manhandled inside the penalty area and should have been awarded a penalty. “The CBF requires to know from Fifa the reason the technology was not used in key incidents during the game,” the Brazilian confederation said in a statement. Fair? “There’s been far too little moaning about the refereeing last night, by far the worst in the tournament so far,” emails James Felix. “Not only did the ref not have any authority over the game, none of the team seemed to be officiating the game on the same rules as the other games. There has been a practice of not giving tight attacking offsides until after play has developed to allow for VAR, but in this game the linesmen were far too keen to raise their flag and were often wrong. Also they seemingly ignored the directive on cutting down on ‘wrestling’ in the box.”My colleague, Tom Davies, will continue to guide you though the all going-ons ... Russia play their second match of the tournament tonight, in St Petersburg. They crushed Saudi Arabia 5-0 in their opener, but will surely not repeat that feat against Egypt this evening? Artem Dzyuba, who plays his club football in the city for Zenit, knows they have already silenced a few critics. “I can’t say they were the majority but, yes, there were people who didn’t believe in us,” he says. “Knowing that the whole country is cheering for us is an indescribable feeling.”Could Poland prove dark horses in Russia? Any one of Senegal, Colombia, Japan and Adam Nawalka’s side will fancy themselves in what looks a fairly open Group H. Key to their hopes: Robert Lewandowski, of course, and Piotr Zielinski:Keep your emails, tweets and thoughts below the line coming. “I can’t agree with Andrew Benton’s comments,” says Martin Gamage. “I didn’t think it looked like the old England at all. There was far more verve in the performance – at least initially – and when that burst of energy petered out, they stuck to their plan and style of play. Previous England teams would – I think – have panicked and started firing hopeful balls into the box, but this one kept plugging away in tricky circumstances and found a way to win. In fact, I had no doubt that they would win from half-time onwards, it just took a bit longer than was comfortable.”The view from the Adams Cafe, a slice of the huge peak audience (18.3m) who watched the game unfold on BBC One last night:Senegal’s head coach, Aliou Cissé, once of Birmingham City and Portsmouth, has been talking up the African nations before his side’s Group H opener against Poland. I am certain that one day an African country will win the World Cup. It was some 25 years ago that African countries regularly came just to be a part of the World Cup. I think that things have developed but it’s more complicated in our continent – we have realities that are not evident in other continents. We trust our football, we have no complex, we have great players, now we need African coaches for our football to go ahead.England’s back three looked pretty slick at times last night. As of Wednesday, one defender who just missed out on making the cut, James Tarkowski, will be planning for a European tour of a different kind with Burnley. Sean Dyche’s side are among those in the Europa League second qualifying round draw. “It’s another opportunity for us to show what we can do on a bigger stage,” says Tarkowski, who was forced to withdraw from Gareth Southgates’s five-man standby list after undergoing hernia surgery last month.What’s on the menu today?And here’s a couple of sumptuous previews to whet the appetite:Did Harry Kane’s winner paper over the cracks a little or was it a just reward after hundreds of chances? “I’m worried that the young England is exactly like the old England except younger,” emails Andrew Benton. “The bulldog style of pressuring the opponents is still there, with goals at set-pieces, but then so is the falling to bits a bit when that doesn’t work. Is the team, as a team, building its intelligence and flexibility in play on the field? Time will tell.”Transfer nugget: in the latest twist of this summer’s protracted saga, Nabil Fekir has given a teeny update of sorts in the France press conference this morning, the day after his agent insisted “the story isn’t over” when quizzed over his client’s failed move to Liverpool. “It was great to see Jean-Michel Aulas (the Lyon president) yesterday but we did not at all discuss my situation,” Fekir says. “I am here with France, I am happy, and I am not here to discuss my personal situation. We will see about all that later. My knee is super-good. We work a lot on it, we reinforce it.”Reasons to be cheerful, courtesy of not Ian Dury but the England manager, who waxes lyrical, sort of, about strength in depth:Poland are in action against Senegal in Group H a little later, but that hasn’t stopped their go-to striker being touted for a transfer:Before getting bogged down in what’s coming up on day six, let’s indulge in England’s first win in the opening game at a World Cup since 2006 just that little longer. That team featuring Beckham, Gerrard, Lampard, Rooney and co 12 years ago was, on paper – as they say on Love Island – ludicrously easy to get excited about but it would be naive to put a ceiling on the class of 2018, wouldn’t it?Without doubt, one of the sweetest sights last night was surely the television cameras picking up Gareth Southgate’s instinctive words as the ball ran free after a superb stop by Mouez Hassen, the Tunisia goalkeeper, to deny John Stones. “Oh, where’s Harry?”Saudi Arabia could probably do with a helping hand of sorts – and not their plane catching fire en route to Rostov. After crashing to a 5-0 opening defeat against Russia, they meet Uruguay on Wednesday:Once the dust, and midges, had finally settled in Volgograd, there was another result to be had between a few of the usual, and more unusual suspects. On Twitter, there was Gary Lineker v Piers Morgan, part XXXIII, and Alan Shearer v ... Simon Schama. Lineker and Morgan exchanged the usual barbs, but the former probably came out on top in that Group I opener, labelling Morgan a “hacker”. Not in Russia, but soon to be at Arsenal. The 26-year-old goalkeeper was left out of Germany’s 23-man squad for the tournament:It’s coming home, isn’t it? England beat Tunisia in the best manner possible, especially if you were one of the many thousands bobbing up and down, limbs haywire in front of a big screen at the pub, a projector or at a mini fan-zone. From Leeds to Bristol and beyond, Harry Kane’s winner was priceless, for three points, for the rest of this week and perhaps the rest of the tournament in Russia.  If it had been 1‑1 there would have been a level of disappointment, and the result back home would be viewed differently, but the performance was very good. Maybe you run out of time, but we kept doing the right things and making good decisions. We had leaders on the field who kept delivering the right messages. We spoke this morning and covered being behind and in front in games, how we’d react being 1-1 with 15 minutes to go, and we had to keep probing and look for the win while not exposing ourselves on the counter … and good teams score late.It’s time for me to handover to my colleague Ben Fisher and ride off in to the antipodean sunset. Thanks for your company and apologies to those whose emailstweets etc I couldn’t include. Enjoy day six - to think we’ll soon be 1764 games down and Russia 2018 will be very much well on its way it’s happening too fast!And speaking of physicality, some interesting comments out of the Australian camp ahead of their do-or-die second group match against Denmark, here’s Reuters:The Socceroos believe Denmark is a mirror-image of themselves in terms of game style: physical, pragmatic, team-orientated.“They are quite similar to ourselves in the way they set up and the way they go about things,” Australia defender Trent Sainsbury said.“So it will be interesting to come up against a mirror.” The contrast presumably being that the artisans of France were more cultured than their pragmatic first-round opponents. No pressure on teammate Tom Rogic but, he’s just been liked to Christian Eriksen.An interesting side note that came out of yesterday’s Sweden v South Korea result was the confession from manager Shin Tae-yong that his side were “psychologically” intimidated by the larger Swedish team.It’s a phenomenon Australian sides have certainly looked to exploit in AFC qualifications against East Asian nations, with Australia’s historic first-ever World Cup win coming against a Japanese side in 2006 that was subjected to a barrage of high balls as the then-Oceania representatives chased a late winner.With Japan in action against Colombia today you wouldn’t imagine such an issue will arise, but perhaps for their second round match against Senegal, physicality could become a factor (especially if both sides are left winless after the opening round).Anyone who watched Mexico v Germany however would assert that giving away a significant height disadvantage means nothing if the heart is willing so has South Korea rolled out the white flag already on this front?Incidentally, no pressure on Poland - but thus far at Russia 2018 every single team from Europe remains undefeated, except for, oh, the defending champions Germany. It’s a remarkable start for Uefa in the battle of the confederations - can the Poles make it 1314 today?Conversely, Senegal will be battling for pan-African pride, with all four African nations losing their opening matches, which doesn’t bode well for them, if you’re particularly superstitious.Iran flies the flag for Asia, having won their opening match. A relief for the world’s most populous region after it’s four representatives at Brazil 2014 won 012 of their group stage matches. Japan will look to match that result you’d imagine for East-Asian pride.And but for Mexico’s upset result it would have been no wins from Concacaf, while Uruguay provide Conmebol’s solitary opening round win, an achievement Colombia will look to match today as well.And to continue our tactical previews of Group H’s second match, and the final ‘first look’ at sides at the World Cup.Meanwhile, to humour our good friends waking up across England this morning, we promise we won’t over-hype the opening Three Lions’ result only to establish the perfect terrain for the inevitable come down. But for even the most cynically hearted you can’t deny this is a nice sight:Let’s turn our attention to the first of today’s three matches, Colombia v Japan, where if your knowledge of these two is a bit rusty, rest assured we have terrific squad previews courtesy the  experts’ network.Returning to VAR and it’s first week assessment:Our below the line commenter ‘USfan’ has the following contribution.I’m pleased we are talking about VAR. The alternative was talking about all the games ruined by the lack of VAR, which is what we usually do.France-Australia was put right by VAR. VAR was key to protecting the integrity of Peru-Denmark (even if Peru didn’t convert their penalty, it would have been massively unfair to Peru had it not been given, and their fans would understandably have felt robbed). It’s even good they reviewed incidents like Costa’s goal against Portugal.Seems a pretty reasonable take. Although if it was anyone else in world football apart from Pepe perhaps Costa’s contact might have warranted a different outcome.Snap poll, then - would you rather argue about a subjective interpretation from the seemingly objective VAR or the injustice of a simple error from a human referee?I for one would never wish to have not experienced the sheer splendid drama of Graham Poll v Jo Simunic at Germany 2006, which no doubt the humourless VARs would have nipped in the bud.By the end of the day we will also have got our first look at all the candidates for the Golden Boot race.611 of our  writers tipped Neymar or Gabriel Jesus to win pre-tournament, but are you ready to write off either Brazilian after their showings against Switzerland?Cristiano Ronaldo may not have featured too prominently in many people’s reckoning given Portugal’s relative standing vis-a-vis the big favourites, but has the five-time Ballon D’Or winner already laid down a significant marker with the 51st hattrick of his career against what is on paper Portugal’s toughest Group B opponent?His former national team coach, and club coach with Manchester United, Carlos Quieroz may be hoping not, as he looks to build from his side Iran’s opening win against Morocco.Another significant talking point that was always going to rear its head, given its World Cup debut in Russia, is the introduction of video assistant referees or VAR.Designed to correct the more egregious examples of human error, is the system in its current format not just equally as subjective, given it’s hazy brief of correcting “clear and obvious errors”?So almost a full round of matches in - what are your thoughts on video technology? Presumably this aligns a lot with how your team has fared thus far, as I don’t imagine South Korean or Australian fans will be knocking down my door with fervent praise for our new robot overlords.Sean Ingles draws an interesting parallel to the introduction of new rulings surrounding the backpass in the Premier League ahead of the 1992-93 season. Do you agree with him?As we approach the conclusion of the opening round of group stage matches today it is perhaps the headline talking point - the somewhat underwhelming first showings of the so-called ‘favourites’.Plenty of champion sides have built slowly into major tournaments - but is there any grounds to press the panic button for fans of Germany, or even Brazil, Argentina or Spain?The German press were certainly less than enthused with what they saw against Mexico:With Barney Ronay’s in-stadium assessment damning of Germany’s most un-German of characteristics, appearing disorganised.Indeed, with three of the last four tournament champions suffering the indignity of losing their opening game it prompts the question of whether basic psychology has cracked that most resolute of barriers, die Mannschaft.Was Thomas Müller, Mesut Őzil, Mats Hummels and friends, dare it be said overconfident or even arrogant going into this one? Joachim Löw’s fashion certainly was.One thing’s for sure, it makes for a fascinating resolution of matches in Group F, where on too many occasions in recent years we’ve seen favourites coast through near dead rubbers in game three.Now much has already been discussed regarding England’s win this morning, with a bunch of solid talking points emerging from the match, as Dominic Fifield has expertly surmised:But as Peruvian fans (or dare we also suggest Australian fans?) will attest its a game of the finest margins, football, so can you ever really put your finger on which particular “one per center” gets a side across the line?Germany’s travelling cohort certainly had grounds to be aggrieved, with effort’s like Julian Brandt’s late rocket or Toni Kroos’ freekick so agonising close to drawing parity.But consider the following:and now this:Tell me that’s not a crucial “one per center”.And while Real Madrid has been busy trying to scupper its nation’s World Cup chances crosstown rivals Atlético have been going about their business with less ructions: announcing the signing and re-signing of three of France’s stars.Star striker Antoine Griezmann and defender Lucas Hernández have signed the dotted line for extended stays, but it’s the signing of promising Monaco winger Thomas Lemar that has tongue’s wagging. €60m (£52.7m) is the mentioned price. I wonder how many cut-price Nikola Kalinić’s you can get for that.So let’s wrap up some news the big talking point from late yesterday was of course Croatia’s Nikola Kalinić getting sent home for apparently refusing to play in their World Cup match against Nigeria. You wonder how that goes down with professional footballers around the world. I’m sure a plane ride shared with somebody like Ryan Giggs might remind him how special an opportunity representing your country on the biggest stage of all is.And speaking of plane rides, a positive outcome for a team beset by a very unwelcome distraction, with Saudi Arabia’s players all safe and sound after their plane caught fire, en route to Rostov-on-Don.And you thought their opening fixture against Russia was harrowing.Finally, some positive news for those that recall the shocking scenes from Marseilles during Euro 2016, with English fans in Volgograd reporting “fantastic” hospitality and a trouble-free experience.In fairness it was a deserved result for Three Lions, as Harry Kane said so himself, who have already done better than defending champions Germany, and favourites Brazil, Spain and Argentina in navigating their opening Group G encounter.But to today’s three games! On day six we’ll see the conclusion of the first round of group stage clashes, and as always we’ll have live blogs, match reports and special features in abundance to keep you across all the action.He was the subject of will-he, won’t-he speculation following his champions league final injury that saw him fail to appear in their opening match, but Mohammed Salah has confirmed he’s ready for Egypt’s crunch game against the host nation.Before then though we’ll get our first look at Group H. How will Colombia’s forgotten man, Radamel Falcao, fare after the agony of missing Brazil 2014, against Japan’s Samurai Blue? Another man seeking redemption is Poland’s goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, after harrowing showings at Euro 2012 and 2016 he takes on a Senegalese side whose coach Aliou Cissé hopes can recreate the memorable team of 2002, of which he was a integral part.Three terrific features there from Stuart James, David Hytner and Ed Aarons to sink your teeth into to start the day. Meanwhile, here’s the match schedule:I’m here for the next few hours alongside the early birds of UK and Western Europe and the night owls of North \u0026amp South America to help you get up to speed. As always feel free to join the conversation via email (richard.parkin.casual@the), twitter (@rrjparkin) or simply comment below the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54b0aa823e878d514ebaf4feae8e24cebba92f37/119_1185_860_516/master/860.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8415702cc963456ed2cc79033e6342b9","title":"image sobbing toddler us border it was hard for me to photograph john moore","story":"The photographer behind the viral image that exposed the anguish of Trump’s controversial border policy speaks outPhotographer John Moore, whose viral image of a weeping two-year-old girl at the US border has become the potent symbol of the outrage over Donald Trump’s controversial “zero tolerance” policy, including family separations, knew what he had captured was “important”.What he could not guess, however, was how great an impact his picture would have on the debate as it was published around the globe.Moore, a veteran Getty Images photographer, who has spent a decade documenting immigration and US border issues, had been accompanying a patrol along the Rio Grande Valley.Over the years, Moore had become familiar with both the routes over this border and the way different people reacted: how those who crossed inidually, usually men, would run and try to hide from the border patrols. Many families, tired from their often weeks-long journey, would seek to surrender almost immediately to the officers whom they encountered.Night had fallen and Moore was waiting in the scrub by the riverside for rafts carrying undocumented migrants, when the sound of four boats and a dozen people became audible. Those crossing were arrested almost immediately by border officers.And unlike those in the boat, Moore knew what was likely to happen.“I have photographed many immigrant families seeking political asylum at the border over the last few years. “I am sure that most of these families had no idea of the new US policy to separate children from their parents during the immigration court proceedings. “I knew, however, what would happen to many of them next – separation – after they were taken away, so it was difficult for me to witness.Each of the adults was frisked before being loaded into a van to take them to a processing centre, he said.“One of the last in line was the mother with her daughter. I had spoken with her briefly and she said she was from Honduras and that she and her two-year-old had been traveling for a month to reach the US border. “The officer asked her to put the little girl on the ground while the mother was searched. Once on the ground the young girl immediately started crying. “As a photojournalist covering this story for years, and as the father of three children, including a toddler, it was personally very hard for me to photograph. Very quickly the two were then bundled into the transport van, and it was over. I had to take a few deep breaths, as it was emotional for me to see.”In the context of the debate that has convulsed US politics since the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border has been thrust into the spotlight – attracting criticism even from high profile Republicans and former first lady Laura Bush – Moore knew what he was seeing would have resonance.“I knew that this image was important. There was no way for me to know just how much so,” he said, in the midst of back-to-back interviews with US networks and other media outlets.“For me, it’s both gratifying to make photographs that matter, and saddening to witness. As a photojournalist who has worked in difficult disaster and conflict zones for many years, that conflict of emotion never really goes away.“I have always tried to humanise this broad and complex story that is often told with statistics. So, with the photos of the young girl and her mother, I hope I achieved that to some extent. People remember the photos that make them feel.”He added: “Photojournalists and reporters alike, we all want to make a difference with the work that we do. Some images have a unique power to break through the collective dissonance. Much of the time, however, even when we do our very best, our work often has limited impact on government policies. This image has energised the American public on the issue of the separation of families and touched many people emotionally. I hope it helps to change policy.”For now, however, Moore would like to know what has happened to the little girl and her mother. “US Customs and Border Protection have not been forthcoming on their status so far. I would love to know where they are and how they are doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089bc2ae29717f919a0e29a90576ca161e1af7cd/0_334_3877_2326/master/3877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b3a1165fc8a6b68a9e2ac5de609c899","title":"from overnight oats to boiled eggs is meal prep taking the joy out of eating","story":"Loved by fitness fanatics, the thrifty and eco-warriors, there are now 8m posts of pre-prepared meals on Instagram, arrayed in rows of colourful Tupperware. But is it good for you?The relationship between food and social media was once straightforward. Those were the innocent days when no meal could be declared consumed unless it had also been photographed, filtered and posted on Instagram, when the world seemed merely a stage for avocado toast, açai bowls and barista art. It was a different time – a time before meal prep.While meal prep has long existed, of course, it has grown in popularity over the past six years, aided by Instagram, where there are 8m posts with the hashtag #mealprep. Most show a variety of meals prepared for the week ahead – quinoa salads, chicken rice bowls, carrot sticks, broccoli florets, hulled strawberries – all displayed in a selection of artfully photographed Tupperware-style containers.Behind the glamour of such posts, meal prep is a simple concept: set aside a day of the week to prepare the bare bones of your meals for the following week, then store it in containers in your freezer or refrigerator until its allotted day. The theory is that it saves time in the busy midweek when the idea of cooking from scratch feels draining. It also saves money by encouraging home cooking and reduces food and packaging waste. It is favoured by those who wish to control portion size and calorie consumption and those following, say, a high-protein diet. In short, it is beloved by fitness fanatics, the financially thrifty, the environmentally minded, the nutritionally conscious and, of course, wellness bloggers.King came across meal prep six years ago, before he worked in fitness, while taking part in a shoot for Men’s Health magazine. “I was working with a trainer and meal prep has been a long-running thing with people who train,” he says. “He told me about prepping chicken, protein shakes, boiled eggs. It was so boring and bland, but it was the first time I did it and it was like: ‘Wow, it really is important to know these things if you want to be goal-specific.’ Diet is absolutely key when it comes to the whole shebang of keeping fit and meal prep makes it one more thing not to worry about.”These days, King goes “in and out” of meal prep. He has a base level of fitness and a breadth of nutritional knowledge that allows him to be a little more relaxed. But when he has a particular need to be at his physical peak he returns to a meal-prepping regime. “I’ve got a photoshoot in about three weeks’ time for my online coaching service, so in about a week, when I get back from Ibiza, I’ll be getting my containers out,” he says. “I’ll have two weeks of being very disciplined. I hate the word diet, but I batten down the hatches and focus on fueling my body the best way I can.”For King, and most meal preppers, work begins at the weekend. “I always recommend to clients that Sunday is a great day to get organised for the week ahead,” he says. “It stimulates the brain. You can spend an afternoon on the sofa refreshing your phone or going down the pub, but what about going to the market, the fishmonger, the butcher, planning your week, working within a budget, thinking about packaging?”He has a few tricks: “How you can make 30 mini omelettes in a mini-muffin tray, how you can cook eggs in bulk in an oven, how roughly two skewers would be enough protein for a meal, how blanching broccoli means it won’t go soggy after a couple of days,” he says. “You can be efficient and productive about it, but you can also make an afternoon out of it – work with your partner, put some music on.” The containers are essential. “There are many different sizes, with different compartments, which helps portion control,” King explains. “So you can weigh out X grams of meat or veg or salad.”Showing off our food is nothing new – think of the Victoria sponges, raspberry jams and prize onions of a village fete, of buffet spreads and the relentless peacocking of dinner parties. “We always have a Martha Stewart impulse in a society – we want to make something and we want to show everyone we made it and it looks great,” Elias says. “People will do that for ever and always have. But Instagram adds another level.”This is the strange puzzle of meal prep. On the one hand, it appears another symptom of an ostentatious, aesthetically preoccupied age, in which one cannot simply eat healthily, but must do so in a way that is meticulously curated and visually pleasing and then posted about on the internet. On the other, there is something so curiously old-fashioned here – a return to the culture of the weekly shop, the rhythm of meal planning and home cooking – that it is hard not to view it as a reaction to the age of instant gratification, a rejection of the world in which every kind of cuisine is available to us at any hour of the day.It is striking how many men have embraced the trend. “It’s part of a larger shift in masculinity and part of the de-industrialisation of society,” says Elias. “Manliness is uncoupled from manual labour. And, since the 80s, cooking has been a thing that both men and women can be impressed by. So, men are now cooking. But, of course, they take it over and it becomes competitive.” For those who can find neither time nor inclination to spend their Sundays slaving over a hot mini-muffin tray, there is the promise of a meal-prep delivery service, where all the chopping, dicing, measuring and boxing has been done for you.The biggest of these is HelloFresh, which launched in the UK six and a half years ago and now has 1.9 million customers worldwide. Co-founder Patrick Drake says the company ascertained that it was “all the stuff before cooking” that put off people who felt they could not cook or did not like cooking. “It was the meal planning, the trudging to the supermarket, the buying ingredients in bulk that never get used up,” says Drake. What meal-prep delivery gave them, he argues, “was a feeling of achievement” untouched by ready meals or takeaway. “The slightly intangible thing is that little moment of victory when they stand back and say: ‘I made that!’ It’s a satisfying thing to take raw ingredients and turn them into a beautiful meal.”For all its peculiarities and showiness, #mealprep might serve as “a bridge for people who didn’t grow up cooking”, says Elias. King agrees: “If you’ve fallen out of touch with how food is made, meal prep can help you find it again.”Even those who have made a career exploring the sensuous pleasures of food are not necessarily horrified by the trend. “It’s sort of Lego cooking, isn’t it?” says the food writer and Great British Menu judge Matthew Fort. “But anything that encourages people to cook meals from scratch must be a good thing. It’s also a useful way, if that’s your bent of mind, to control how much you eat and your calorie intake – though I personally find that rather depressing.”King encourages prospective meal preppers to ignore the pressures of social media hashtags. “Don’t be one of these Instagram-happy people with their overnight oats,” he laughs. “Not everyone has the time, money and energy to do it like that. I think food is something that should be enjoyed it’s important not to get bogged down by it.”Some degree of meal prep can, however, play a role in regaining a heathy relationship with eating. “It’s common for those with eating disorders as part of their recovery to have input from a dietician or a trained professional and to have meal plans as part of quite a structured approach,” Quinn says. “For people with eating disorders, there can be some anxiety around spontaneous approaches to eating – for example, going to a restaurant where you don’t know the menu. So, some structured plan over a week, where you know this is what you are going to be eating and these are the ingredients, can be helpful. But this is only done with support and guidance with a trained professional. We would never recommend just going on to Instagram and seeing what someone else’s meal plan is.”I traipse through the internet in search of meal prep ideas: pretty mason jars filled with layers of fruit and granola, black rice sushi rolls, sweet potato chunks held in airtight plastic containers in shades of sapphire and frosted crystal. It is a world that seems potentially bright and crisp and exciting.At some point, I follow a link to a story about a woman in Australia who preps a month’s worth of family breakfasts and lunches in just four hours for approximately $60 (£34), but when I look at the pictures I feel crestfallen by their beigeness: puff pastry pinwheels, cheese sandwiches, containers of macaroni cheese. This, I suspect, is the more prosaic reality of meal prep.I think of something Fort said when we discussed the trend’s potential drawbacks. “The only major criticism is that it removes the instinctive and creative part of cooking,” he says. “What seems a brilliant idea when you plan on a Sunday night might seem rather less desirable when you get to a damp, cold, wet Thursday. For me, part of the pleasure of cooking is the instinctive response to ingredients, of looking at something and thinking: ‘Ah! What shall I do with that?’ And so, for me, it might be a little sterile. Because the idea of eating for pleasure, for joy, for happiness, a sense of community, seems a pity to lose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c7d9cf42ea9d687bf9037355f0250612dbd661e/46_0_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d830a98e953292b8d58efb7bbd9cc778","title":"multiple orgasm clitoris science research","story":"On-screen depictions of sex show women coming again and again, yet in reality many women never climax during sex. Here’s what we know so far about the clitoris and G-spotI’ll set the scene. There will be a man and a woman and they are having sex. Up against a wall, in a bed, in a car, anywhere. Vertically, horizontally. Clothed or unclothed. None of that matters, because the outcome will be the same. Within a minute, usually, the man and woman will have an orgasm at the same time. It will be visible, spectacular, satisfying. Then perhaps, she will have another and another and another.This scene will be familiar because it has been enacted ever since sex was allowed onscreen. But it is fiction. Not because women can’t have multiple orgasms. But if they do, it is unlikely to be because of thrusting. That’s if they get an orgasm in the first place.The orgasm. “A feeling of intense sexual pleasure that happens during sexual activity,” according to the NHS. That much is known. But e any deeper into the science of women’s genitalia, and how they work, and there will be surprises. We’re still in a black hole of not knowing very much about the sexual health and mechanisms of half the population. A few things that scientists and academics are still fiercely debating: how a female orgasm is triggered, what it does and what it’s for. Things are better than they were in the 19th century, when male gynaecologists examined women while standing behind a cloak. But in the late 1970s, medical men were still having earnest discussions in the pages of medical journals about whether menstruating women emitted a poisonous substance called menotoxin, that made flowers wilt. The US National Institutes of Health only set up a programme to research vaginal health in 1992 – the male orgasm was first researched a century earlier.After climax, or resolution, the man enters a “refractory period,” where he has to recover. This varies from a few minutes in young men to 20 hours in older ones, but however long it is, there will be no response to sexual stimulation. A woman has no such barrier. If she has had an orgasm, and not faked it, she may “plateau”, but within seconds or minutes, or when she feels like it, given the right stimulation – probably (but not only) clitoral – she can feasibly orgasm again. The circumstances required include her environment, her partner (if she needs one), and her knowledge of her own body. It’s surprising, says Professor Linda Cardozo, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, “how many women don’t even know what their genitalia are called”. We say vagina (the internal passage leading to the cervix) when it’s the vulva (external genitalia). We see images of women with improbably shaven genitalia, and supposedly female dolls with no external labia. The authors of one study that attempted to understand how women’s genitalia varied in appearance marvelled that “even some recent textbooks of anatomy do not include the clitoris on diagrams of the female pelvis”. When women come to her thinking they are dysfunctional in some way, says Sarah Martin, executive director of the World Association of Sex Coaches, one of the most powerful things she can do is send them away to look at their vulva in a mirror. Using the right words is important too. Vulva, not vagina. Otherwise, says Vincenzo Puppo, a sexologist at the University of Florence, women think of their vagina as “just a hole”.Martin also tries to get women to relax. Before orgasm, alpha waves in our brains slow down. A recent documentary on the “super-orgasm” – actually multiple orgasms – found that women who had multiple orgasms had slower alpha waves than the average woman. Their brains were quieter, making more room for pleasure. “The thing about sex of all sorts,” says Martin, “is that sex takes place in the body. It’s very hard to think about pleasure if you are worrying instead of focusing on your body.”You may think differently about the vagina if you believe in the G-spot. Puppo has little patience with it, and labels anatomical illustrations with: “the invented zone for the G-spot”. It is named after Ernest Gräfenberg, who wrote a paper in 1950 about an erogenous zone on the vaginal anterior wall. This was launched into popular perception by an eponymous 1981 book written by two psychologists and a nurse, and by countless articles since. The nurse was Beverley Whipple, who told the Science Vs podcast that her team had investigated by inserting fingers into women’s vaginas and feeling around the clock. “Between 11o’clock and 1 o’clock,” Whipple says, “we got a lot of smiles.”What a great thought. Except Gräfenberg never wrote about a G-spot. He did write about women he called “frigid,” and reported that some women were stimulated by inserting hat pins. There is still no good scientific data to prove its existence, although plenty of women believe they have one. “The G-spot,” wrote the neuroscientist Terence Hines in 2001, “will remain a sort of gynaecologic UFO, much searched for and discussed, but unverified by objective means.” The debate matters, says Puppo, because “women who fail to ‘find’ their G-spot, because they fail to respond to stimulation as the G-spot myth suggests that they should, may end up feeling inadequate or abnormal”.Cardozo is circumspect. “There is some doubt as to whether a particular spot in the anterior vaginal wall is relevant in terms of orgasm. When women have had that part of the anterior wall excised, they have still been able to orgasm.”The G-spot debate hasn’t prevented cosmeto-gynaecologists from offering procedures such a G-spot amplification, a concept first offered by the Californian gynaecologist David Matlock, who decided injecting collagen into the vaginal wall would enhance sensation for four months and the chance of single or multiple vaginal orgasms. The American College of Obstetricians disagreed, deciding that the procedure had no scientific basis, and anyway, Cardozo says, “the herd of cows that provided the collagen died out”. Now the money-maker is the O-shot (O for orgasm), an injection into the vaginal wall of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derived from the woman’s blood.“There is no scientific data on this,” says Cardozo, with some finality, although PRP has worked in dental patients, allegedly enhancing the healing process. You probably want tips for how to get a multiple orgasm here. Or even a single one. I prescribe better research, of course. But also, better talking. Communication is as powerful as lube, whether it’s with a partner or a doctor. For women who think they need to surgically alter their vulva because they are abnormal, the American College of Obstetricians prescribes “a frank discussion” about the wide range of normal genitalia.The clitoris should be placed on equal standing with the penis. All these prescriptions can combine for as pleasing an outcome as an orgasm, single or multiple. Because it matters. The female orgasm may have a reproductive role or not: I’ll leave that up to scientists to debate, and celebrate the fact that they are debating it. Perhaps it’s enough to know that an orgasm feels good, and in these dark times you deserve it, or many."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03da6c1a4ac1c84f975513412ac4da527948c771/211_1920_4405_2642/master/4405.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f41f8864875f9886f5d8043907106041","title":"nigel slaters courgettes tagliatelle recipe","story":"Gloriously rich and juicy pasta with a crunch of pine kernelsGet a griddle pan or grill hot. Cut a couple of large courgettes into 1cm thick slices, then cook them until they have softened and darkened in patches.While they are cooking, crush 2 or 3 fat, juicy cloves of garlic and put them in a large mixing bowl with the juice of 1 large lemon and 4 tbsp of olive oil. As soon as each piece of courgette is ready, remove it from the heat and lower it into the dressing, pushing it under the surface, and set aside to marinate.Bring a large, deep pan of water to the boil, salt it generously then add 150g of tagliatelle. Toast 50g of pine kernels in a dry pan until pale gold. Tear up 10g of basil leaves and add them, with the pine kernels, to the dressing.Drain the pasta as soon as it is toothsome, then toss with the courgettes and their dressing.If you grill the courgettes dry rather than coated in oil, there is less smoke to contend with. They plump up rather nicely in the olive oil and lemon dressing. You can leave them overnight to really soak into the marinade if you wish, leaving you only the pasta and pine kernels to cook at the last minute.Aubergines are a good substitute for the courgettes. Slice them thinly into rounds or long, thin slices no thicker than a one pound coin. You can introduce other herbs to the marinade – mint and coriander would certainly work well, but also oregano, a herb I am constantly seeking a use for something other than in pizza.Some crumbled feta cheese added with the nuts would be a thoroughly good thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/530e41cd96c715d7e318a08ac3a7439ea581e7ff/0_137_4208_2524/master/4208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068928eac25448155128e51bc389e34b","title":"rachel roddy recipe broccoli ricotta torta","story":"A plump stuffed pizza pie for family days at the beachThere were – and still are for the rest of my family – grey days during our annual camping holidays in Pembrokeshire in Wales when I was growing up: tents that floated away, and rainy-day visits to the butterfly museum. But the many good days – those perfect beach picnic days – shine like Lyle’s golden syrup in our collective memories.Sometimes the sun shone so hard, it burned our backs as we stared into rock pools, then we flung ourselves in the freezing sea to be swallowed up by waves twice our size, our legs turning mottled blue before charging back to the patchwork of towels and rugs. Lunch would have been made that morning. Sandwiches for 15 – ham, ham and cheese, cheese and pickle, all bundled in foil eggs hard-boiled, and sausages fried, then cooled and packed along with pork pies, more cheese, and fruit in the icebox. A pitstop at the shop in Dale for bags of welsh cakes, Jamaica ginger or golden syrup cake and caramel wafers, before our convoy continued down lanes and across the disused airfield so we could all clamber down the path to the beach at Marloes.A foil-wrapped sandwich, a hard-boiled egg and a slice of cake is always tasty, I think – even more so when you are wrapped in a towel with sand between your toes. Picnics are a thrilling reversal of normal rules: air instead of walls, sand in place of tables, fingers where knives and forks would otherwise be called for licence to reach and grab, to swirl eggshells into the sand to lie down and close your eyes for a while, before eating again. Sand in both suncream and sandwich and reports from one child that another has fallen off a rock or found false teeth in the surf only made things more thrilling.On the other side of Europe, meanwhile, my partner Vincenzo and his Sicilian family had their own picnic habits, which basically meant bringing a cold Sunday lunch and lots of umbrellas to the beach in Gela: tomato- and breadcrumb-laden pizza (which still strikes me as the most unlikely beach picnic fare), a sturdy torte, baked pasta and breadcrumbed meat, and a whole watermelon to bury in the wet sand so it kept cool, which ran the risk of it floating away like an edible buoy.The word “picnic” comes from the french pique nique, meaning you pick your spot and everyone brings something. Our family affairs now are a collision of these two worlds, hard-boiled eggs or cold sausages meeting some sort of sturdy pastry torta with a cheese filling, and slices of shop-bought cake jostling for attention with cold halfmoons of watermelon, ready be dropped in the sand and rinsed in the sea, then eaten.I have several recipes for savoury torta dough, some with yeast, some without. For no reason other than habit, the one I use for a broccoliricotta filling is adapted from Marcella Hazan’s Sicilian sfincini di San Vito, which, unlike the classic deep Sfincini pizza, is a pie with a top and a bottom. It is a sturdy bake, although the yeast means the pastry plumps nicely. For the dough1 tsp dried yeast1 small pinch sugar250g plain flour200ml lukewarm water1 pinch salt1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 tbsp whole milkFor the filling500g broccoli or other greens300g ricotta1 egg5 tbsp grated parmesanSalt and pepperDry breadcrumbsPut the yeast in a large bowl, add a third of the water, stir and leave for 10 minutes. Add half the flour and another third of water, a pinch of salt and sugar, the oil and milk and stir until smooth. Finally, add the last third of water and the rest of the flour and bring everything together into a soft, compact dough.Turn on to an oiled board and knead and fold for five minutes, pat into a ball, return to an oiled bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to rise for three hours.Meanwhile, make the filling: boil the broccoli until tender, drain and leave to cool. In a large bowl mash the broccoli with the ricotta, egg, parmesan, salt and black pepper. Taste to make sure you have a well flavoured filling.Set the oven to 200C390Fgas 6 and put a flat baking tray in to heat. Divide the dough in half. Working on a piece of greaseproof paper (so you can slide the pie off later) roll one half into a circle of 25cm diameter, sprinkle with dry breadcrumbs – keeping an inch (2.5cm) short of the edges, and then spread the filling over the crumbs. Finish with a zig-zag of oil in a thin stream. Roll the second half of the dough into a disc large enough to cover the first, lay it over the filling, and press the edges of the dough together to seal.Slide the pie on to the hot tray, brush with a mixture of water and olive oil or beaten egg and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden. Leave it to rest for at least 20 minutes before cutting, then wrapping it in foil or a tea towel to take to the picnic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ade4419ee3c19292d3990f74a4a645efca3337ed/0_11_999_599/master/999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190b9331b34036033fcd4091e1dd7eef","title":"beyond poppies six things you didnt know about the royal british legion","story":"From supporting veterans in emergency situations to providing breaks for service families, Legion initiatives offer a vital helping hand to serving and former members of the armed forcesBeing a member of the armed forces can be high risk and many personnel leave with life-changing injuries. The Royal British Legion provides high quality recovery and rehabilitation support to ex-service personnel who find themselves wounded, injured, sick, or who are experiencing multiple challenges such as being out of work, dealing with mental health problems, financial issues and alcohol abuse.The programme’s flagship is the £27m Battle Back Centre at Lilleshall in the West Midlands, which provides sports and adventure activities designed to promote self-confidence and improve motivation to aid recovery. Tailored programmes help the wounded cope with both physical and psychological challenges.For most, leaving the armed forces means starting a completely new career. The Legion offers a wide range of services designed to help ex-service men and women find employment including Civvy Street – a dedicated website, which lists job vacancies and provides online training resources and information on changing careers. The Legion can also provide funding for additional training or education through its employment support grant scheme.Anyone planning on starting a business will also be supported in their ambition. The Legion provides guidance on business plans, finances and tax requirements. Specialist assistance is also available to put together a business plan, source funding and even find mentors.Not everyone is a DIY whiz and not all former members of the services are equipped to tackle repair jobs. However, rather than booking a handyman, The Royal British Legion provides a handy van service across 21 counties to help with minor home adaptations and repairs for older or less able veterans and their families. The fully trained team assists with maintenance round the home – covering everything from putting up shelves and grab rails to building access ramps and storage sheds to provide shelter for personal mobility vehicles.They can also install the Legion’s system of care phones. A type of personal alarm, a care phone is a telephone-based unit worn on a user’s wrist or neck that can be used to summon help in an emergency.It can be tough and stressful for families and children of those serving in the armed forces. Often some light relief can make a real difference, but taking a much-needed holiday can prove difficult for those on a tight budget. The Legion provides a range of welfare services including week-long adventure breaks for children. These breaks offer a great opportunity for youngsters to have fun, make new friends, have new experiences and improve their self-esteem while giving parents a well-earned break.Parents are not left out either. Week-long breaks for service families are offered at four Legion centres in traditional British seaside resorts during the Easter, summer and October school holidays. Guests are free to take in the sea air while exploring the coast or visiting local tourist attractions. The breaks offer rest and recuperation for people recovering from life-changing events such as illness or bereavement.In the UK today, one in six people over 80 has dementia and by 2025 more than a million people could have the condition. Inevitably, former members of the services feature in these figures. The Royal British Legion provides care in the shape of its purpose built dementia wings at four of its six residential care homes in Somerset, Warwickshire, Norfolk and north Yorkshire, as well as specialist, admiral nurses – developed in partnership with Dementia UK – who work in the community. Currently operating in Lancashire, the west Midlands, Hampshire and Somerset, admiral nurses offer specialist support, information and advice to the family carers of people living with dementia within the armed forces community.Leaving the armed forces means having to deal with an array of financial issues that can be confusing if you’re not prepared for them. Bring in The Royal British Legion’s team of benefits and money advisers. This financial team provides support and guidance in the event ex-service people and their families suffer money problems or need guidance to help set up a new home or access benefits. It also provides help with debt and other unexpected crises, plus support through grants.The Legion has set up MoneyForce, a dedicated website designed to improve understanding of financial issues with information on essentials such as interest charges or buying a home. Managed in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and Standard Life Charitable Trust, the scheme has saved beneficiaries £70m through increases in benefits, tax credits, writing off debts and gaining grants since it began in 2007. It gives ex-service men and women the skills they need to manage their money, smoothing the transition to civilian life.To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0086b181548bd323ca738abff8b831cd9a3b/0_210_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0aa9bb2d8930295ed85386d22b40d55","title":"how one marine lost his dream job but found meaning helping other veterans","story":"When a freak injury ended marine Nick Fleming’s chances of ever seeing active deployment, he left the services unsure of what to do next. But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa0e28665fd99272ec5c61f828aa16a4649aadb/0_40_1818_1091/master/1818.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4200fd2a6227c497e4d9dee457a308c","title":"club chai djs parties nightlife dance music oakland california","story":"The founders of Oakland’s erse east-meets-west nights explain their inclusive, experimental ethosAsk the two DJs behind Club Chai what type of music they play at their sweaty warehouse parties in Oakland, California, and you’ll be met with an awkward pause. There’s no easy answer to that question – which is one of the major reasons why Club Chai has struck such a chord with its ultra-erse, thrill-seeking audience, from the artists and activists of its hometown to its swelling global fanbase.“Club Chai,” explains co-founder Lara Sarkissian, who also makes music under the name Foozool, “is where I play the weird shit that I want to experiment with for the first time.” In partnership with Esra Canoğullari, also known as 8ULENTINA, the Club Chai DJs aim to bridge the gap between western and non-western music while recognising their diasporic heritage – Sarkissian’s family is Armenian, while Canoğullari has Turkish roots. Club Chai sets are as irreverent as they are cutting-edge: a DJ destruction derby where tempos, rhythms and genres collide, often highlighting hidden connections across the global underground.A typical set may hop between Armenian and Turkish pop songs, Egyptian electro chaabi, Arabic dabke, the Brooklyn dancehall mutation known as FDM, the hypnotic drums of South African gqom and ferocious club tracks from labels like NON Worldwide and Night Slugs. “We always have wild card moments at our parties where people will drop a random song,” says Canoğullari. “I’ve definitely played some black metal in the middle of my set before! But I only really do that at our parties knowing that our crowd gets it and will go there with us.”Though they never set out to build a specific audience, their anti-tokenistic attitude has attracted clubbers who identify with the lesser-heard voices and cultures in their music – not just people of colour, but women, trans, queer and non-binary people too. “It really encompasses all the identities, as an intersectional thing,” says Sarkissian. The party’s community identity maps right on to Oakland, a city that’s long been a hotbed of community activism – the black panthers were founded there in the 60s – but is now grappling with gentrification and the displacement of its historically black and Latinx population. “It all ties back to the music we’re playing because the music goes back to these communities, so they’re down with it and they all end up in this space.”After honing their DJ skills in a local bar, Sarkissian and Canoğullari put on the first Club Chai in January 2016, taking over a small brick room at an artists’ warehouse in West Oakland. The lineup for that first party encapsulated the Club Chai concept: Philadelphia’s DJ Haram, an expert at blending western and eastern music, electro cumbia specialist Turbo Sonidero, and local artists Neto 187 and Jasmine Infiniti, a trans activist who mixes up vogue, industrial and techno. “I won’t forget that day,” recalls Sarkissian. “We had a few friends who helped us and I remember the moment when we were setting up our own bar – it was super DIY, but we were all so excited.” Meanwhile, Canoğullari was “freaking out” about putting together a sound system for the first time. “I was carrying around these massive subs and I didn’t know what I was doing! I wasn’t experienced so I felt really conscious about everything.” The sense of achievement when they pulled it off convinced them of the power of DIY nightlife. “I remember how many people were involved in helping us, how much care and effort we put into it. It was a very communal thing.”Since the launch, they’ve set up a label (a second compilation of globally sourced Club Chai artists is expected soon), put on DJ workshops and hosted several parties outside of Oakland. Their warm reception in London, in particular, proved to them “how strong diasporic culture is,” says Canoğullari. “Seeing things translate beyond our local scene was really affirming and exciting.”Club Chai happens every two or three months in Oakland finding the right venue is a constant challenge. Artists’ warehouses have long provided vital infrastructure for the city’s disjointed nightlife scene, but in the wake of a deadly fire at the Ghost Ship warehouse in December 2016, a crackdown on venues without permits has limited their options. “Honestly, right now we’re not sure where the next one is going to be,” says Sarkissian. “But it’s exciting,” adds Canoğullari, “because it seems like our crowd is willing to follow us around.”They’re proud to note that Club Chai has inspired a younger generation to take matters into their own hands. “There’s always been a long history of DJ crews in the Bay Area, but people are really excited about dance music again,” says Sarkissian. “More young kids are trying to learn how to DJ. So many people are like, ‘Can you teach me? When are you guys doing another workshop?’ So that’s exciting for us – there are a lot of new artists to engage with.”Oakland remains a fertile habitat for creative people, but in economic terms, it can’t compete with cultural powerhouses such as LA or New York. The scene is either DIY, or it doesn’t happen at all – but for Club Chai’s co-founders, that’s an inspiring situation. “At a certain point, people realise we have to take it upon ourselves to make these spaces and get together and organise,” says Sarkissian. “It’s up to us.”Pinch \u0026amp Islam Chipsy ft Sadat: Elpapa Men HebtohEsra Canoğullari: “I play lots of Egyptian mahraganat in my DJ sets, but this track is one of my favourites to throw in.

It gives the dancefloor a house party vibe for a second.”LeoKarlo: Enjoy YourselfLara Sarkissian: “I love playing this coupé-décalé track from LeoKarlo in the last bit of my set to change the mood – it’s a super dreamy and pretty track that gets me reflective when listening and is a nice cool-down for the dancefloor.”Vartan Taymazyan ft Kamini: TarelaLS: “It’s fun throwing Armenian pop tracks into my sets if the percussion and sound can fit into other tracks I’m playing, and this is definitely one of them. I play this at Club Chai because our crowd is always down to hear something new. For this one, Vartan Taymazyan featured Indian artist Kamini with a combination of Armenian dance rhythms and Indian pop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdce96832a51d4d26f9c5ca9a128a5a6ebaa8775/0_0_3318_2212/master/3318.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=36e0bbc00b7757992e98bb4533d63cd4 1400w","title":"brexit no 10 to re table its meaningful vote amendment after lords defeat","story":"Final showdown with Tory rebels likely after No 10 says it cannot accept peers’ versionThe government “cannot accept” a Lords amendment giving parliament a “meaningful vote” on a Brexit deal, and will re-table its rejected version, Downing Street has said, setting up a final showdown with Tory rebels on the issue this week.Theresa May put off a likely Commons defeat last week by promising rebels a compromise on the issue in the EU withdrawal bill. However, the eventual government amendment did not go as far as one drafted by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general.When the bill returned to the Lords on Monday, peers passed another amendment, based on Grieve’s proposals and tabled by Lord Hailsham, by 119 votes, a bigger majority than the first time the issue was in the upper house.Asked if May was confident about getting her version through the Commons, her spokesman said the Lords had agreed with the Commons on the majority of issues with the bill voted about on Monday, such as customs union membership and environmental protections. He said on Tuesday: “But we cannot accept the amendment on meaningful vote agreed in the Lords. Agreeing to amendable motions would allow parliament to direct government on its approach to exiting the EU, binding the prime minister’s hands and making it harder to secure a good deal for the UK.“It also does not meet the reasonable tests set out last week by the prime minister and the secretary of state for exiting the European Union that any new amendment must respect the referendum result, cannot undermine the negotiations or change the constitutional role of parliament and government.“Our original amendment struck the right balance between respecting the tests set out by the government as well as delivering on the aims of Dominic Grieve’s own amendment. That’s why we will be re-tabling our original amendment today and will look to overturn the Lords decision tomorrow.”Re-tabling the government’s amendment, which has been roundly rejected by Grieve and other Tory rebels, sets up a vote on the issue on Wednesday, when the ping-pong process return the bill to the Commons.Earlier on Tuesday, Grieve had said he and the other rebels were not trying to bring down the government, but said a meaningful vote before leaving the EU may help to avoid a crisis moment.Grieve was criticised in some newspapers over the weekend when he suggested he could “collapse the government” and said he woke up in a cold sweat thinking about it.Grieve said the new amendment was “a mechanism by which the House of Commons could express a view, without moving to a motion of no confidence, which could collapse the government.“All of us must hope this doesn’t happen. But there is a risk it will happen, and if we have no deal at the very end it is a serious crisis.”Several MPs have suggested Grieve’s amendment is unnecessary. The Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat said MPs would be “looking for a new government” if the current one failed to deliver a Brexit deal that could pass the Commons.Grieve said he did not want to leave such a situation to chance. “If we get to a situation where we are three weeks away from no deal … the idea that it’s a good moment to get a new prime minister, have a general election … it doesn’t seem to me a good moment, if it can be avoided,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cab9cff4ee7b7b4400779a5d44c24142bc1b23e/0_0_1931_1159/master/1931.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=313d25f778279a4f8952b7ad6c124faa","title":"primary school children affected by hygiene poverty charity finds","story":"One in four families surveyed have gone without toiletries because of financial difficultiesPrimary school children are arriving for their lessons unwashed and in dirty clothes because their parents cannot afford to buy washing powder, soap or shampoo, according to a survey by a UK charity.Schools are intervening to support struggling families who are having to choose between food or personal hygiene. More than half of primary teachers who took part in a parallel survey said they provide pupils with washing powder, soap and shampoo on a weekly basis because of family hygiene poverty issues.Child psychologist Dr Richard Woolfson said: “Children’s self-esteem is greatly affected by the reaction of those around them – and if they are stigmatised, ridiculed or rejected by their peers because of poor basic hygiene, their sense of self-worth will quickly nose-e. “No child wants to be taunted because they are dirty, or because their clothes are filthy. They’ll start to lose interest in their education, their friendships will suffer, and they’ll be reluctant to attend school.”Nicola Finney, the head teacher at St Paul’s Church of England primary school in Stoke-on-Trent, said she was having to dip into the school budget to supply toiletries, washing powder, toothpaste and deodorant as an increasing number of families could not afford to buy their own.“We have seen significantly more children coming into school with washing and hygiene issues over the last few years,” she said. “It used to be just a couple of children across the school, but now there are two or three in every classroom dealing with these issues.”Finney said she had spent hundreds of pounds of her own money helping pupils to buy these items because she couldn’t bear to see them go without. “On one occasion I bought a washing machine for a family who had just had a newborn baby and had nowhere to wash their clothes.“We have been considering installing a washing machine in school and we stockpile spare, washed uniforms so pupils can get changed and sent home clean – and nobody is any the wiser that we have stepped in to help.”The survey which involved 2,000 parents of primary school children and 100 teachers across the UK was commissioned by the charity In Kind Direct, which receives donated goods from companies and distributes them to UK charities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb9d182afa9a861fb49a335ca23d27f87baa97fb/0_184_596_358/master/596.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b54ef285e9063d5277c9a8171e5b82d","title":"thousands of public buildings and spaces england sold off councils private developers","story":"Councils selling majority to private developers not community groups, says reportMore than 4,000 public buildings and spaces in England are being sold off every year, with more than 7,000 others at risk over the next five years, a charity has said.Locality says the majority of the sites being offloaded by local authorities are sold to private developers for the highest price, forever lost to communities around them. The charity wants the government to create a £200m-a-year community ownership fund for the next five years to help preserve the buildings and spaces for the use of local people. Tony Armstrong, its chief executive, said: “This is a sell-off on a massive scale. We know that many of the buildings being lost have valuable community uses. “Everyone of us can think of a local public building or outside space we love and use, from libraries to lidos and town halls to youth centres. They are owned by the public and they’re being sold off for short-term gain to fill holes in council budgets. “Many hundreds of local community groups are stepping up and fighting for community ownership. But they urgently need support and help with startup costs if they are to compete with the commercial developers.” Faced with the need to make savings of £90m over the next three years, Liverpool city council has decided to sell the Grade II*-listed Municipal Buildings, having deemed the 150-year-old structure “surplus to requirements”. One bidder wants to turn it into a five-star hotel.The council has approved a deal with developer Mastcraft to turn the Grade II-listed building into a 140-bed boutique hotel. The deal is for a 245-year lease but the council will retain the east wing for civic use.A plan for the Far East Consortium to redevelop the 1935 Grade II*-listed building, reputed to be the venue where in 1971 Queen played their first\u0026nbsp​concert, was approved in October. Despite a petition signed by nearly 7,000 people, the £27m sale is due to be confirmed next month.The Victorian baths, dating from 1904, have been sold to private-equity firm Castleforge Partners, which says the building will house an art gallery, offices, affordable workspaces, pop-ups, shops, cafés, a health centre and food stalls.The historic Grade II-listed former theatre, where Laurel\u0026nbsp​and Hardy, Nina Simone and George Formby performed, was sold at auction for £325,000 last year after an attempt by the Friends of Hulme Hippodrome to get it listed as an asset of community value was rejected by the council.Built in 1891, the Victorian building fell into disrepair and was empty. A group of residents came together to save the institute in 2014 when Kirklees council was selling off publicly owned buildings. It now includes a library, a fully accessible post office, an office for Meltham town council, offices for local firms and start-ups and a school of dance, as well as three large spaces used by community groups.The oldest Grade II-listed baths still open for public swimming in the UK were set to close in July 2017 but the Edwardian building has remained open as a communit-run venue.The 650-foot Victorian pier used to ferry passengers to the opposite bay was left unused and in disrepair for many years. Thanks to local people buying shares for £25 each, £62,000 was raised and the pier was saved in February this year.Horton Chapel, a Grade II-listed Edwardian chapel built as part of the then new Horton Asylum and designed to accommodate hundreds of patients and staff, stood vacant for many years. In 2016, the Horton Chapel Arts and Heritage Society came together to save it as a not-for-profit art centre.The 1930s Grade II-listed swimming pool complex was closed by the council in 2009 but it has since agreed to give community ownership to a group of local residents, the Byrne Avenue Trust.The Great British Sell Off report is published on Tuesday and is based on freedom of information requests sent to all 353 local authorities in England. Locality received 55 responses on the number of buildings and spaces sold between the financial years 2012-13 and 2016-17, as well as 127 replies about sites identified as surplus over the next five years, extrapolating the results to obtain national totals. Only two fifths of councils (based on 233 responses) said they had a strategy to support community ownership, known as a community asset transfer policy. Locality wants all councils to have one of these policies, giving community groups first right of refusal to buy public buildings and for them to have a year, rather than six months, to draw up a proposal.In Hastings residents were left furious on Saturday after it was confirmed the town’s pier had been sold to a businessman for a fraction of what it cost to rebuild. Sheikh Abid Gulzar reportedly paid £50,000, while the Friends of Hastings Pier group had raised £477,000 of its £500,000 target to buy it.In West Yorkshire, residents are trying to save the former Dewsbury Museum, closed by the council in 2016 after 120 years owing to financial pressures. Jax Lovelock, who chairs the Dewsbury Park Mansion community hub, said the aim was for the building to be used for health and wellbeing services, as well as space for startups and community events. “Over the last 10 to 15 years, our town as well as towns all over the country have had their civic hearts stripped out of them,” she said. “Communities will get off their backsides and do things for themselves but they need that guidance and support to be able to do that.”Locality said austerity was to blame for the sell-off, a view shared by the Local Government Association. Richard Watts, who chairs the LGA’s resources board, said: “Local councillors, elected by local people, understand the deep connection communities have with their public spaces and buildings. If we are to be able to maintain them and fund frontline services, the government must address our funding shortfall of over £5bn a year by 2020 as soon as possible.”A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said councils had £90.7bn to spend on local services over the next two years, which they were responsible for spending wisely. He added: “All local authorities must properly consider the risks and opportunities before making commercial decisions.“We are working with local government to develop a funding system for the future based on the needs of different areas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/514b717e9ca7604a461bdb471c984d6da210726c/227_292_2969_1782/master/2969.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=704ea5035b9a03d585f36a7db884ff7a","title":"england v australia third one day international live","story":"“We enjoy chasing as a general rule of thumb and it looks a fantastic wicket,” says Eoin Morgan, who would also have bowled first.Australia win the toss and will bowl first. “The wicket looks great and I think it’ll stay that way for the whole contest,” says Tim Paine.“It looks an absolute road,” says Mike Atherton, at Trent Bridge for the toss.Over the last 10 years Trent Bridge has been the third most batsman-friendly ground in ODI cricket in England, with batsmen averaging 36.46 runs, fully 10 runs more than at Old Trafford.Aaron Finch says Australia have “full confidence that, if we play to our full ability and push that for 100 overs rather than 60 or 80 overs, our best is still good enough”.

He says: “Our contract with Al Shaqab runs until July. Frankie is available to ride for them if required.” So it appears the Qatari owners have made their own decision to use other jockeys on their Royal Ascot runners this week, even though one of the finest of Flat jockeys is still under contract to ride for them. Instead, they have allowed him to ride against them and I dare say he will need no extra motivation. How very strange. If I hear any explanation from Al Shaqab, I shall pass it on.Today’s odds: 5-2 Blue, 3-1 Pink, 4-1 Green, 8-1 Purple, 12-1 WhiteCream and 16-1 Orange.The official runners and riders are in for the Royal Procession, and the Queen is in capital letters.1st CarriageTHE QUEEN The Princess RoyalThe Duke of YorkThe Lord Vestey 2nd CarriageThe Prince of WalesThe Duchess of CornwallPrincess Beatrice of YorkPrincess Eugenie of York 3rd CarriageThe Duke of SussexThe Duchess of SussexThe Earl of WessexThe Countess of Wessex 4th CarriagePrince Michael of KentPrincess Michael of KentThe Lord de MauleyThe Lady de MauleyI will be writing about the royals this week. There’s a clue in the meeting’s name. First of all we have the news that Harry and Meghan Markle, officially the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, are at the races today, which will be the most exciting thing about the whole week for many. Now comes news that the Queen will have a runner in tomorrow’s Royal Hunt Cup as Seniority has got into the famous mile handicap after only being second reserve. Two horses that were originally entered went lame. Now that’s lucky. In March Royal Ascot announced a ban this week on gentlemen of the ‘no socks’ variety. Apparently, visible bra straps and fake tan are also verboten, though that might need a check. It was a Sun report. So, how will this sock edict be enforced? One scribe is suggesting there might well be masons among Ascot officials. God forbid.Entries for Royal Ascot suggest the association between Frankie Dettori and the powerful Qatari owners Al Shaqab is at an end. Al Shaqab have four runners declared to run here over the next two days, all of which Dettori rode when they last ran, but all have other jockeys booked this time and Dettori is riding against all four, mostly on John Gosden-trained runners. We’ll pass on any official comment from the parties as soon as we have it. It was reported in January that Al Shaqab had halved Dettori’s pay for this year, on the grounds that they expected to have fewer runners in Britain. Before that, Al Shaqab was having cashflow problems that led to several of their trainers being owed significant sums for months on end.Are you planning to travel by train to Royal Ascot? I have numerous times and, you won’t be surprised to hear given the mess on Network Rail recently, there have been issues. If you’re going to the meeting this week and don’t fancy the crush on the choo-choo then help may be at hand. Zeelo, the on-demand coach service, are running a fleet to the track each day. Leather seats, tables, wi-fi and toilets on board. Plus champagne on arrival and a selection of breakfast nibbles. All for less than £40. Sounds good value to me and Zeelo recently introduced an offer the other day where racegoers can travel for just £5 return if they book by entering the promo code “RoyalAscot” on its website here. Seats are subject to availability by the way so would be best to snap up the offer as soon as possible. And no I’m not getting a backhander. I just hate travelling by train to this meeting and think others ought to know about the alternatives.Sir Michael Stoute 75Aidan O’Brien 61John Gosden 43Mark Johnston 41Saeed bin-Suroor 35Paul Cole 21Mick Channon 18Stoute failed to have a winner at Ascot last year, for only the second time since 1995. Just to rub it in, his tally of 75 matches the trainer’s record set by the much-missed Sir Henry Cecil, so Stoute had to spend the whole week fielding questions from the media about when he was going to get the record to himself. Press folk are, of course, noted for their humanity, so I dare say it will be a similar story this week. At least he’s got runners on Day One this time, four of them in fact, which makes four more than he had on this day a year ago. Aidan O’Brien is showing everyone else how the game is played, with at least one runner in every race and 12 in total. Gosden has a more restrained five but they do include Without Parole, favourite for the big race at 4.20pm.“Benbatl is the worst loser of the day,” quoth Paddy Power’s on-course representative, Paul Binfield, already into full-on despair mode, as if there’s much for bookies to worry about. The Godolphin runner is 9-2 from 5-1 for the Queen Anne, which opens today’s proceedings at 2.30pm. The other one Paddy doesn’t want, apparently, is Battaash (3.40), as they have made a trading decision to keep Lady Aurelia onside in the King’s Stand, with the result that their book for that race has an unbalanced look. Advertise (3.05) is 12-1 from 18s for the Coventry, the firm reports. Later on the card, punters are evidently putting their faith in Ryan Moore, whose mount Chelkar (5.00) is 11-2 from 7s for the Ascot Stakes, while Yucatan (5.35) is 8-1 from 9s in the Wolferton, though there has also been some interest in Morando (11-1 from 12s) for the closing contest.Frankie Dettori 56 winsRyan Moore 48Jamie Spencer 24William Buick 20Olivier Peslier 16(highest career totals for currently licensed jockeys)Ryan Mighty has been top jockey at Royal Ascot seven times in the past eight years, beaten only in that time by Johnny Murtagh in 2013. But he’ll face a bit more competition this year than last, when Frankie Dettori was a late absentee. The Italian had better crack on with a few winners here, or Moore will be past his career total in a year or two. Dettori hasn’t been top dog in this week since 2004, when he was a stripling of 33 summers. Whatever happens, just remember that he’s not retiring!Here’s how the big two match up for rides today: 2.30 Dettori: (feet up) Moore: Rhododendron 4-13.05 Dettori: Calyx 3-1 Moore: Sergei Prokofiev 3-13.40 Dettori: (resting) Moore: Different League 22-14.20 Dettori: Without Parole 100-30 Moore: U S Navy Flag 5-15.00 Dettori: (forty winks) Moore: Chelkar 11-25.35 Dettori: Monarchs Glen 12-1 Moore: Yucatan 8-1There’s a guaranteed Royal Ascot pic on the front-pages tomorrow ...Despair, all those who wanted a bit of cut in the ground for this week’s racing. The going is officially described as ‘good to firm, good in places’, while GoingStick readings (8.6 or higher for the straight course, 7.8 for the round) suggest there might not be much of that ‘good in places’. The forecast is dry, warm and breezy, we are advised by the clerk of the course, Chris Stickels. He expects to put some water down after racing throughout the week, to prevent the track drying out any further.Fast-ground horses should be in their element and anything with significant powers of acceleration will have every chance to show it this week. Grinders are going to find themselves outpaced. Hold-up horses may find that the ones in front are not getting tired fast enough.The big question ahead of the week’s big-field handicaps is which side of the straight course is the right place to be. Action here last month suggested those drawn low might have an advantage but that can be no more than a tentative suggestion, particularly because jockey behaviour has so much to do with draw biases or perception of same.2.30 Queen Anne Stakes Few trainers would be more grateful for a big win at this Royal Ascot than Saeed bin Suroor, who has made a quiet start to the European flat-racing season, while Godolphin’s other Newmarket yard produced the goods in the Derby. Bin Suroor fields Benbatl, whose Dubai Turf success in March is just about the best form on offer and who won a Group Three in this week a year ago. But horses who have a busy Dubai campaign early in the year cannot be relied on to pick up in midsummer where they left off in spring, so a better option might be the progressive French raider, Recoletos. From an in-form yard, he delivered a career-best performance to win the Ispahan last month and he travelled well for a long way behind Cracksman in the Champion Stakes before failing to stay. He is preferred to Rhododendron, who had everything fall right for her in the Lockinge.3.05 Coventry Stakes Calyx is the sexy one here, the son of Kingman having looked so very zippy on his debut at Newmarket 10 days ago. But he won that race with a killer burst of pace and could find that weapon being taken from him by an end-to-end gallop this time. Sergei Prokofiev is a short price for a horse stepping up in distance, so the suggestion is the imposing Cosmic Law, who showed a lot of improvement to land the Woodcote on Derby weekend.3.40 King’s Stand Stakes Possibly continuing a good day for French raiders, Finsbury Square could outrun big odds here. A veteran of 35 races, he produced a career best on his first run since joining Mauricio Delcher Sanchez, who won this race 10 years ago with Equiano. Whether Finsbury Square can repeat that effort to score at Chantilly a fortnight ago is one question that must be answered but he was only beaten three lengths in the Diamond Jubilee last year and any improvement would make him very dangerous. Lady Aurelia needs no introduction but she has started her two previous seasons strongly, so her reappearance defeat is a concern. Battaash is a huge talent but this atmosphere will be a real test for a temperamental sort and his stable is out of form.4.20 St James’s Palace Stakes There’s a lot to be said for latching onto a star horse before every other punter has spotted his talent but an excess of faith can be expensive, a lesson which possibly awaits those who have made Without Parole favourite for the St James’s Palace Stakes. The highlight race on day one of Royal Ascot generally features a clash between Classic winners but this colt is stepping straight up from Listed company and, while he might be able to manage it with John Gosden’s help, odds of 11-4 make no appeal. A more orthodox favourite would be Romanised, winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineasand beaten only by Masar, the Derby winner, when he last came to Britain in September. I don’t think there was any fluke about his Curragh win last month, when he produced a really strong finish to reel in U S Navy Flag. On a fast surface here, there is a risk that that rival could pinch a handy lead off the home turn but Romanised is the way to bet at 11-2. Tip Two Win can go well again but might lack the necessary finishing kick.5.00 Ascot Handicap The record of Willie Mullins means that all five of his are worth a look but perhaps Alan King can trump the Irishman this time with Coeur De Lion. Place prize money has been his speciality in marathon Flat handicaps but he was a shade unlucky when a rival got first run on him at Chester last time and the cheekpieces fitted that day can help him again. Martin Harley, who has done well for King in recent weeks, gets his first chance aboard this one.5.35 Wolferton Stakes There is no shame in having been beaten by a Charle Appleby runner on Guineas weekend this year, a time when the Godolphin man was close to unbeatable. Sharja Bridge went down by just half a length that day, was well clear of the third and is ready for this step up into Listed company.You could win a £50 bet from Ladbrokes by proving your tipping prowess on today’s races.

It is a day for the purists, or that is how the theory went, at least. Three Group One races, and still space to move around before the crowds really build towards the end of the week.In fact, the first-day attendance has been outstripping the crowd for Wednesday’s card for quite a few years now, perhaps as a result of the decision to stage nearly half of the meeting’s entire roster of Group One events before 4.30pm on the opening afternoon. But the live audience of maybe 45,000 will still be nothing like the 70,000 or so expected for the final three days, and nowhere near the 55,000 who turned up for the opening day when Ascot unveiled its shiny new grandstand back in 2006.The fact that Ascot gets so many of the main events out of the way almost before anyone has drawn breath remains a bit of a puzzle.The track no longer runs all three of Tuesday’s Group Ones at the top of the card, having inserted the Coventry Stakes – which is a Group One in all but name – as the second race of the day but three Group Ones just feels like too many when the remaining five are spread out over the next four days. None will get the attention they deserve, and one – probably the Queen Anne this time around – is likely to feel like an afterthought by this evening.That is because the King’s Stand Stakes, the third race of the meeting, is arguably the most eagerly anticipated event of all, as it pits Battaash and Lady Aurelia against each other in a hell-for-leather dash down the straight. The St James’s Palace Stakes, meanwhile, is the official highlight of the day and there is a real chance that David, in the form of Roger Teal’s Tip Two Win, will knock out a small army of Goliaths from the biggest bloodstock operations in the business.Away from the Group One action, Calyx versus Sergei Prokofiev in the Coventry Stakes will probably decide the early favourite for next year’s 2,000 Guineas, while the Ascot Stakes at 5.00 has several possible “plunge” horses lurking in the field, including Stratum, in the colours of Tony Bloom, whose Withhold landed a huge gamble in another big staying handicap, the Cesarewitch, last year.The going at Ascot is officially good-to-firm and the forecast is for a generally dry and warm week. The stage is set for a fabulous week of racing, and it all gets under way at 2.30pm BST."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b3ddf9a568a66b7dc18d750afa6465fd068eeaf/58_54_3442_2065/master/3442.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ade1e3c1a1a3c7f553530ae20697b06f","title":"wing commander the artist putting on a light show with 1500 pigeons","story":"They swoop, they soar, they light up the sky … meet the pigeon-fancier who has trained his flock to wear LEDs and perform a hypnotic night danceYou can see them in the sky long before you get close, circling high above, wheeling and ing between each other, their wings flashing in the sunshine and making a faintly mechanical whirr each time they pass overhead.

Though genetically similar to feral pigeons, these birds are specialist varieties that were selectively bred over thousands of years for their endurance and acrobatic abilities. “Most are tipplers and rollers,” says Riley. He’s a compact man with blue eyes, a square jaw and hands that look as though they are used to making things. “These are the birds people fly in New York, but they’re all English breeds originally.” There’s something knowingly old-fashioned about Riley. He wears overalls with the word “Duke” embroidered on the pocket and speaks in a hard Boston lilt. In Europe, most fanciers, as pigeon-keepers are called, are interested in racing: they take their birds away from their lofts and time how long it takes them to fly back. But in the rest of the world, it’s more of a spectator sport. Fanciers will breed a flock (or “kit”) of birds, then train them using flags and whistles to fly tightly together over their loft. In competition, points are awarded for style and time in the air, or for attracting your opponents’ birds into your flock. Riley grew up in Boston and now lives in Brooklyn, places that were once hotbeds of this kind of flying, which is now in decline in the west. He has been obsessed with pigeons ever since, as a boy, he found a lost homing pigeon and looked after it in his garage. “My mother told me to let it go,” he says, “so I did. But it kept coming back. I didn’t know anything about pigeons back then. I thought I was St Anthony.” Anthony is the patron saint of lost things, famous for his ability to speak to animals. While at art school in Providence, Rhode Island, Riley lived in an old pigeon coop at the top of an apartment building, sharing it with feral city birds. Then he met a fancier who showed him what a well trained kit could do, and he quickly became hooked. “I lived there for four years,” he says, “and I became obsessed.” He has kept pigeons ever since, wherever he’s lived. “Sometimes I was just flying a couple of birds out the bathroom window or the fire escape, but I always maintained that interest.” There are 1,500 pigeons in this loft at Thamesmead, and they require a lot of looking after. Riley and his team give them food and water twice a day, and clean out a wheelie bin’s worth of droppings every week. “It’s great fertiliser,” he says. Their health is carefully monitored, too. In the medical bay, eight birds are being treated for various ailments and injuries. They are cared for by the vet who looked after the owls on the set of the Harry Potter movies. Slivers of lemon are added to their drinking water. “Sometimes we give them garlic, too,” Riley says. “It’s good for their digestion.” For three nights this week, Riley will stage performances of his celebrated work Fly By Night – an interspecies collaboration between the artist and his birds. Tiny LED lights will be attached to the feet of the pigeons, and they will then fly around the loft in front of an audience as the sun sets. When the piece was first performed, at a naval yard in Brooklyn, it was greeted with wild acclaim. In video footage of the event, the pigeons become specks of moving light, scoring abstract shapes on to the dusky sky in a hypnotic, gyrating, extraordinary dance. Duke has brought the project to London as part of 14-18 NOW, an arts programme commemorating the centenary of the end of the first world war. Pigeons played an important role in the war: they were used on the front to deliver messages, many winning medals for their bravery. And the setting for the performance, in an area by the Thames once dominated by munitions factories, reflects that historic connection.Riley’s work has often tackled “the space between the land and the water”. He describes the land as “a hyper-governed space, where there’s all these different systems and laws and societal structures that can be oppressive”. The water, meanwhile, is “the most ungoverned space, a piece of wilderness that still has its own rules that you can’t really control”. His birds fly between these two worlds. Riley’s creations often invoke a playful folk aesthetic. He embroiders, makes scrimshaw (engravings on the tusks of sea mammals), and has a successful sideline as a tattoo artist. There is a heft to the things he makes, and a light-hearted subversiveness to the things he does. Once he created a popup bar on the Brooklyn waterfront using flotsam and jetsam collected from the Hudson River. A few years ago, he built a revolutionary-war replica submarine and sailed it towards the cruise ship Queen Mary II, before being arrested by river police as a potential terrorist. The adventures are as important as the pieces he makes out of them. For his first pigeon work, Trading With the Enemy, he trained homing pigeons to fly to a loft in Key West, Florida, before taking them to Cuba, attaching cigars to their backs in tiny rucksacks, and releasing them. Eleven made it back wearing their contraband.  After he’s finished with them, the birds will be rehomed with local fanciers. Fly By Night is partly a way of drawing attention to a lost or at least dying art. Pigeon-flying has a long history as a working class, counterintuitively urban pursuit, but fanciers are being driven out of cities by rising rents and increasing hostility to birds. “Gentrification is the culprit,” Riley says. “People are freaked out because they think pigeons are diseased, or because they misunderstand pigeon-flying and think it’s abusive. In my opinion, it’s the complete opposite.” Does he think of his work as nostalgic? “I wouldn’t use the word nostalgia necessarily,” he says, “because I think it’s dangerous. But a lot of my projects are about empowering marginal communities. We’re living in a time when technology and nature are at war with each other on many levels, not least for our attention. I want to get people to stop and pay attention to the environment around them.”He sees a correlation between the birds flying and a human drawing. “The movement that the bird makes, or when you have a whole kit of pigeons flying in a murmuration – no machine can replicate that.” In Syria, pigeon-flying is a popular pastime and Riley plans to next stage Fly By Night in a refugee camp there. A few weeks after we meet, I return to Thamesmead to watch an evening rehearsal. It had been raining all day, and Riley was worried about the wind, which was blowing gustily. As dusk fell, he climbed to the roof of his loft. A bell rang and the pigeons took off in a huge clattering cloud. Some flew low over my head. Others climbed higher and higher into the sky until they were almost out of sight. At the centre of it all stood Riley, waving his flag and directing his flock like a manic conductor, his pigeons flying around him in the darkening sky.• Fly By Night is at East Thamesmead, London, 21-23 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f192be5db55971d9b9bf627012f05c3cd15df7ed/0_633_11430_6858/master/11430.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43612a612907f920728d46b5c87cdfaa","title":"artificial intelligence ibm debate project debater","story":"IBM shows off Project Debater, artificial intelligence project designed to make coherent arguments as it processes vast data setsIt was man 1, machine 1 in the first live, public debate between an artificial intelligence system developed by IBM and two human debaters.The AI, called Project Debater, appeared on stage in a packed conference room at IBM’s San Francisco office embodied in a 6ft tall black panel with a blue, animated “mouth”. It was a looming presence alongside the human debaters Noa Ovadia and Dan Zafrir, who stood behind a podium nearby.Although the machine stumbled at many points, the unprecedented event offered a glimpse into how computers are learning to grapple with the messy, unstructured world of human decision-making.For each of the two short debates, participants had to prepare a four-minute opening statement, followed by a four-minute rebuttal and a two-minute summary. The opening debate topic was “we should subsidize space exploration”, followed by “we should increase the use of telemedicine”.In both debates, the audience voted Project Debater to be worse at delivery but better in terms of the amount of information it conveyed. And in spite of several robotic slip-ups, the audience voted the AI to be more persuasive (in terms of changing the audience’s position) than its human opponent, Zafrir, in the second debate.It’s worth noting, however, that there were many members of IBM staff in the room and they may have been rooting for their creation. IBM hopes the research will eventually enable a more sophisticated virtual assistant that can absorb massive and erse sets of information to help build persuasive arguments and make well-informed decisions – as opposed to merely responding to simple questions and commands. Project Debater was a showcase of IBM’s ability to process very large data sets, including millions of news articles across dozens of subjects, and then turn snippets of arguments into full flowing prose – a challenging task for a computer. The machine spoke with a confident female voice with a natural cadence, segues and organisational structure to its speech, but it lacked linguistic precision and argumentative clarity. During the space debate, for example, it repeated the point that space exploration is beneficial to the economy several times using slightly different words. There were also times when the second clause of a sentence didn’t smoothly follow the first clause. At other times, the AI system injected random anecdotes and quotes in a way that didn’t feel entirely natural.At one point, mid-sentence, the AI mentioned the astronaut Scott Kelley and then said “voiceover”, indicating that portion of the argument had been taken from a video transcript. Without hand gestures (well, without hands altogether) or facial expressions, it was also much harder for audience members to stay engaged when listening to the robo-debater.The company has spent six years developing Project Debater’s capabilities, including data-driven speech writing and delivery, listening comprehension for identifying key claims made within a speech, and the ability to formulate principled arguments. It expands upon the capabilities of IBM’s supercomputer Watson, which is being used by companies to mine huge internal data sets – including helping doctors diagnose different types of cancer.The landmark event follows similar battles between man and machine, including IBM’s Deep Blue program beating Gary Kasparov at chess, Google’s AI program AlphaGo beating the world’s best players at the strategy board game Go and a program called Libratus beating four of the world’s top poker players at no-limit Texas Hold ’Em. Using language and reasoning to debate is a far more complicated game. “The rules of chess are very few. The board is very small and the number of pieces is tiny. Even for Go, where the board is substantially larger, we’re still talking about an extremely bounded and well defined space,” said Chris Reed, a professor at the Centre for Argument Technology at the University of Dundee, who attended the debate. “With language, it’s not nearly so clear,” he said. “There’s a lot more flexibility in what constitutes a turn and the rules of the game.”Once an AI is capable of persuasive arguments, it can be applied as a tool to aid human decision-making. “We believe there’s massive potential for good in artificial intelligence that can understand us humans,” said Arvind Krishna, director of IBM Research.One example of this might be corporate boardroom decisions, where there are lots of conflicting points of view. The AI system could, without emotion, listen to the conversation, take all of the evidence and arguments into account and challenge the reasoning of humans where necessary. “This can increase the level of evidence-based decision-making,” said Reed, adding that the same system could be used for intelligence analysis in counter-terrorism, for example identifying if a particular inidual represents a threat.In both cases, the machine wouldn’t make the decision but would contribute to the discussion and act as another voice at the table. While the debate may seem like a stunt, Reed believes it to be an important demonstration of the limits of artificial intelligence. “It helps the public understand where the state of the art is, which means panics about the imminent robot apocalypse might be tempered a little bit,” he said.

Eight decades years later, “dude, where’s my flying car?” is shorthand for any stuff “they” promised us that we haven’t got.We have always wanted to fly, so, as soon as cars came on to the scene, we wanted those to fly too. Early blueprints for the US interstate highway grid even had adjacent runways ready for flying cars. But those never came. Now that concept of the flying “car” seems quaint or naive, a 20th-century dream fuelled by decades of sci-fi and the Jetsons, as obsolete as the model T. Yet as we’ll see, something just as good may take its place. History teaches us that multi-use vehicles are naff. What is a perfect design for an aircraft is not perfect for a car and vice versa. To try to combine the two is what UK design consultant Peter Stevens calls “an inherent, debilitating compromise” – a lesson learned the hard way.Witness the foolhardy Convair Model 118, (1947) – simply a car with plane wings stuck on top. It was forced kicking and screaming into the air on two occasions, with perilous results. This tortured Frankenstein of a contraption is a super-example of why your local bus isn’t amphibious, and why submarines don’t fly. Yet, few people wouldn’t want a personal, car-like flying vehicle that’s comfortable, convenient and liberating. Helicopters don’t really cut it, nor planes you are allowed to drive on a road, an idea making the rounds ever since the admirable but painfully labour-intensive 1950s AeroCar.It’s generally agreed runways are a no-no in most urban environments, so our “car” needs to be capable of quiet, stable, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). A feat that has proven extremely tricky, as SkyCar veteran Paul Moller has found, “nothing comes down faster than a VTOL vehicle upside down”.At present, that means propellers of some sort, but Dekkard’s ride in Blade Runner didn’t look like a giant drone. Similarly, anything with jets stuck on the wings feels like a plane, and besides, no one wants the noise of a Harrier taking off next door. To top it off, VTOL devours fuel, as in the absence of a new method of levitation, we are still relying on pushing a lot of air downwards. Technical dilemmas aside, in any future where there are flying cars, everyone will want one: motorway pile-ups are bad enough without the horrors of a 3D version. Autonomy might only be granted to police or other emergency vehicles – as in Blade Runner. So you won’t be a pilot, you’ll be a passenger, in a vehicle hooked to a complex GPS system, a frighteningly clever self-driving AI, and a whole new concept of air traffic control. All of which is difficult, but not impossible.The traffic they could soon be controlling might include some of the following, some of which are like a car, some ... less so.Terrefugia’s Transition: Henry Ford’s “combination aeroplane and motor car” encapsulated. The Massachusetts firm says it’s “the world’s first practical flying car ... making that Jetsons dream a reality”. Downsides: the Transition looks like a plane, takes off on a runway and you still need to be a pilot and at an airport to fly it. That’s a plane – albeit one allowed on the road by dint of folding up its wings like a metal bat. For the same price – about £230,000 – you could get a plane and a nice car. Available in 2019.The Pal V-One drives like a souped-up Sinclair C5 on the road, but then laboriously unfurls cumbersome helicopter rotors and yet still needs a runway to take off. Nope.From Slovakia, AeroMobil’s impressive flying car looks the part, with its super-lightweight, carbon-fibre tuck-in-able wings. But it, too, needs a runway, so it can either be used as a car, or as a plane. Great if you live in the outback otherwise, might as well get a car, and a plane. Toyota is working on a fully electric, VTOL, computer-controlled flying car. At present it looks like some hairdryers nailed to a pallet, but don’t bet against Toyota having something spectacular to show off at the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo.Israel’s Urban Aeronautics’ uses a more elegant enclosed rotor system on its wingless, computer-controlled Fancraft: “the classic vision of a flying car” (more a flying hovercraft, perhaps). The Israeli military has already snagged the technology for a rather sinister flying tank it calls the AirMule (for use in “search and rescue” where helicopters would be unsuitable). Easy to imagine the police aerially harassing us with one of these within a decade.Two examples share first prize: Terrefugia’s TF-X – an all-electric, AI-controlled, VTOL vehicle that looks much more like that car in your head, but is sadly 10 years away and the temptingly sleek Lilium Jet – the world’s first VTOL electric jet, according the the German tech firm. Faster than a helicopter, quieter than a Harrier jump jet ... even a bit like a car. Finally, no mention of flying cars must pass without an honourable award for gallantry to Paul Moller and his stylish “volantor” – a VTOL plane-like car that started life in 1965 as a drivable flying saucer. Fifty years later, it is still awaiting investment.It’s probably a matter of when, not if, road-based travel becomes obsolete – the likes of Uber already show the will is finally there and the tech is tantalisingly close.Regulatory hurdles aside, we may see VTOLs flying over our cities very soon ... but whether they will allow you to drive one is another thing.

What we’re missing is a conductor.”Nielsen – who Trump has reportedly criticised in private for failing to tackle border security – told reporters she had not heard the recording.Trump has found himself at the centre of many moral storms since becoming president nearly 18 months ago but they have more often related to words than to actions. The border separations, however, appear to have crossed a new line as the audio recording emerges, as well as harrowing photos of children in tears or in fenced cages, provoking some to draw comparisons with concentration camps.The process has triggered condemnation from four former first ladies: Rosalynn Carter, Laura Bush (who called it “cruel” and “immoral”), Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump. Even the current first lady, Melania Trump, has released a statement saying she “hates to see” children separated from their families.The separations followed the April announcement of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, under which everyone caught crossing the border illegally is to be prosecuted. Consequently, more adults are being jailed, pending trial, and their children are removed from them. Nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their families in the past six weeks.She denied that any children had been mistreated and argued: “This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border ... Parents who entered illegally are by definition criminals ... By entering our country illegally often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants have put their children at risk.”The homeland security department, she continued, was merely enforcing the law in a way that past administrations had failed to do. “Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring the law. We are enforcing the laws as they exist on the books.”Nielsen called on Congress to close loopholes in the law so families could stay together. “Congress and the courts created this problem and Congress alone can fix it. Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States.”John Kelly, the White House chief of staff and Nielsen’s predecessor at homeland security, told National Public Radio in May that deterrence was “a big part” of the policy. Asked if the situation was therefore playing out as intended, Nielsen replied: “I find that offensive.”Nielsen was followed at the podium by the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, who said the White House would reject a narrow fix by Congress to address the issue and that Trump’s priorities, such as funding a border wall and tightening immigration laws, must also be met. She said: “We want to fix the whole thing, we don’t want to tinker with just part of it.”As the issue overwhelmed TV news networks and threatened to cause lasting damage to America’s reputation abroad, Trump himself weighed in at an event ostensibly promoting his National Space Council. He repeated his past attempt to deflect blame to the Democrats, whom he branded “obstructionists”, and urged them to find a legislative solution.“The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” the president said. “It won’t be. If you look at what’s happening in Europe, if you look at what’s happening in other places, we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.”But Democrats rejected that assertion. Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, responded to Nielsen’s remarks by saying: “This utter lack of compassion and respect for basic human dignity is grotesque. And the blind contempt his staff has shown toward anyone pointing out the truth is a vile disgrace. This is not who we are. The American people are watching.”The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and senators Kamala Harris of California and Tina Smith of Minnesota called on Nielsen to resign. Smith said: “She’s denied that this is happening at all, and then said that she ‘wouldn’t apologize’ for what’s happening to families. Kirstjen Nielsen has lost the credibility and the moral authority to lead this agency.” Immigration is usually a rallying point for the Trump base but even some of his supporters have raised objections to the current action. The Rev Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump ally, said: “It’s disgraceful, and it’s terrible to see families ripped apart, and I don’t support that one bit.” Anthony Scaramucci, Trump’s former communications director, told CNN: “I hope he changes it today, frankly. This is very, very bad for the Republican party, and this is bad for the president. I want to see him win re-election.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89413aedd74bf20880740fd9b526995263486712/0_69_4833_2900/master/4833.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd99469170d3f636cca7d5c28f02622a","title":"call me mr president emmanuel macron scolds teenager","story":"Macron told off a teenager during visit to Mont Valerian fort where French resistance members were executedLike most politicians, French President Emmanuel Macron seems to enjoy pressing the flesh and posing for selfies when on public outings.Just don’t call him by a nickname.A cheeky teen who dared greet him with a breezy “How’s it going, Manu” during an official outing near Paris on Monday was left red-faced after receiving a sharp dressing-down from the 40-year-old centrist.“No, you can’t do that, no, no, no, no,” Macron told the youngster who was waiting with a group of schoolfriends to meet him during his visit to the Mont Valerien fort near Paris, where hundreds of French Resistance members were executed during the second world war.“Sorry, Mr President,” the teenager said, looking abashed.Macron told the teen, who had begun by singing a few lines from the Socialist anthem The Internationale – a dig at the president’s pro-business reforms – to “do things in the right order”.“The day you want to start a revolution you study first in order to obtain a degree and feed yourself, ok? And then you can lecture others,” he said.The exchange, which was captured on camera, was widely shared on social media.It comes as Macron – who adopted a regal, top-down style on taking office – himself faces criticism for his at-times blunt language.In an official video shared by his office last week he complained that the French were spending a “crazy amount of dough” on social security.Macron’s critics held the video up as evidence that the man they call the “president of the rich” lacked empathy with the poor.Last year, Macron also raised the hackles of the left by calling protesting opponents of his labour reforms “slackers”.

A similar census pitched by the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was blocked by an Italian court. The row is the first sign of a potentially serious split between Salvini and Di Maio, who has been overshadowed in the first weeks of government and appears eager to rein in the far-right leader. The two parties – Salvini’s League and Di Maio’s M5S – are both populist, but the League has tended to be much more outspoken about its xenophobic and racist attitudes towards migrants and non-Italians.Salvini’s intense focus on immigration and “foreigners” has collided with M5S’s priorities of economic fairness and labour policy. The Roma community has long been a target of Salvini, whose rise to prominence often involved press appearances at Roma camps, which he has frequently threatened to raze.On Monday he ordered the census and the removal of all non-Italian Roma – which he called an “answer to the Roma question” – and said he wanted to know “who, and how many” there were. “Unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we can’t expel them,” Salvini said on Telelombardia.Salvini is on record as having praised Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist leader, and his new policy has sparked comparisons by the centre-left Democratic party to ethnic cleansing rules introduced in the 1930s that also targeted the Roma.Salvini later added to his remarks, saying he did not want to create a separate list of the Roma, and that his intention was to protect Roma children and ensure they were going to school.“The interior minister does not seem to know that a census on the basis of ethnicity is not permitted by the law,” Carlo Stasolla, president of the Associazione 21 Luglio, which supports Roma rights, told the Ansa news agency. “We also recall that Italian Roma have been present in our country for at least half a century and sometimes they are ‘more Italian’ than many of our fellow citizens.”About 4,000 Roma live in state-sanctioned ghettos in Rome, according to a 2013 report by Amnesty International. These out-of-city ghettoes consist of pre-fabricated containers or mobile homes in fenced-off areas, often without adequate sanitationor clean drinking water. Inhabitants are excluded from other social housing despite many having lived in Italy for generations.An Italian court in 2015 ordered the city of Rome to dismantle some of the state-sanctioned Roma facilities, after it said the capital was guilty of ethnic discrimination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50cf4c0e52ecd204d088dc81559d544f8dd30c7d/0_44_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2dba5481c9f3fbc12898be85d5175d7","title":"japanese airlines rename taiwan as china taiwan on websites","story":"Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways now refer to Taiwan as a Chinese territory on Chinese-language websitesJapan’s two largest airlines have changed “Taiwan” to “China Taiwan” on their Chinese-language websites, officials said Tuesday, a move likely to please Beijing but anger the self-ruled island.The change, which was made last week, is meant to accommodate customers, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways said.The description remains “Taiwan” on their websites in Japanese and other languages.Both carriers said they had not received any protest from Taiwan so far, though Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported Taiwan’s foreign ministry would lodge a complaint with the airlines through Japan’s de-facto diplomatic mission in Taipei.“We chose a description that is easy to understand and acceptable for users of our websites,” added the Japan Airlines official, who declined to be named.The change was made on 12 June, the date of the historic summit between North Korea and the United States, but the officials said the events were unconnected.“The change came on June 12 as our preparations were done by then,” he said.A spokesman at All Nippon Airways said the change was intended to make the description “easy to understand and acceptable for customers when they use our websites.”“We do not mean any particular group of customers here but mean all customers,” he said without elaborating further. The airlines are not the only international carriers who have made the change recently, with Australia’s Qantas earlier this month defending its decision to list Taiwan as part of China.The Chinese civil aviation administration sent a notice to 36 foreign airlines in April, asking them to comply with Beijing’s standard of referring to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as Chinese territories.Japan’s ties with China are improving after years of acrimony over historical and territorial issues. Japan has close business ties with Taiwan but has acknowledged the “One China” policy, which describes Taiwan as an integral part of China.Asked about the change, Yoshihide Suga, a top Japanese government spokesman, said Tokyo was “not in favour of government authorities demanding certain measures from private companies based on a specific political stance.”“The government has expressed Japan’s interest in this issue on the Chinese side,” he added.

Niall CarsonPA WireOne of the men removed from a erted Ryanair flight on Saturday for allegedly causing a drunken disturbance on the aircraft has described the airline’s reaction as “a disgrace” and “over the top”.Niall Harrington from Cork said he was one of three men taken off a flight traveling from Dublin to Ibiza on Saturday after it erted to Paris Beauvaisover concerns the crew had about the behaviour of some of a 20-strong group. Mr Harrington told Cork radio station Red FM the three people removed from the flight were part of a 20-person stag party on a flight from Dublin to Ibiza. He said a problem arose when his friend opened small bottle of vodka on the flight. This man was asked by a flight attendant to put it away, which he did, but he took it out later.“There was no disruptive behaviour. It was just good fun.”In a statement Ryanair said a “flight from Dublin to Ibiza (on June 16th) erted to Paris Beauvais after three passengers became disruptive inflight. The aircraft landed normally and the passengers were removed and detained by police upon arrival, before the aircraft continued to Ibiza. We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and the safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. This is now a matter for local police.”Mr Harringtondescribed subsequent reports of drunken misbehaviour by the group on the plane as “fake news”. “It was not like that at all.” Mr Harrington said when he heard the flight had been erted to Beauvais airport he thought it was a joke. He was shocked when French police boarded the flight and took away his friend. Minutes later the police returned for Mr Harrington and another friend who had been sitting with the man who opened the vodka.“Everyone was in total shock. It was pretty intense when the police came on.”He said he heard an air hostess say to the police “get the fat guy with glasses”. This was a reference to one of the other men, not the man who had opened the vodka bottle, who had asked why the others were being taken off the flight, Mr Harrington said.The three men were taken to a room where they were asked for their side of the story. Within an hour they were released and told they could go. The three men then got a taxi to Charles de Gaulle airport at a cost of €140 from where they got a flight to Palma and from there on to Ibiza.They have since been contacted by Ryanair to tell them they are now banned from the airline so they will now have to find a flight on another airline to get home on Tuesday. It is expected the three people removed from the flight will fly to Belfast and then take a coach or train to Cork. Mr Harrington was adamant there was no shouting and no unruly behaviour from the group.“We had a couple of pints at the airport, that was all.” He said the group had travelled from Cork to Dublin at 3am on a coach on which there was no alcohol. “There was no real messing, just people having a laugh among themselves.“Before we knew it the plane had landed and guys were coming up with guns in our faces.“Other people on the flight could not believe what happened. We’ve met some of them here in Ibiza.”He described Ryanair’s reaction as over the top and a disgrace. He said the airline was now trying to justify the fact that they erted the flight.“I asked if it was necessary to do this for one person. But we were guilty by association.”Mr Harrington asked other people on the flight to contact Ryanair to complain about the airline’s reaction. Ryanair responded yesterday by calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, such as a two-drink limit per passenger and no alcohol sales before 10am.The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has described the Ryanair’s suggestion of restrictions on the sale of alcohol at airports during he morning as “highly draconian”.“The behaviour of some iniduals on the Ryanair flight in question was clearly unacceptable,” a spokeswoman for the DAA said on Monday. She pointed out that Dublin Airport had “worked in the past with Ryanair and other airlines, the Irish Aviation Authority, the gardaí and airport police on a joint education campaign to stress that such behaviour in totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated at the airport”.The spokeswoman said the airport would continue to work “with its airline customers and all other agencies in relation to this issue and will again remind the licence holders in its bars and restaurants of their responsibilities in this area”.However, she said Ryanair’s suggested response was “a highly draconian one that would affect all passengers because of the behaviour of a very, very small minority of airline travellers”. Ryanair’s chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, has said the airline might consider not selling alcohol on flights before 10am.Mr Jacobs told RTÉ’s News at One he believed alcohol was involved in the incident, but said it was rare that a flight had to be erted. He said not only were the remaining passengers on board the original flight delayed and inconvenienced, but so too were 180 passengers in Ibiza awaiting a return flight.He called on the DAA to introduce a system where people have to show their boarding pass to buy alcohol (as with duty free purchases), with a limit of two drinks. This would require only a small amount of effort, and he felt that the vast majority of people would be happy with such an arrangement.

Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesTwo out of three British voters who backed Brexit would prefer to see a hard border in Ireland than for Britain to remain in the EU customs union, according to a new poll.Only one in three British voters said they could not accept a different status for Northern Ireland after Brexit and six out of 10 Leave voters said that leaving the EU was more important than keeping the United Kingdom together.The poll by Conservative peer Michael Ashcroft found that, given a straight choice between a hard border and remaining in the customs union, 41 per cent of all voters would choose a hard border compared to 32 per cent who would remain in the customs union. Leave voters would choose a hard border by 66 per cent to 10 per cent and Conservative voters would make the same choice by 67 per cent to 14 per cent.Remain voters would stay in the customs union rather than see a hard border by 55 per cent to 21 per cent and Labour voters would make the same choice by 47 per cent to 25 per cent.More than nine out of 10 unionists in Northern Ireland, and three out of four Conservatives in Britain, agreed that the Border issue is being “deliberately exaggerated by politicians and others to suit their own political agenda.”Writing in the Daily , Lord Ashcroft said that most British voters thought Brexit was taking too long, with Leave voters often blaming those who want to soften or delay Britain’s exit from the EU.“Given these views - impatience with the process, determination for the UK to operate an independent trade policy, and the suspicion that Brexit opponents are deliberately throwing up hurdles - it is not hard to imagine how Leave voters would react if told the UK would not be taking back as much control as they hoped because of the Irish border, an issue they believe is being blown out of proportion,” he wrote.Only one in three voters in Britain said it would be completely unacceptable for Northern Ireland to have a different status in the EU from England, Scotland and Wales. Three in 10 said such an outcome “would not be ideal, but would be acceptable as part of a deal to get a sensible Brexit arrangement”. And most British voters said that they did not have a view about whether Northern Ireland should remain in the UK, saying it was for the people there to decide.Lord Ashcroft’s poll found that, asked to choose between keeping the UK together and leaving the EU, 63 per cent of British voters would leave the EU, compared with 27 per cent who would keep the UK together. Among Conservative voters, 73 per cent would choose leaving the EU with just 22 per cent saying they would keep the UK together. Labour voters would choose leaving the EU over keeping the UK together by 50 per cent to 34 per cent.“Those who have pondered Brexit’s consequences for UK union have usually focused on the resentment felt in places where majorities voted to remain in the EU,” Lord Ashcroft wrote.“But there is another risk: that a question like the Irish border, which most Leave voters see as a relatively minor practical issue that could be resolved, should prevent the majority getting the Brexit they think they voted for.”Lord Ashcroft conducted separate polls with 3,294 voters in Britain, 1,666 in Northern Ireland and 1,500 in the Republic, along with focus groups in a number of towns and cities.A majority of voters in Northern Ireland said they thought Brexit had made Irish unification in the foreseeable future more likely, a view shared by just four in 10 in the Republic. Asked how they would vote if there was a border poll tomorrow, 49 per cent of voters in Northern Ireland said they would vote to stay in the UK, while 44 per cent would vote for a united Ireland.In the Republic, 35 per cent of voters said they would like to see a united Ireland in the next few years but 56 per cent said it would not be practical or affordable in the immediate future.Voters in Northern Ireland were more pessimistic about their own future than they were when they looked across the Border at the Republic. 64 per cent said Northern Ireland was on the wrong track, compared to 25 per cent who thought it was on the right track. But 55 per cent of those in Northern Ireland said the Republic was on the right track, compared to 35 per cent who said it was on the wrong track.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

His facial expressions remain permanently blank, he never speaks a word, and he is always alone. Excited viewers have also been treated to exclusive footage that shows him drinking from a mug, eating noodles from a bowl and brushing his teeth. A silent gym workout was an instant viral hit. The Bot-No-Jaem YouTube channel, which means “a robot which is no fun” has defied entertainment norms to become an internet sensation, with over 320,000 subscribers tuning in to watch the student’s mundane daily activities. One video – “study with me” - in which he livestreams a seven hour study session in a bland room with white window blinds, while sitting in a black office chair, received almost 500,000 views.Bot-No-Jaem’s 1-7 hours-long livestreaming sessions include adjusting his glasses and occasionally turning a page on a book“I’ve never seen such an interesting video in my entire life,” said one viewer who, it is presumed, was joking. Bot-No-Jaem, whose real name and age is yet to be revealed, is said to be preparing for a state exam to become a police officer, reported the Korea Herald.   The addiction to his brooding study videos has been attributed in part to his flawless complexion and youthful good looks, which have been compared to boyband stars in the highly popular K-pop scene.His enigmatic appearances have left many female fans gushing over his “gorgeous” face.“My precious time being wasted because I can’t stop watching him,” said one mesmerised fan.  “Excuse me but are you allowed to do this to my heart?” said another lovestruck viewer. Many speculating about what his voice might sound like were given an answer when he recently broke his silence on TV shows including “Morning Wide” on SBS, whose producers were intrigued by his skyrocketing fame.  He said that he began to film himself to stay focussed while studying and explained that the first word “Bot” came from his old nickname “Robot”, which he picked up during military service. He expressed surprise at his fame and thanked his fans for their “love and support.”However, the popular YouTuber has also come under fire from internet surfers who are angry about his easy path to fame, reported Koreaboo. Some have pointed out that female YouTubers have to work much harder to get views, while editing and considering personal attacks and threats. “Meanwhile, this guy just rolls the camera and studies, which is only beneficial for himself, and gains a hardcore fandom,” said one critic.   “Sometimes I really hate the modern world,” added an unimpressed viewer on Reddit. Please review our commenting policyAiden McAnespie: Soldier to face prosecution over fatal shooting at Army checkpoint in Northern IrelandWhen is the summer solstice?

To make matters worse much of the remaining water is badly contaminated by industrial effluents and sewage that seep into the ground.  The report said that climate change, deficient rainfall, the onset of early and extended summer and rising populations across India were collectively making it impossible for urban municipalities to meet rising water demands.A taste of what is to come surfaced last month in the former colonial summer capital Shimla, where the mountain springs sustaining the picturesque Himalayan town simply ran dry.This forced thousands of thirsty and unwashed tourists, who had flocked to the hill retreat to escape the searing heat of the plains, to flee the resort.Hotels were forced to shut down and some 200,000 irascible Shimla residents stood for days in interminable queues to collect merely a just a bucket full of water from government tankers.Officials blamed the crisis on a dry winter, claiming that the mountains had recorded low snowfall in winter.But despite the impending water crisis, many of Delhi’s 20 million residents were unmindful of the impending drought and continued to hose down their cars, water their gardens and let their water tanks overflow.“It’s the governments job to find the water and mine to use it” said Shakuntla Devi. It’s the same story of water shortages each summer, which are resolved with the onset of monsoon rains in July, she optimistically added.Nearly 163 million of India’s population of 1.3 billion people lacked access to clean water close to their homes, the largest such number of any country according to a recent report by the UK-based charity WaterAid.Another 200,000 Indians died each year after drinking contaminated water. Most Indian cities are reliant largely on ground water with some coming from rivers, canals and dams. Efforts to reduce this dependency via varied means through rain harvesting and linking rivers have failed.Please review our commenting policyVideo: Drone finds 75-year-old man who got stuck in marshes after going on a walk with friendsFirst footage from inside Grenfell Tower fire shown to inquiryAiden McAnespie: Soldier to face prosecution over fatal shooting at Army checkpoint in Northern IrelandWhen is the summer solstice?

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1723 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system.

How did they survive up here?”2323 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Chlorophyll-a is present in all plants, as well as algae and photosynthetic bacteria, and scientists long assumed that there was a “red limit” on photosynthesis.Astrobiologists have used this supposed limit to gauge whether complex life could be evolving on distant planets in other solar systems.However, some photosynthetic bacteria known as cyanobacteria have another trick up their microscopic sleeves.\u0026nbspResearchers found another form of chlorophyll working in communities of these creatures growing in shaded conditions in “bacterial mats” in Yellowstone National Park and inside rocks found on Australian beaches.In near-infrared light, the chlorophyll-a systems of these bacteria shut down and a different variety – chlorophyll-f – begins operating in lower energy conditions “beyond the red limit”.Junk food-loving bacteria, not extra weight, cause arthritisProfessor Rutherford and his team tested these abilities by placing cyanobacteria communities into cupboards fitted with infrared LEDs.“Finding a type of photosynthesis that works beyond the red limit changes our understanding of the energy requirements of photosynthesis,” said Dr Andrea Fantuzzi, co-author of the study that was published in the journal Science.“This provides insights into light energy use and into mechanisms that protect the systems against damage by light.”Besides broadening the search for aliens, the discovery could help scientists genetically engineer crops that can survive in a wider range of light conditions.Dr Dennis Nurnberg, the first author of the study, said: “I did not expect that my interest in cyanobacteria and their erse lifestyles would snowball into a major change in how we understand photosynthesis.\u0026nbsp“It is amazing what is still out there in nature waiting to be discovered.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Every one of us can think of a local public building or outside space we love and use – from libraries to lidos and town halls to youth centres.“Many hundreds of local community groups are stepping up and fighting for community ownership, but they urgently need support and help with startup costs if they are to compete with the commercial developers.”Airbnb\u0027s European headquarters in Dublin won best office interior.

We want to see community ownership prioritised.“Selling these buildings and spaces on the open-market to the highest bidder means they are often lost to the community forever, and that the deeper value to local people will never be realised.“In these circumstances the community have no real influence over what the space will be used for, and so-called ‘fire sales’ of public assets to remote private owners can mean empty, boarded-up properties, which can lead to social, economic and environmental decline.”Councils face ‘decades more austerity’ amid social care costsVulnerable children ‘paying the price of Tory austerity’Councils at financial breaking point due to austerity warns NAOThe report added: “It is often the poorest places that are most reliant on these types of spaces. Losing them can have a devastating impact on local people and communities. Years of austerity and lack of investment have decimated local services and left many of the places people rely on shuttered up, under threat or falling into disrepair.”In calling for national government money to help keep local buildings and spaces in community ownership, the charity stressed: “This isn’t about buildings of historical or architectural value, although many of them are, and it isn’t about protecting green space for the sake of it.\u0026nbsp“This is about people – all of us – and our local communities. These buildings and spaces are often at the heart of the community, where local people meet, access services and find support. They are where we can connect with our neighbours, give help and be supported by others, and where we can come together to shape our own areas.\u0026nbsp“They are spaces where everyone belongs and where lives are transformed.”\u0026nbspA spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said:\u0026nbsp“Councils will have £90.7bn to spend on local services over the next two years.“They are responsible for managing their own finances and making the right decisions for the communities they serve.“All local authorities must properly consider the risks and opportunities before making commercial decisions.“We are working with local government to develop a funding system for the future based on the needs of different areas.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It can range from seeing a child wearing the same shirt for a few days, or noticing that they haven’t washed when they get changed for PE. We won’t stand by if we know people are in need,” she said.“It’s not always an impact on families that are on benefits – it can be self-employed families or those made redundant. More and more households are falling on hard times.“It’s becoming part of my year on year budgets. We try to look at the budget very carefully to put that money aside to allocate towards these products. Staff are even buying extra bits to distribute it to families when they go shopping.“I didn’t come into the profession to see children suffer.

Responding to the findings, Dr Richard Woolfson, a child psychologist, said: “Children’s self-esteem is greatly affected by the reaction of those around them – and if they are stigmatised, ridiculed or rejected by their peers because of poor basic hygiene, their sense of self-worth will quickly nose-e.\u0026nbsp“That’s why hygiene poverty has such a devastatingly negative effect on a child’s psychological development, not just on their health but also on their confidence, self-esteem, social relationships and class work.”Government figures published earlier this year\u0026nbspshowed the number of children in poverty across the UK had surged by 100,000 in 12 months, with 4.1 million children\u0026nbspliving in relative poverty after household costs -\u0026nbspthe worst figures since the financial crisis.A Government spokesman said: “We want all children to have the very best chances in life. We know that the best route out of poverty is through employment, and since 2010 an extra three million people are now in work and 300,000 fewer children are living in absolute poverty. Meanwhile, we spend around £90bn a year on working-age benefits, including for those on low incomes.“We continue to support the country’s most disadvantaged children through free school meals. Additionally, £2.5billion funding is given to schools through the Pupil Premium to support their education.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

While thousands were asked to come to UK to help rebuild after the war, the Home Office is showing them nothing but disdain when they are heroes. I want this government to show respect for those who helped the UK off its knees and an amnesty for the Windrush generation, whichever country they are from.”\u0026nbspIn one case, 73-year-old Indian grandmother Raj Rani Bhanote, who has lived in the UK for 55 years, was stranded in the US for four days after being blocked from boarding a plane back to Britain.Ms\u0026nbspBhanote was questioned by British Airways check-in staff as she tried to board a flight from Arizona after visiting relatives. They claimed not to recognise the stamp on her Indian passport, designed to prove her right to remain in the UK.Staff contacted the Home Office, which claimed she was not a British resident, and she was not allowed to board the aircraft. It took four days for the government’s\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce to intervene so she could return home.\u0026nbspMs Bhanote, who has three children and four grandchildren in the UK and worked as a\u0026nbsppost office assistant, told The Independent she felt “terrible”, adding: “I spoke to someone on the phone who refused to speak to my family and could not understand why they were behaving in such a disrespectful manner towards me.”Her son,\u0026nbspArun\u0026nbspBhanote, has since written to his MP to request an investigation by the Home Office into what he described as “racist maladministration and xenophobic calamity”.Satbir\u0026nbspSingh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said the case was a “disturbing but sadly all-too-common occurrence”.“Cases like this show just how incredibly complicated, rigid and inhumane our immigration system has become,” he said.\u0026nbsp“It’s a relief that the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce was able to help in this case, but it also shows the need for such remedies to be available to everybody who faces poor decision-making either at the Home Office or at the border.”It comes as the government announced that a\u0026nbspday celebrating the Windrush generation and their descendants was\u0026nbspto be held annually, after it emerged a large number of\u0026nbspBritish\u0026nbspCaribbean\u0026nbspnationals had been wrongly targeted by immigration officials in the UK.But Alessandra\u0026nbspSciarra, from Lewisham Refugee and Migrant Network, which supports migrants and refugees in south London, said they had seen at least a dozen cases of non-Caribbean Commonwealth citizens encountering\u0026nbspsimilar issues\u0026nbspin the past six months.“They extend to people from different countries it’s much more widespread.\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspis just the tip of the iceberg,” she said.Ms Sciarra\u0026nbspsaid one of their cases involved a 65-year-old Indian man who was born in Uganda and became a British protected person after fleeing persecution to the UK in 1972.\u0026nbspDespite living here since, working and building a family, and never encountering any issues with his immigration status, he has recently been unable to find work due to issues with his documents.“In the 46 years he has been living in the UK, he has integrated successfully into his community in Lewisham. His wife and adult children were all recognised as British citizens,” she\u0026nbspsaid.“But recently Mr Khan lost his job and began looking for employment again just prior to retirement. He faced numerous issues in this process, as many employers asked him for a proof of his right to reside and work in the country.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said one of her constituents, of Ghanaian descent who has been in Britain for over 50 years, had recently contacted her after had been threatened with deportation.The Labour MP said: “The Windrush scandal goes way beyond the people that stepped off Empire Windrush or even all those from the Caribbean. Everyone from the Commonwealth who came here before 1973 could get caught up in the scandal, including deportation or detention.“These are not isolated mistakes. They are a product of the government’s ‘hostile environment’ policy, and Theresa May’s instruction to ‘deport first, appeal later’. Until these end, the scandal will not go away.”The Home Office declined to disclose the exact number of non-Caribbean cases​​ the taskforce was dealing with.Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said his office received on average three cases a week – or around 150 a year – from Indian nationals who have lived in the UK for more than a decade but are now denied their rights and in some cases threatened with deportation.“It is not just Windrush cases,” he said.\u0026nbsp“There is a systemic failure on the part of the Home Office to deal with cases promptly. Delay is being used as a substitute for decision-making.“There are a lot of people who are from India who have been in this country for 20 years, but are being held in a long queue being made to sign on and\u0026nbspcannot work, but are actually entitled to stay here.“As a result, people can stay for a very long time – as long as 20 years – and still not know precisely where they stand. Some inevitably\u0026nbspget removed without anyone intervening. They live in a subculture of society\u0026nbspand so are reluctant to come forward, but actually they do have the right to stay.”Mr Vaz raised concerns that the Home Office had “erted resources” from dealing with immigration cases from the Indian subcontinent in order to set up the Windrush\u0026nbsptaskforce.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

South Korea and the Pentagon announced they would halt the annual Freedom  military drill scheduled for August.In an unusual move, Chinese state media announced Kim\u0027s visit and said he would stay for two days. Previously China would only confirm Kim had visited after he had left the country. No other details were provided.A Kim trip to China to discuss his summit with Trump had been widely anticipated in diplomatic circles. China is North Korea\u0027s most important diplomatic and economic backer but has been angered by Pyongyang\u0027s nuclear and missile tests.Police tightened security along Beijing\u0027s main Changan Avenue, which leads to the Great Hall of the People where Chinese leaders normally meet visiting heads of state, and also outside the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where Kim stayed with his wife during his March visit to Beijing.Outside the east gate of the Great Hall, where foreign leaders are officially welcomed, authorities had erected a screen running the full length of the road, cutting off the view behind it.China has welcomed the warming of ties between Washington and Pyongyang, and offered to help.Beijing has been particularly pleased by Trump\u0027s announcement to suspend military drills, which China has long pushed for under its dual suspension proposal, whereby North Korea stops weapons tests and the United States and South Korea stop military drills, so both sides can sit down for talks.South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend all planning activities regarding the Freedom  military drill scheduled for August, according to a South Korean defence ministry statement.A Pentagon statement confirmed the suspension and added that there would be a meeting between the secretaries of defence and state as well as Trump\u0027s national security adviser on the issue this week.North and South Korea agree to joint teams for Asian GamesUS and South Korea \u0027poised to halt war games within days\u0027Asia\u0027s fine balance of military power is about to change completelyTrump salutes North Korea general in exchange aired on state televisonMike Pompeo says no sanctions relief until North Korea denuclearises Last year, 17,500 American and more than 50,000 South Korean troops participated in the Ulchi Freedom  drills, although the exercise is mostly focused on computerized simulations rather than live field exercises that use weapons, tanks or aircraft.The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every spring with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month.The decision to halt military exercises in South Korea has bewildered many current and former U.S. defence officials, who only learned about it when Trump made his remarks after the Singapore meeting.Japan\u0027s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday there would be no changes to joint drill plans between the United States and Japan, both of which also engage in regular deterrence exercises against North Korea.The United States is in a position to keep its commitment to its allied nations\u0027 defence and our understanding is there is no change to the U.S. commitment to the Japan-U.S. alliance and the structure of American troops stationed in Japan, Suga said in a regular briefing.The Pentagon has yet to publicly release the cost of previous and future joint military exercises with South Korea, a week after Trump cited their tremendously expensive cost as a reason for halting them.Spending data for previous military exercises in Korea and elsewhere, however, suggest that the cost of a single exercise would be in the low or perhaps tens of millions of dollars in a U.S. military budget this year of nearly $700 billion.In response to repeated requests for cost data, Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, said: We are currently evaluating the costs of the exercises.Calculating the cost of military exercises is a complicated process, often requiring data from different branches of the military and spread over several budgets over different years.Troops who would have been involved in the exercises would still require training and certification, which would still cost money, said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia under President Barack Obama.To me, the idea of this as a cost saving measure doesn\u0027t really make much sense, Denmark said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added that the dossier would involve a “census of Roma in Italy” which would “see who, how, how many”. He added: “Unfortunately, you need to keep Italian Roma in Italy.”The country\u0026nbspis estimated to be home to between 100,000 and 180,000 Roma.The minister’s actions drew criticism from human rights groups and opposition politicians.“The way is short from a census to a concentration camp. Salvini apparently decided to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the racial laws,” Chiara Gribaudo, a deputy from the centre-left Democratic Party said, referencing the Mussolini era.The way is short from a census to a concentration camp“The interior minister does not seem to know that a census on the basis of ethnicity is not permitted by law,” said Carlo Stasolla, president of\u0026nbspAssociazione 21 Luglio, a group that\u0026nbspcampaigns for\u0026nbspRoma\u0026nbsprights.Responding to anger at his comments, the minister tweeted: “Someone is talking about being shocked. Why? I am thinking of those poor children taught to steal and break laws.”Roma have faced active persecution in Europe for centuries hundreds of thousands were killed in a genocide by Nazi Germany, amounting to between a quarter and half of the population.The formation of the new Italian government has seen the country take an anti-foreigner turn across policy areas.

Combined, they make up one in every 110 people on the planet.Just over 16.2 million were freshly forced from their homes in 2017 alone, meaning that a new person became displaced every two seconds. And the number of asylum-seekers, trapped in limbo awaiting the outcome of their claims, rose above 3 million.But the global scale of the problem is not being matched by an international response, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi.Refugee children abused and illegally returned at France-Italy borderRohingya facing ‘crisis on top of crisis’ as world looks other wayMyanmar says it is willing to take back all Rohingya refugeesSyria’s new housing law will displace tens of thousands of refugeesPolice clear migrants from biggest illegal camp in ParisHungary considering making offering food to refugees illegalVast numbers of refugees are living in just a handful of countries closest to conflict zones, with the likes of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Uganda and Bangladesh taking people in at far higher rates than the global average.“We are at a watershed, where success in managing forced displacement globally requires a new and far more comprehensive approach so that countries and communities aren’t left dealing with this alone,” Mr Grandi said.Mr Grandi also highlighted the helplessness of those who had “no choice” but to flee their homes. Of the global displaced population, a staggering 53 per cent are children. Their number, the UN said, includes many who are unaccompanied or separated from their families.And among the specific case studies highlighted by the report were the Rohingya, 655,000 of whom fled Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh in the space of just three months from late August 2017.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspA senior UN official has previously described violence towards the Rohingya by the Myanmar army as a “textbook case of ethnic cleansing”. The government of Myanmar has for generations refused to acknowledge the Muslim minority’s right to citizenship in northern Rakhine state, insisting they are illegal immigrants from neighbouring states.“Nowhere is the link between statelessness and displacement more evident than for the Rohingya community of Myanmar, for whom denial of citizenship is a key aspect of the entrenched discrimination and exclusion that have shaped their plight for decades,” Mr Grandi said.Life in a Palestinian refugee campAhmed Nabeel, 19, was born in the camp and now works as a welderThree boys sit on a wall watching what is going on in the campPiles of rubbish are a direct result of US president Donald Trump cutting funds to UNRWAA young girl runs down one of the main streets to the marketplaceA boy pretends his cigarette cards are Jordanian dinar Mohammed Saeed, 12, helps the elderly cart their shopping back to their homesUnrest in the camp, where many are living below the poverty lineAlleyways where waste is left attract rats and cause illnessIbrahim Bassam, 11, spends his time playing with friends in mounds of rubbishMuhand Salem, 22, a university student studying mechanical engineering, one of very few scholarships available to refugeesNabeel Salem, 62, arrived in the camp at the age of 12 and still recalls his father telling him not to pack too many of his clothes and toys because they wouldn’t be there longAhmed Nabeel, 19, was born in the camp and now works as a welderThree boys sit on a wall watching what is going on in the campPiles of rubbish are a direct result of US president Donald Trump cutting funds to UNRWAA young girl runs down one of the main streets to the marketplaceA boy pretends his cigarette cards are Jordanian dinar Mohammed Saeed, 12, helps the elderly cart their shopping back to their homesUnrest in the camp, where many are living below the poverty lineAlleyways where waste is left attract rats and cause illnessIbrahim Bassam, 11, spends his time playing with friends in mounds of rubbishMuhand Salem, 22, a university student studying mechanical engineering, one of very few scholarships available to refugeesNabeel Salem, 62, arrived in the camp at the age of 12 and still recalls his father telling him not to pack too many of his clothes and toys because they wouldn’t be there longThe UN report does conclude with what Mr Grandi calls a “reason for some hope”, however, pointing towards a shared agreement currently being drafted by the UN in response to the global refugee crises. Dubbed the Global Compact on Refugees, it would see displaced people resettled more equitably and put in place basic standards for things like healthcare access from the moment refugees cross into another country.“Today, on the eve of World Refugee Day, my message to member states is please support this,” Mr Grandi said. “No one becomes a refugee by choice but the rest of us can have a choice about how we help.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky.

meaning thousands of stressed students are likely to be disappointed with their actual results.This years guinea pig set of youngsters have been tasked with tackling new exams for many subjects.Some revisions came in last year, after a host of reforms from former Education Secretary Michael Gove aimed to toughen up the syllabuses, and 17 more subjects have been changed for this summer.Coursework has been largely done away with for many subjects and the grading changed to be deliberately challenging - with a new 9 to 1 grade system.This was to allow for easier differentiation between stronger and weaker pupils, cut the number of students getting A*s and to streamline the courses.Subjects that have been tweaked include science, geography, history and some languages.But for the thousands of schoolkids across the country, it has just made the exams harder and the amount of papers they have to sit skyrocket.Teachers have reported they feel they have to cover a huge amount of content for the reformed GCSEs, and pupils have complained they feel the pressure more than ever.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the : I think it’s fair to say there is quite a lot of anxiety from young people – they feel as though they are guinea pigs in a new system.“With the new grading system, there is a danger of this being of a lottery when it used to be an expertise.“They haven’t got the backlog of past papers and mark schemes and all those other things to hone their skills and advise students.”Tougher GCSEs are now graded from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest mark.Coursework and assessment on a module by module basis have been replaced by end of course exams that contain much more challenging content.The exams have been designed to bring England into line with top-performing systems in the Far East and identify academic high-fliers for top universities.They were introduced following a damning 2013 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.It found England was the only country in the developed world in which adults aged 55 to 65 performed better in literacy and numeracy than those aged 16 to 24. Ofqual, the exams watchdog, said the reforms were designed to raise standards and stay in line with what universities and employers will expect.But some subjects, like the Computer Science GCSE, which replaces Information and Communication Technology, is so much harder pupils are being put off.A report warned the number of girls taking up the subject has dropped, with men from affluent families who are good at maths are most likely to study it.Earlier this month we reported how students were left in floods of tears by this summers GCSE and A-level exams.They have even suffered panic attacks after a shake-up of the system saw some forced to sit over 30 papers.The changes saw 18-year-old vlogger Jade Bowler emerge from her biology A-level in floods of tears.The new exams has seen schools forced to hold early morning revision sessions and some have resorted to sending teachers to anxious pupil’s houses to make sure they turn up, according to The Sunday Times."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414474363-e1529406636182.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dunkirk boat ww2 evacuation restored isle of wight","story":"The 40ft Caretta had already played a role in two wars by the time it was used to help rescue Allied troops from the beaches of Normandy in May and June 1940.Operation Dynamo saw 850 private boats save over 336,000 British and French soldiers who were facing annihilation by Adolf Hitler’s unstoppable German forces who had trapped them in the town.The vessels sailed from Ramsgate in Kent to rescue the troops during a brief halt in the German advance.Aircraft engineer Arron, 39 and 32-year-old Tina French knew little of the craft’s history when they snapped it up after spotting it on eBay.But after spending £1,000 on its restoration they discovered that it had also  served as a river patrol vessel in the Boer War and took part in the troop landings and evacuations at Gallipoli in the First World War.During the restoration Arron found 32 bullet holes in its hull from where it had been riddled with Turkish machine gun fire while grounding on the beach at Gallipoli.In more recent years Caretta was used by a marine biologist but after he died she ended up going to rot in a boatyard in Essex.It’s thought its remarkable history could see it sell for as much as £100,000 over its £60,000 estimate.Arron, from Ryde on the Isle Of Wight, said: We had been looking to buy a little classic boat as a restoration project.I saw Caretta on eBay. The advert didnt list all of her history, it just said she was a bit old and a bit special.It was only later that we discovered her true history.There cant be that many ships that served in three different wars that are still floating today.The Caretta was launched in 1898 as a small armed boat designed to protect British battleships and cruisers at anchor.She was sent to the Boer War as a river patrol boat and was then used in the First World War to land troops on the beaches in France before being sent to Gallipoli as a landing craft.The exact role of Caretta at Dunkirk is not known but there is a photograph of her being towed with about 16 other little ships down the River Thames towards the English Channel.Terry Woodcock, of Unique Auctions of Lincolnshire, which is selling the vessel, said: We have had a lot of interest in it already.”The sale takes place on June 24."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000413616539.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"italy matteo salvini gypsy census roma question register","story":"Matteo Salvini, 45, who is the Federal Secretary of the country’s far right League, said the measure would be done in a bid to expel any non-Italians.The former MEP, known as ‘Il Capitano’ told the TV station Telelombardia: Unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we cant expel them.”Salvini, who heads the right wing, anti-immigration party added: Irregular [undocumented] foreigners will be deported via agreements with other countries.”He said the information would be used to form a “register” of the Roma or gypsy people as the current situation was “chaos”.Salvini said: “I’ve asked the ministry to prepare a dossier on the Roma question in Italy.”In a subsequent statement, Salvini said the government had no intention of setting up a separate archive for the Roma or taking finger prints, but wanted to protect Roma children who were barred from going to local schools by their parents.He added that he wanted to check how European Union funds aimed at helping marginalised communities were being spent.In a tweet, Salvini wrote: “Someone is talking about being shocked. Why? I am thinking of those poor children taught to steal and break laws.”He wrote on his Facebook page earlier today that I dont quit, and added he would put the Italians and their security first.It is not the first time Salvini has hit out at gypsies and has previously called for the camps to be bulldozed and claimed earlier this year the Roma people were “not happy unless they are stealing.”Salvinis comments drew an immediate barrage of criticism, with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) saying his call revived memories of ethnic cleansing.Roberto Malini, from the charity EveryOne Group, who campaign for minority group rights compared to the move to Nazi propaganda.He said: “These words, and the call for a register of gypsies, takes us back to the beginnings of Nazism.”Carlo Stasolla, of the July 21 Association, which supports Roma rights said: “The Interior Minister apparently doesn’t know that in Italy a census based on ethnic origin is not legal.”In the 13th and 14th centuries in the principalities of what was Moldavia and Wallachia they were classified as slaves.Spain conducted The Great Roundup of Romani in 1749 with the crown ordering a nationwide raid with able-bodied men interned in labour camps in an attempt of ethnic cleansing.Many European countries also followed a policy of forced assimilation with a number of measures including forcing boys into military service, forcing Roma to register with their local authority, banning marriages and even prohibiting wearing their traditional clothing or speaking their language.Norway in 1896 passed a law permitting the state to remove children from their parents and place them in state institutions with around 1,500 Roma children being removed from their parents.Persecution of the Roma worsened even further in Nazi Germany with gypsies subjected to genocide by Germany and its allies during World War 2, such as Benito Mussolini’s Italy.During the Romani Holocaust, known as Porajmos, gypsies were classified as “enemies of the race-based state” and rounded up and taken to the extermination camps.Along with the Jews, gypsies were also used as human subjects in often horrific experiments.The policy was extended to areas occupied by the Nazis during the war, and it was also applied by their allies, notably Croatia, Romania and Hungary.Estimates vary as to how many Roma were victims of the Holocaust with numbers possibly exceeding one million.Sybil Milton, formerly senior historian of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has estimated the figure to be between 220,000 and 500,000.Tens of thousands of Roma, live across Italy, many in squalid shantytowns on the outskirts of major cities.Malini estimated there were around 70,000 Italian Roma in the country with between 30-40,000 non-Italian Roma, mainly from Romania.The country has 30 official camps along with around 30 more that are unlicensed.Salvini is part of a new populist coalition government that is in power with the anti-euro Five Star party which has called for the closure of the unlicensed camps and for the Roma children whose parents do not send them to school to be taken into care.In this year’s general election no one party won an outright majority with both the League and the Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, emerging as strong political forces as the country lurched away from Matteo Renzi’s centre-left coalition.With no party able to form a stable government there followed months of protracted negotiations to find a solution.The new government was finally sworn in on June 1 and has started pursuing a populist, right wing agenda.It has already promised to deport hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants and stopping boats carrying rescued migrants from docking in Italian ports.Salvini recently prevented the ship Aquarius which was carrying 629 migrants from landing in Italy, forcing it to eventually dock in Valencia, Spain."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004132975582-e1529084313308.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rapport with her majesty gives meghan markle last laugh on critics","story":"Photos of her with the Queen this week showed the two of them getting along like a house on fire.It was clear Her Maj has a lot of time and affection for the newest member of the clan and she went out of her way to make Meghan feel at ease.It was very much a royal masterclass from the Queen to her young apprentice, and Meghan appeared to pass all of the tests with flying colours.It must have been intimidating for the newly minted Duchess to find herself carrying out a royal engagement for the first time with the woman she can now call “granny” without Harry by her side.There was a bit of a faux pas when the Queen had to briskly usher her grand-daughter-in-law into the limo when Meghan appeared to be unsure of ­protocol.The Queen then took her ­preferred seat behind the driver. These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The boy, who appears to be in his mid teens, was filmed shouting You all right, Manu? at the visibly irritated politician. The embarrassing encounter took place as the 40-year-old head of state took part in a solemn ceremony commemorating his country’s call to arms during the Second World War. It contrasts sharply with a more relaxed approach taken by international politicians, including British prime ministers and American heads of state, who are regularly addressed by their first names, and even nicknames.  Mr Macron was shaking hands with a group of youngsters across a metal barrier when the teenager used the relaxed greeting, shortening Emmanuel to ‘Manu’. No, no, no, no, no,’ Mr Macron replied. ‘You’re there, you’re at an official ceremony, you conduct yourself in the proper way. You can play the idiot, but today it’s all about the Marseillaise [the National Anthem] and the Song of the Partisans [A song about the French Resistance]  You call me the President of the Republic, or Sir. The unidentified student immediately replies Yes, Sir’, to which Mr Macron says: There, that’s good. Mr Macron then said: And you all do everything in the right order. The day you want to revolt, you know first of all that you have a diploma and you know how to feed yourself, alright? And then it’s you who’ll be giving the lessons.  In 2006, the then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said: Lots of people call me Dave, my mum calls me David, my wife calls me Dave, I don’t really notice what people call me.   Heads of state such as American president Donald Trump are also known for referring to themselves by their first name. The Macron incident took place on Monday at Mont Valerien, a fortress in the Paris suburbs used by the Nazis as a prison and execution site during the wartime occupation of the French capital. It is now a national memorial to the French Resistance after being consecrated by General Charles de Gaulle in 1945. It was De Gaulle who, on June 18 1940, made his famous Appeal speech from London, calling on the French people to rise up against the Germans.

Some of the greatest minds in the country were seen stumbling through the streets and others stripped off and went for a dip in the river at annual end of year blow-out. Hordes of revellers were seen making their way home through the cobbled streets, champagne bottles still in hand, after students from the university\u0027s Trinity and Jesus Colleges held their May Balls. Some of them emerged from the two events , headlined by the likes of pop bands Scouting For Girls and Jonas Blue, still clad in dinner jackets, top hats and glamorous floor-length dresses and prepared to carry on the celebrations with punt rides on the River Cam.  Partygoers threw their lavish ball gowns and tuxedos aside as they hopped into inflatable dinghies and punts, while others were seen frolicking about in the water. Many ladies had ditched heir heels and one was even given a ride home on her male pal\u0027s shoulders as he smoked on a cigar.t. Others messed around in the street, posing for the time-honoured \u0027survivor photo,\u0027 and play pushing their friends to the side - with some unsteady revellers even falling to the ground. Around 1,800 students started the night feasting on a lavish five-course meal and quaffing champagne, before they were treated to music and dancing at the ball, which is held on the first Monday of May Week.  The May Ball events are some of the most lavish events on the university\u0027s calendar. Budgets typically run into the hundreds of thousands of pounds, and their extravagance can stretch as far as balloon rides and artificial canals for punting. Two-person tickets to a college\u0027s end of year bash can cost as much as \u0026pound410 this year, the first time standard-priced tickets for any college ball have broken the \u0026pound200-per-person mark. The ball has been held every year apart from 1910 when King Edward VII died and between 1939 and 1945 during the Second World War.  The celebrations come just days after students piled into boats and floated down the River Cam in the annual jaunt which is known as Suicide Sunday. Not bothered by the comparatively chilly 18 degree temperatures, the students raced each other down the river with some falling into the water. The aim was to row from Jesus Green to Magdalene Bridge but many of them ended up being plunged into the cold waters.

She said: “We went down to Swansea Bay on Sunday in the early evening around five or six o’clock, and the beach was deserted. “There were four kids running around, my three and our friend’s.

Legally, all prepackaged food must display nutritional information about the calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein and salt it contains. But we found that some values listed on products are based on tiny portion sizes that are a just small percentage of the full packet. The worst example we found was a 50g bag of flatbread thin bites at Aldi. The pack reads: “What a treat – just 13 calories per serving.”  But this is per crisp rather than the whole bag, which contains 260 calories, 20 times more than one crisp. Campaigners are calling on retailers to print clearer information on food labels. Martyn James, of the consumer website Resolver, said: “Misleading people about the health benefits of their food isn’t just a betrayal of trust, it’s potentially damaging their health.” The British Retail Consortium said: “Retailers use front of pack labelling to ensure consumers can make informed decisions.” So, how much of these foods should you be eating?  Pack size 70g Number of recommended servings 3 Calories per serving 143 Calories per pack 429  The same size as a bag of crisps, this triple-cooked pork crackling doesn’t seem that unhealthy at just 143 calories per serving and just 3.8g of saturated fat. But Mr Porky claims that the pack contains three servings, so total calories shoot up to 429 calories and 11.4g of saturated fat for the lot.  Innocent orange juice with bits Pack size 330ml  Number of recommended  servings 2.2  Calories per serving 59 Calories per pack 129  Watch for portion sizes when it comes to fruit juice. We shouldn’t be drinking more than 150ml of fruit juice a day due to the high sugar content, yet this small bottle contains over two servings and a total of 26.4g of sugar.  Rowntree’s Fruit Pastilles  Pack size 52.5g Number of recommended servings 2 (7 sweets per serving) Calories per serving 84 Calories per pack 188  Nestle says this pack contains two servings, but how many of us stop at just seven sweets? Sugar goes from 14.9g per serving to 29.8g per pack.  Asda pesto and sun-dried tomato pasta salad Pack size 250g Number of recommended servings 2 Calories per serving 293 Calories per pack 586  The front of the pack says it has 293 calories per portion, but eating the whole box accounts for nearly all of your lunchtime calories. The fat content goes from 18g to 36g with the full box.  Chicago Town stuffed crust sticky sweet cola bbq stuffed crust  Pack size 650g Number of recommended servings 4 Calories per serving 426 Calories per pack 1704  Before chomping down on the whole thing, you might want to examine the small print, as the label gives details for a quarter of the pizza.  Eating it all would exceed a woman’s daily calorie intake. Flatbread Thin bites, cheddar and black pepper Pack size 50g  Number of recommended  servings 20  Calories per serving 13 Calories per pack 260  The Aldi pack reads: “What a treat – just 13 calories per serving”. But this is per crisp, not the full bag, which contains 260 calories.  The Foodie Market Tropical Blend Pack size 70g  Number of recommended  servings 3  Calories per serving 83 Calories per pack 249  Another rather small portion size from Aldi.  A snack pot is designed to be eaten on the go, so why not print calorie content for the whole packet? Twix  Pack size 50g Number of recommended servings 2 Calories per serving 123 Calories per pack 246  Displayed on the front of the gold packaging is a box stating 123 calories.  Only if you bother to turn over to read the small print will you realise that is for just one finger, as manufacturer Mars claims there are two portions in each pack. Kellogg’s Bran Flakes Pack size 750g  Number of recommended  servings 25   Calories per  serving 108  Calories per average 100g serving 359  In reality, 30g of cereal won’t feed a child, let alone an adult. A more realistic breakfast portion size is closer to 100g.  So a serving more likely contains 14g of sugar, not the 4.2g that the front of the pack suggests. Waitrose 1 Milk chocolate bar Pack size 30g Number of recommended servings 6 Calories per serving 31 Calories per pack 186  The “pack contains six servings”, so one portion is a single square, which has 1.7g of sugar. The full bar has 10.2g of sugar.  Asda Fizzy cherry cola flavour bottles  Pack size 45g Number of recommended servings 2 Calories per serving 78 Calories per pack 156  Try telling a child that they can only eat half a bag of sweets. That’s what Asda recommends, and the info on the front of the pack is for a small portion.  Marmite oven baked cashews Pack size 90g  Number of recommended  servings 3   Calories per  serving 172  Calories per pack 516  This bag is supposed to contain three servings. The whole pack has more saturated fat than a Big Mac – 11.5g – or 2.3g per portion.  Smarties  Pack size 38g Number of recommended servings 2 (17 sweets) Calories per serving 96 Calories per pack 192  Another unrealistic portion size from Nestle, which suggests a serving is just 17 sweets – half the pack – or 12.9g of sugar. For those who can’t stop, the full tube contains 25.8g.  Heinz cream of tomato soup Pack size 400g Number of recommended servings 2 Calories per serving 102 Calories per pack 204 Again listed on the front are the nutritional values for just half of the tin despite an adult easily consuming it one sitting. And the whole tin would have you eating 19.4g of sugar compared to 9.7g per portion. Asda chocolate jumbo Swiss roll Pack size 400g  Number of recommended  servings 12  Calories per serving 135 Calories per pack 1620  Get your ruler out, as this is supposed to stretch to 12 servings.

Christian Nade, who used to play for SPL team Hearts, is accused of assaulting Laura Kennedy and subjecting her to domestic abuse while she mourned her grandmother\u0027s death.  The 28-year-old Kennedy told the court he also hit her with a boxed toy car she was due to give a child as a Christmas gift and assaulted her on a third occasion because she threw away a sauce he had made at the flat they shared in Renfrew, reports the Daily Record .  Laura, a skin specialist, rubbished claims she lashed out at Nade on each occasion after finding out he had been cheating on her and that he had actually been acting in self-defence to stop her from hitting him.  Nade, 33, who went on trial at Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday, denies six charges relating to incidents between December last year and March. Laura, niece of Dumbarton assistant manager and former Rangers star Ian Durrant, told the court that Nade first struck her on December 5 after a row about a steak that had been in their fridge for so long it was going green. The blonde mum, who said she was 5ft 7in and weighs 9st, explained: “I went to the police about Christian lifting his hands to me – I wanted to report it. “I remember it was the start of December because my gran had just passed away. “The first time was because I had thrown out food from the fridge and because I never apologised, he hit me. “There was an out-of-date steak in the fridge and I threw it out. “He hit me in the face with the back of his hand.

The man spent several hours on a roof on Saturday morning after residents spotted him looking in their first-floor windows. Once he made a break for it, the homeowner\u0027s son leaped over a six-foot fence and put the man in a headlock.  Other members of the community in Grimsby then marched him back to police, Grimsby Live reported.  Howard Clough said: My wife woke me up to tell me there was someone on our kitchen roof who had been trying the windows. We\u0027ve got some young kids so it was very worrying.  The man, who was described as in his late 20s, refused to come down from the ground-floor roof of the house even after the police arrived. Howard\u0027s son Liam and several other residents gathered around, but the man refused to budge. Residents believe the man had been on another roof on the street at 6am that morning, but that wasn\u0027t reported to police. Someone down the road saw him looking into bedrooms about 6am. One person\u0027s son asked his dad: Why is there a man looking in my window?\u0027 according to Mr Clough. The man\u0027s story allegedly constantly changed - at first, he told residents he was getting a football off the roof and later said he was being chased by six men and couldn\u0027t get down because he was scared. Police arrived on the scene shortly after being alerted to the incident.  We tried to keep him calm and talk him into getting down. One person kept offering him a lighter to persuade him, but he wouldn\u0027t do it, Howard said. After several hours, Howard\u0027s neighbour Lee lost patience and climbed out onto his own kitchen roof, which is connected to the other ones on the road. The man jumped down and started garden-hopping fences, pursued by the residents. My son Liam was the fastest - he managed to get to the end of the street, where the man had hopped over a six-foot fence. Liam jumped through a patch of the nettles without even looking, and vaulted straight over it after him, Howard said. We ran around and found Liam had got the man in a headlock. We were able to walk him back over to the police, who arrested him.

Tributes have been left at Loughborough Station with someone spray painting a shutter \u0027RIP\u0027 with three hearts underneath.    Wellwishers also left three bottles of spray paint with the nozzles removed - in pink, yellow and orange. Fellow graffiti artists are repeating the mantra \u0027Rest in Paint\u0027 on social media sites. But former TfL board member Brian Cooke has sparked outrage for calling the men \u0027common scum\u0027. In response to a BBC report on the incident Mr Cooke, from Beckenham, south London, tweeted: Why do BBC News keep referring to the guys killed at Loughborough Junction as graffiti \u0027artists\u0027 they are no such thing they are common scum and criminals who cost the railway millions and keep fares high.  His message prompted a furious response with one critic saying: 3 lives lost, undoubtedly a traumatised train driver... shame on you for such reckless and thoughtless comments and opinion on a tragedy spare a thought for their families before you type! Mr Cooke has now made his twitter profile private.   On the Real london graffiti page on Facebook a picture has been shared of the clear bag of evidence collected by police at the scene yesterday morning - which included spray cans - saying RIP Kbag - Lover - Trip.  Loughborough Junction is an elevated station managed by Thameslink and located on a line between Herne Hill and Elephant and Castle stations. It is near three other lines used by trains which do not stop at the station. The area is said to be a graffiti hotspot - with its proximity to Brixton and a trend in youngsters to try and get their tag on tricky-to-reach spots along the railway line. Investigators believe the tragedy took place in the early hours and are working to identify which train struck the men.

Louisa Jenson admitted fighting with Laura Gwin but maintained that she did not bite her. Last week she was cleared of unlawful wounding. The 27-year-old said that although she was found not guilty, the ordeal of being arrested and the process of going through a trial caused her to lose her job, miscarry the twins she was pregnant with and suffer post traumatic stress disorder. Speaking to the Liverpool Echo after the trial Louisa said that she had went to Miss Gwin\u0027s home in October last year to discuss ongoing issues between them.  Kevin Slack, prosecuting, told the court the women had fallen out over rent arrears owed by Miss Gwin to Jensen\u0027s aunt, and comments made about each other to parents at their children\u0027s school. On the day of the incident Laura Gwin text Miss Jensen\u0027s aunt saying: “The sorriest thing (Jensen) will ever do is thinking she is so big and clever. I will rip her f****** head off when I see her.” Miss Jensen said that as their children attend the same school she was concerned that something would kick off in front of the kids and other parents at the school gates. She said: I didn\u0027t want it to keep getting worse, I was hoping to sort things out but it escalated really quickly. Both women then got into a fight in Miss Gwin\u0027s front garden before being separated by Laura Gwin\u0027s boyfriend. Miss Gwin, 30, lost almost the entire fingernail portion of the index finger on her left hand, including bone, and was left covered in blood after the incident on October 11 last year. Louisa, from Kirkby, walked out of Liverpool Crown Court on Friday after being cleared of unlawful wounding without intent by a jury, but has since said the ordeal has ruined her life. She said: I don\u0027t deny going to her house but I did not mean for it to get physical. After the fight I went straight to the police station to report it, but they told me to come back in an hour because they were busy.

Emmanuel Olubayo could only watch helplessly as Emma, a nursing team leader, collapsed from an undetected heart defect and died in the home they shared in Leicestershire. Paramedics tried for an hour to resuscitate the 41-year-old before performing a rare posthumous delivery.  They carried out an emergency Caesarean section on the living room floor last November, Leicestershire Live reports.  The couple\u0027s baby girl Aretha was delivered alive then taken to hospital.  Emmanuel said he was shocked to become a father and a widower on the same day. The 35-year-old education consultant said: “It is hard and I don’t really know how I am coping as single dad but I am. “I have to be strong for Aretha. One day I will tell her all about her mother and how wonderful she was.” He said he believed his wife of eight months, whose heart suddenly stopped, had battled on to give their daughter Aretha the chance to live. Aretha was born 10 weeks prematurely and was taken to hospital where she was cared for by members of the team that Emma led – the critical care outreach team which covers Glenfield Hospital, Leicester Royal Infirmary and Leicester General Hospital.  Emmanuel, who was living in Birmingham, told how he and Emma fell in love after meeting in an internet dating chat room. “I knew when I started chatting to Emma online that she was special, he said. We had an immediate connection. “We got on really well and arranged to meet after three weeks chatting.” The pair had their first date at the Parcel Yard pub in Leicester in May 2016.  Emmanuel said: “I caught a train after work and we met at about 7pm. “We did not want the night to end and I caught the last train home to Birmingham. “The evening had flown by and we talked about everything and nothing. “We could not wait to see each other and were in contact all the time from that night on. “it was as if we were meant to be together.” The romance blossomed as Emma travelled to Birmingham and Emmanuel came to Leicester to see each other. In December 2016 – seven months after they first chatted online – Emmanuel popped the question. “We were out for meal in Birmingham when I got down on one knee in the restaurant, he said. “I gave Emma a sapphire ring and asked her to marry me. “She said yes and was ecstatic. Everyone cheered. It was beautiful.” The pair married in Birmingham in April 2017.  Within a month Emma was pregnant. Emmanuel said: “We were both delighted that we were pregnant so quickly. “Everything was going so well. It was great and we were making plans for the future. We wanted a couple of children. “We did not want to know what sex the baby was. We wanted it to be a surprise. “It was fun choosing names for a boy and for a girl.” Aretha was taken to hospital and was finally allowed home a month before her due date.  More than 650 people attended Emma’s funeral and friends have set up an online fund-raising page for Emmanuel and Aretha.  Clair Ripley, who set up the fund, said online: “Emma was a highly regarded nurse at University Hospitals of Leicester and was the driving force behind the Critical Care Outreach and Sepsis Teams. “Some of you may be aware and some of you may not, but unfortunately on November 26 2017, Emma suddenly passed away. “She was so very loved as a wife, daughter, sister, auntie, friend and colleague.

One year on from the tower block tragedy, more than 300 leaseholders at Vallea Court and Cypress Place in the Green Quarter, Manchester, have been arguing their case at a tribunal. Their freeholder, the investor Pemberstone, has issued them with a demand for \u0026pound3m out of the blue. That was the result of investigations carried out in the wake of the London blaze, which found the same dangerously flammable material had been used on their blocks. After the leaseholders refused to pay, Pemberstone launched legal action against them - which saw residents crowd-fund enough money to pay for legal advice, but still unable to fund a lawyer for the hearing. Fran Reddington, 33, says the community has had no help from the council, the mayor’s office, the government or anyone else, adding that they have effectively been left to fend for themselves.  “The hardest thing for us is that we have not really had any support from anybody,” she said. “We got the official letters from the management company but then we got hit by these notices and we didn’t really know what to do. “Luckily we have got quite a strong community and set up this Facebook group to see what we could do together. So that’s how we got the crowdfunding.  We didn’t have the option of a lawyer though and just had to fight for ourselves. “It’s so stressful and we’ve just been left. The worst thing is that we’re just being ignored.” The two Green Quarter blocks, which are managed by Living City, were built by international development giant Lend Lease. In recent years the freehold has been sold on to Pemberstone, a property investment giant that owns residential and commercial buildings across the country, which argues that under the terms of their leases the residents should pay for any remedial works themselves.  However a copy of one introduction letter sent by Lend Lease to a purchaser - who had bought their flat directly from them - states that ‘Lend Lease will undertake, at our expense, to complete any accepted defect that has arisen as a result of either faulty materials or defective workmanship’. Nevertheless while the buildings are understood to still be under warranty, residents have so far also been unable to claim costs for removing and replacing the cladding through insurance - and they say Lend Lease has been silent on the issue. Residents have also noted that the developer, states in its corporate vision that ‘companies must start justifying their worth to society, with greater emphasis placed on environmental and social impact rather than straight economics’. Marketing consultant Katie Kelly bought her flat from the developer four years ago. “Not only are big businesses failing to do the right thing, they are happily putting over 300 people’s lives at risk,” she said.  “The way the whole situation has been handled, from taking us to a tribunal which we will likely have to pay for, to taking over a year to even begin work to make our homes safe, is crazy.   “I can’t understand how nobody from these businesses feels responsible.”  Leaseholders say they have no idea what will happen if they lose the tribunal and are left literally unable to pay the money. Lucy Powell, MP for next-door Manchester Central, has been dealing with a number of such cases in the city over the past year, including a similar dispute at the Chips building in New Islington. A few weeks ago housing minister Dominic Raab responded to an inquiry from her on the issue, reiterating that private sector companies should ‘do the right thing’ and not pass the costs on to leaseholders. However his letter does not outline any government plans to force the hand of those who will not, adding that ministers are keeping the situation ‘under review’.  Lucy Powell said that one year on from Grenfell blaze, on June 14 last year, the government’s position was ‘not good enough’. “I have been helping lots of residents who are concerned about fire safety – particularly in private blocks, she added. “In many cases they are also worried about being forced to pay huge sums to make their buildings safe. “In a recent reply I received from the government I was told that the government were urging companies not to pass costs on to leaseholders but this is not good enough.  “People who bought their homes in good faith now find that they may not be safe and on top of their worries, they are often being asked to pay large sums of money to put that right.” One year on, the government is ‘nowhere near’ sorting out the implications of Grenfell for the private housing sector, she added. The tribunal is expected to take around six weeks to report back.  A spokesperson for Pemberstone said: “The tribunal is a well established forum to which either landlords or leaseholders can apply to establish clarity on an issue that affects the management of a residential building and its service charge.  “Tribunals are independent and are widely used within the residential property sector. They are particularly appropriate for large schemes like this where there are 345 apartment owners, some of whom are investors located overseas.   “We believe an independent decision from a tribunal would be in the best interests for all concerned and should allow us to establish a clear way forward.  “Our property managers Livingcity are in regular contact with apartment owners and have been providing regular updates.  “Over the past year they have sent out nine letters to all leaseholders explaining the latest position and have issued responses to at least 78 individual enquiries.  “They have an office on site and a web portal on which they post information.  “They also hold regular residents’ meetings including one in February attended by over 100 individuals.

Punters posed for the cameras with ladies dressed in floral outfits and brightly coloured fascinators and gents sporting top hats and elegant suits. Many faced breathalyser tests and bag searches as organisers seek to clamp down on anti-social behaviour this year. There has also been a crackdown on beer sales and an increased stewarding presence. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will join the Queen at the huge sporting event later today where they are expected to present the winning trophy for the St James\u0027 Palace Stakes at 4.20pm. It\u0027s believed The Queen has also invited the newlyweds to join her in the royal box this week at the Berkshire race course.  A carriage procession, with The Queen at its head, signals the start of each day of the event, and Harry and Meghan could be part of the spectacle. Ahead of the big race at 3.40pm racegoers poured into the venue dressed to the nines. Kelly Brooke was among the crowd, sporting a football themed hat from Ladbrokes to celebrate England’s football hopes. The star of the bookmaker’s latest racing ad campaign, says: “I really want to show my support for the Three Lions and by wearing this gorgeous Ladbrokes hat designed by Ilda Di Vico, I think I have done just that.”   The hat features a Bobby Moore figure holding aloft a Jules Rimet trophy and was designed by milliner Ilda Di Vico. Royal Ascot is renowned for its strict dress code and this year men must wear socks or risk being turned away from the famous race meet which is one of the highlights of the social calendar. With the UK having enjoyed good weather in the past few months the fashion for wearing shoes without socks may have crept into Royal Ascot. This year\u0027s visitors sported an array of fashionable outfits - with ladies arriving in pastel pencil dress, brightly coloured stripy skirts and even a four of diamonds inspired dress.  Rupert Adams from William Hill said: Ascot have tightened up the dress code for the royal meeting and many of the millennial generation might not even own socks. Punters traditionally have a bet on the colour of the Queen\u0027s hat with blue the favourite with bookies at the moment for the first day. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: Punters reckon Her Majesty will opt for a trusty shade of blue on the opening day of the Royal meeting. Last year there was a massive gamble on the Queen wearing blue as she wore blue to the state opening of Parliament before travelling to Royal Ascot, but she changed into another coloured outfit for the race meet.  The Queen spoke about her fondness for Royal Ascot in her foreword for the official programme: My family and I greatly look forward to Royal Ascot. As the royal meeting has evolved in recent times, it remains one of Britain\u0027s finest sporting occasions with 300,000 racegoers enjoying the unique heritage of Royal Ascot every year, and many more people watching at home. Tradition and innovation sit comfortably together, over five days of racing. International competition is a compelling feature in the modern era, and it is always a delight to welcome horses and jockeys from around the world to this wonderful racecourse.

Dawn Dawson weighed 28st 9lbs at her biggest after gorging on two takeaways, four bacon sandwiches and two litres of fizzy pop every day.  The 38-year-old, who now weighs 10st 9lbs, ate so much that she developed type 2 diabetes, a high cholesterol level and regularly took painkillers to help with the aches and pains that piling on the pounds had caused. However, she decided to make a change when her 61-year-old dad Steve Hadley passed away in November 2014 due to cancer, which Dawn believes was triggered by obesity.  The mum-of-two worried she would be next and ditched her junk food addiction and lost 6st 7lbs by herself before joining Slimming World in August 2015 for extra support.   By November 2017, Dawn had completed her amazing weight loss and dropped down to an incredible size 10 and now no longer has to take any form of medication. Dawn, from Chester-Le-Street, in County Durham, said: “Losing my dad gave me a massive kick up the backside. I thought if I don’t stop eating, I’m going to die. “I often think to myself, ‘how didn’t I end up in a serious state?’ It is a mystery to me. It is a scary thought. I don’t know how I carried on doing that for so long. “I would eat until it hurt. I used to secret snack two or three times a day, just to make myself feel full. I would just eat anything that was put in front of me. It was just pure greed. “I didn’t want to join my dad. I didn’t want to leave my children. I would have ended up in serious trouble. I wanted to save my life and that is what I’ve done.  “I had been big all of my life but I’m not that person anymore. I have got my life to live now and I’m going to live it.” The full-time carer to her mum Carol Hadley, 60, revealed that because of her ballooning dress size, she couldn’t even walk to the top of her street without getting out of breath. Dawn said: “It restricted me from doing so much. I was terrified of going out before. I was embarrassed to just go to the park with my kids [Daniel, 5 and Amelia, 3] but now I can even go on the rides. “It is a lot easier with my kids now. They have a mum now. My husband was doing everything with them before. I am so much more involved.” After losing the weight, Dawn was left with a lot of excess skin but in March this year she had it surgically removed to complete her transformation.

Calley Bingham was diagnosed with cervical cancer just four months after giving birth to her third child. After a long ordeal of surgery and therapies, Calley, now aged 27, overcame cancer but she has been left with lymphoedema, a condition where one of her legs swells up to almost twice the size of the other. Lymphoedema affects around 200,000 people in the UK, and Calley is determined to provide support through her new charity.   How to avoid deep vein thrombosis on a long flight - and other issues you face on a plane   The young woman from Meare, near Glastonbury, told Somerset Live : When I was diagnosed with cervical cancer my world fell apart. In the very beginning we all held our breath and prayed.  At a stage 1B2 - I was cureable. I underwent a 7.5 hour operation to remove my womb, cervix, fallopian tubes and part of my vagina and my pelvic lymph nodes. Then I had to go through six weeks of chemo-radiation and two lots of brachytherapy. I was grateful to be alive.   Mum sues hospital after waking up with permanent breast implants after her double mastectomy  I knew all this could cause lymphoedema, but there was no guarantee and I guess, like everyone else, you just assume it won\u0027t be you it happens to, or hope, at least. It started off with mild swelling but got worse. I was diagnosed with lymphoedema in my inner thigh in January last year and there is no chance of a cure. My experience with the condition has been painful - physically and mentally draining. It has changed the way I see myself and others see me. It changed the clothes and shoes I can wear and the amount of exercise I\u0027m able to do. The only treatment available includes Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) massage, which she travels to Taunton for weekly, and compression stockings, which she has to wear every day.   Mum \u0027too ashamed to go outside\u0027 after her eyes swelled shut after eyebrow tint  Having two legs completely different sizes brings about day-to-day problems for the young mum, especially as retailers don\u0027t cater for people with this or similar condition. Calley explains how shopping for clothes has become difficult: In the year and a half that I have had lymphoedema, my leg and foot have nearly doubled in size. Currently I carry four litres more fluid in my left leg and it is 40 per cent bigger than my right. Bandaging to reduce the size of my leg was unsuccessful and I have now been put forward for lymph assist treatment. One of the biggest things for me is that I couldn\u0027t just buy some Nikes or something young and in fashion to wear. Retailers don\u0027t provide odd pairs. The only shoes I am able to find that are comfortable and fit are more suitable for older people to be honest. I got in contact with Nike and various other shoe brands only to be told they didn\u0027t have a procedure to sell me a pair of odd shoes. Clarks said they did sell odd pairs but I\u0027d have to pay more than standard price. And again their styles aren\u0027t ones I would pick. I feel like people stare enough. I tend to wear leggings or stretchy jeggings as they stretch over the big leg, but I am having issues with them so my mum is making me lighter clothes for the summer. Inspired by her experience of dealing with retailers, Calley has made it her mission to help people with the same problem.

Agalarov’s son Emin, a famous Russian singer, performed at the wedding, while guests reportedly indulged in salmon carpaccio. “Guests were treated to salmon carpaccio, all kinds of fish, Uzbek pilaf, shish kebab, Iranian apricots, fresh berries and cake, according to one account. “Bottles of chilled French champagne did not have time to end, as new ones appeared on the table.” The occasion is estimated to have cost a massive \u0026pound1.2 million. Irina is famous for admitting to terrible shock when - after a childhood of flying on private jets - she realised \u0027ordinary\u0027 people were sharing her plane on her first experience going economy class.  Explaining the \u0027horrors\u0027 of mass travel, she wrote on Instagram: \u0027I entered a plane and saw that there were a lot of people. “And I asked the stewardess out loud: ‘And what, all these people will fly with us?’” She claimed she had never “risked so much” in her life. Reports said the teenager could not even imagine that onboard, in addition to her family and friends, strangers might be flying too. Irina, who said she was 14 at the time, later deleted the entry.  The bride, from Russia’s superrich and highly privileged ‘golden youth’, also previously asked De Niro to bring her some water after mistaking him for a waiter. “I was nine or ten, everybody was smoking and that is why I got confused,” she said. “He told me that it\u0027s not hard to bring me some water.” Reports in Russia claim the teenager also posted previously about her handbags costing almost \u0026pound6,000 on social media.

He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful. That first season also saw the team switch to first choice home Carolina Port, the ground many fans still believe was their original home.And if that first campaign couldn’t quite be described as auspicious, it was a start and the beginning of an eventful next 125 years.n Tomorrow – The Managers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2780ce3cc0e-270x180.jpg ","title":"almost blue more dundee venues than ever to host gigs at city blues festival","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA record number of venues will take part in Dundee’s Almost Blue 2018 live music festival in just over a week’s time.Across the city, 31 pubs and venues have signed up for this year’s festival over the weekend of June 29-30 and July 1, beating 2017’s previous record of 26.This year, for the first time, venues will take part in the West End and Hilltown, along with a raft of other pubs new to the festival.Organisers say the increase shows the snowballing popularity of Almost Blue – formed in 2012 with only two venues – has grown dramatically since the demise of the former Dundee Blues Bonanza five years ago.Among the new venues taking part for the first time are the Q Bar at the Queens Hotel on Nethergate, Cookies on Hilltown and the Campbeltown Bar on Hawkhill.

Germany have only lost six World Cup matches since being beaten in the 1986 final – that’s 45 games in all – and are one of the big favourites to land their fifth world crown.Coach Joachim Low caused headlines last week by leaving Manchester City’s flying winger Leroy Sane out of his 23-man pool.The fact Low felt able to go to Russia without Sane shows just how strong this German squad is.Dortmund’s Marco Reus, however, is in the 23 and will grace the World Cup for the first time at the age of 29 after missing 2014 with injury.The Germans look certain to cruise through Group F without much fuss.Star player: Thomas Muller (among many).Local link: There are a few but, going back a bit, the name Erich Schaedler stands out.The son of a German prisoner of war, Schaedler played 120 times for the Dark Blues between 1977 and 1981, winning the First Division at Dens Park.Schaedler played for Scotland against West Germany funnily enough and went to the 1974 tournament but never featured.Dundee have also had Luka Tankulic and Thomas Konrad on their books a couple of years ago.The name Arvid Schenk, meanwhile, will send a shiver down dark blue spines.MexicoScotland have just found out how good the Mexicans are with the 1-0 scoreline in the Azteca not doing their performance justice  earlier this month.Moving the ball quickly, Juan Carlos Osorio’s side like to pepper the opposition goal and if they can find the finishing touch that eluded them against the Scots they might surprise a few.Legendary captain Rafael Marquez, a double Champions League winner with Barcelona, will join a select few who have played at five World Cups at the age of 39 if he features.Star player: Javier Hernandez.Local link: Former Dundee United favourite Johnny Russell got his first international start in Mexico last weekend and impressed.Alan Gilzean scored against Mexican club side Guadalajara in 1962 when Dundee’s league-winning side took part in a friendly summer tournament in New York. The Dee won 3-2.SwedenWithout talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic to call on, the Swedes are nowhere near as potent as they have been in recent years.However, knocking Italy out in the qualifying play-offs shows they have some mettle about them.Ranked 25th in the world, this is their first World Cup since 2006 where they reached the last 16.Star player: Emil Forsberg.Local link: Only one place to start here – Gothenburg.After knocking Barcelona out, Dundee United were so close to Uefa Cup glory against IFK Gothenburg in 1987, only to lose out by one goal over two legs.Swedes haven’t been all bad for the Tangerines, however, with Kjell Olofsson, Orjan Persson, Lars Zetterlund, Lennart Wing and Magnus Skoldmark all performing with distinction in lengthy spells at Tannadice.South KoreaThe Koreans scraped into the World Cup with a defeat and two 0-0 draws against Iran and Uzbekistan and haven’t set the heather alight in friendlies running up to the tournament.Tottenham forward Son Heung-min, however, is a threat to be reckoned with for the rest of the group.Star player: Son Heung-min.Local link: Christian Dailly captained Berti Vogts’ Scotland side to a 4-1 thumping at the hands of South Korea prior to their incredible run to the World Cup semi-finals in 2002.Lee Wilkie was an unused sub.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/tonny-mols-226x180.jpg ","title":"the tele guide to the world cup group gs local links","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYet again Scotland won’t be there but all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action is well under way and today we give our lowdown on Group G where England kick off their tournament against Tunisia in the evening kick-off after Belgium take on minnows Panama.Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the Tartan Army’s absence, we’ll also provide a local link, tenuous or otherwise, to each participating nation.GROUP GBelgiumThe pressure is on a golden generation of Belgian football to deliver in 2018 after disappointing in the last European Championships where they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Wales.They also reached the last eight of the last World Cup, their best finish since coming fourth in Mexico in 1986.A squad with names like Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku, Dries Mertens, Vincent Kompany and Thibaut Courtois will be a force to be reckoned with.The Belgians look clear favourites to top Group G.Star player: Eden Hazard.Local link: Dundee swept past Belgian champions Anderlecht to book their place in the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1963, winning 4-1 away and 2-1 at Dens Park.60,000 people crammed into the Emile Verse Stadium to watch Alan Gilzean (2), Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith fire the Dark Blues to victory.Belgian Tonny Mols spent an injury-hit season at Tannadice in 1998-99 after being signed by Tommy McLean. He featured 16 times before signing for Arbroath.PanamaNewcomers Panama knocked the United States of America out of the World Cup by beating Costa Rica on the final day of qualifying in North and Central America.This their first World Cup, Panama are rank outsiders in the competition and are the whipping boys of Group G.A 6-0 friendly thumping by Switzerland in March doesn’t bode well.Star player: Luis Tejeda.Local link: Scraping the barrel with this one but here goes.While being Dundee’s No 1 goalie, Kelvin Jack kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Panama as Trinidad and Tobago went on to qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Germany.TunisiaThe North Africans are in their fourth World Cup finals, their first since 2006, but are yet to make it out of the group stages.Tunisia became the first African team to win a World Cup match by beating Mexico 3-1 in 1978 but haven’t won another game at a finals since.An ingenuous – or some might say illegal – way of getting around the fast during daylight in the Muslim month of Ramadan in warm-up games against Portugal, Turkey and Spain saw goalkeeper Mouez Hassen get treatment for an ‘injury’ immediately after sunset to allow his team-mates to break their fast with dates and water.

He played 11 times for Poland while Czachowski picked up 45 caps.The ‘Mad Monk’ Grzegorz Szamotulski, Lukasz Zaluska and Rado Cierzniak were all top goalies at Tannadice while Jaroslaw Fojut had a decent spell in 2014-15. They have 15 caps between them.SenegalJust their second appearance at a finals since they exploded on to the scene in 2002 by beating world champions France in the opener in South Korea.The West Africans would love to repeat their run to the last eight then and will fancy their chances of getting out of this group.Star player: Sadio Mane.Local link: French-born Morgaro Gomis played more than 200 games for Dundee United over two spells.Now 32, Gomis plays in Malaysia but picked up two international caps with Senegal in 2009 while at Tannadice.Yet again Scotland won’t be there but, with just one sleep until the big kick-off, all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action starts tomorrow when the hosts take on Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.Tonight the

Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspONCE-in-a-lifetime plans to transform eyesore buildings in the heart of Inverness into a major attraction will take several years to come to fruition, with discussions yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116213.jpg","title":"Chelsie is delighted with her pageant debut","story":"\u0026nbspMISS Scotland finalist Chelsie Allison says she remains proud of her achievement, despite being pipped to the title at the final hurdle.The social work student, from Kirkhill, finished just a point behind winner Linzi McClelland at Friday\u0027 showpiece event.Chelsie (20), who was taking part in her first-ever pageant, said she loved the experience and now has her sights set on returning for another shot at the crown.\"I am very proud of how well I did,\" she said.\"There was only one point between myself and Linzi so that was quite frustrating, just because it was so close.\"I didn\u0026rsquot even think I would get as far as I did.\"It was the first pageant-type event I had ever done and I really enjoyed it.\"I thought it would be quite stressful but it wasn\u0026rsquot at all like that.\"You don\u0026rsquot really have any time to think about that, which is probably a good thing.\"As soon as the show started it was just go, go, go.\"The organisers have already asked me to go back again in the future and that\u0027 something I\u0026rsquod be really keen to do.\"The top three girls get to go for a photoshoot with some of the sponsors.

bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the

\"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here

St Cyrus is a lovely coastal town where everyone knows everyone.”The young graduate said her interest in politics was spurred on after she got the chance to interview MSPs in Holyrood in January as part of her studies.Roisean, who called the experience “empowering”, added: “I went down to Holyrood in January where I interviewed MSPs and I loved it.“It was so fascinating. It was all women MSPs and that is something I am massively interested in.“I’m a feminist, and so encouraging more women into politics is something I am invested in.”As part of her dissertation, Roisean focused on the success of female MSPs.She said: “Currently all our literature is on why women are unsuccessful, and reading that made me think, ‘No I don’t want to list all the reasons why women don’t do as well as men’.“I wanted to list all the reasons why all women do well despite adversity.”Her research found the success of women in politics had “nothing to do with being from a specific social group or if they were a mother or not a mother, but about their determination”.The graduate said: “It’s something I really enjoyed and, to be honest, it is something I want to do in the future.“Interviewing them was fascinating and empowering.”Roisean, who says she loved her time at the university, said:“Without the university’s support, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to pursue my interests.“I think Aberdeen University is amazing for giving me that.“My dissertation supervisor was so brilliant and helpful. When I hear different uni experiences, I just think ‘I love Aberdeen’.“All teachers are helpful – even if they’re not teaching your course.“I had a teacher who would sit and help me go through my drafts and proof read them with me, from the small things to the big things.”Roisean is the third generation in her family to graduate from the city university.She comes from a family of Aberdeen University alumni who took a trip back to their old haunts to see her receive her degree.Roisean’s parents, brother and boyfriend were all watching proudly as she graduated.“My dad graduated in history and politics – so quite similar. And my mum did counselling.“My granny did law and then changed because she felt she could help more people by doing social work. My grandpa studied sociology partly before moving on to work in the NHS.“Both my brothers are going to Aberdeen College to eventually go to Aberdeen University.”Now that she has graduated, Roisean wants to further her studies with a masters in marketing management at Aberdeen University in the coming year.She said: “I want to work within business for a while, particularly in oil and gas.“It is particularly male dominated and I’d like to make a change there.“Maybe later I would like to work within politics after getting some business experience as an

terminal’s new security hall and duty free area at 4am.The development, which is being done in three phases, has already seen the creation of a new international arrivals hall and baggage reclaim area.By the time all the improvements have been completed next year the airport will have increased in size by 50%.Aberdeen International Airport managing director Carol Benzie said the opening of phase two would probably have the biggest impact to passengers.She said: “We are so excited with the opening.“I think phase two is more significant than phase one because all passengers flying through Aberdeen International Airport will have to go through the new security, walk through the new world duty free and see the impact of what we have done behind the boards for the last year.”The new security hall is much brighter and spacious than the old one and features a new body scanner that can examine passengers in 0.3 seconds – something it’s hoped will cut queues.The new bright LED screen after the security hall displays an image of sunset at Dunnottar Castle and signals the start of the duty free area, which has doubled in size.A new World of Whisky shop will showcases rare and vintage tipples.Guests including north-east MPs, MSPs and both Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councillors, attended today’s grand opening.Ms Benzie said: “Both phase one and phase two have now both been delivered on time and within budget.“Phase three is the most complex phase as it is right in the heart of the working terminal, so passengers will feel the impact, with changes and flows in terms of where they are going.“It will open up in three stages as well, the first in October, second in April and last in September. By that point 90% of the terminal will have been transformed.”Phase three of the development will see the addition of a new departure lounge and kitchen area.Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Rothesay officially opened phase one of the development in October last year.She met airport workers, contractors and business leaders and toured the new passenger lounge and baggage reclaim area.Carol added that the latest work would make a real difference to people using the airport and their journeys.She said: “Investment in an airport is sometimes not visible to the naked eye. We spend a lot of money outside maintaining taxi ways and resurfacing the runway, so now it is time for something tangible for the passengers to see and experience.“I think there is more space now, it’s less stressful and the new security area is much quieter.“We have the modern technology now. There is more vibrancy about it. It is shinier and brighter.“There is a more pleasant ambience all around.

A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon. It was a huge step in my recovery and helped to draw attention to this devastating condition while raising money for a wonderful charity that I\u0026#8217m proud to be an ambassador for.Walk Your Way takes place between 17 June and 1 July to raise money to support stroke survivors and their families.  You can walk the whole 26.2 miles in one go, do it over a few days or spread the distance over the two-week period and get sponsored to do it. It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties. By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"harbour gallery open entry call from tarbert golf club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 01/06/18, 5:48 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSunday June 3, sees the Stuart Herd Harbour Gallery Open take place at Glenralloch with an entry fee of £15.The club is hopeful that the recent good weather will encourage a healthy turnout of competitors for this popular event.There are four nett prizes and four scratch prizes on offer with the winner receiving one of Stuart\u0026#8217s stunning prints of a scene from Tarbert golf course.To book your entry please call the club at 01880 820565.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ban smoking outside cafes could","story":"NewsBan on smoking outside cafes could be ditchedSouth Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:10, 18 JUN 2018NewsNino and Karen Pajovic, owners of Cafe Le Monde, have received much public support (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA law banning smoking outside cafes could be binned within weeks. South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

The mother-of-two said: “I have always wanted to do something out the ordinary so decided to a skydive for Down’s syndrome. “I have the most amazing nephew ever and love him will all my heart and want to do this for him and to raise awareness.  “I see people raising funds for other charities all the time, but this one is important to me and I have never seen any fundraisers for Down’s Syndrome. “It’s something I have never had the cause to do, but now I do. “Reeve is five in September and I decided to try and get my work colleagues to do it. “We started with 17 people interested, but it’s whittled down to just Megan and I now. “Between us we have raised \u0026pound800 so far which is fantastic.” Joanne has raised \u0026pound320 on her Just Giving page so far and is calling for more donations towards her skydive on June 19.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12698905.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/asr_ayp_060618Mhari5.jpg","title":"meet weeks wedding week","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Wedding of the WeekMhari Bryce, 27-year-old Reception Manager from Hamilton married 36-year-old Operations Manager Chris Rowe from Manchester.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie16:18, 13 JUN 2018NewsNewlyweds Mhari and Chris pose in front of a picturesque backdrop (Image: Adore photography)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeet this week’s Wedding of the Week couple. Mhari Bryce, 27-year-old Reception Manager from Hamilton married 36-year-old Operations Manager Chris Rowe from Manchester. The pair now live in Ayr. “We met on a training course in Livingston in 2010 - Chris offered me his last jelly baby!” said Mhari. “It was after Chris moved from Livingston to Ayr that we started dating properly and have been together since.” The couple tied the knot on Sunday, April 1 at The Waterside Hotel in West Kilbride. Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.  Mhari said: “The cake was made by my aunt. “It was baked in Norwich then driven all the way to Scotland and built. “All the flowers are made of icing to match the flowers in my bouquet.” Linzi of Linzi Smith Hair at Distinction styled the hair for the day while Elaine Sawyer of Lookz Mobile Makeup Artist created the makeup looks. The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who travelled the distance to make our special day - some all the way from Texas. “Also a massive thank you to Ryan and Stacey of The Waterside - our day ran perfectly all thanks to them.” For more photos of this week\u0027s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on Stow  39 s historic graveyard","story":"SOME of Stow\u0027s earliest history is about to be straightened and restored.\nHistorians

funding from the Toddleburn (Parish of Stow) Wind Farm Community Fund to help with the work.\nThe graveyard, which contains the remains of Stow\u0026rsquos Auld Kirk as well as memorials dating back to the 17th century, has been in need of repair for decades.\nStow and Fountainhall Community Council worked with Scottish Borders Council and Historic Environment Scotland to gain the required permissions as the Auld Kirk is a scheduled monument.\nThe Auld Kirk, which was consecrated in 1242, has previously been painstakingly restored by local resident Robin McMillan.\nAnd the restoration of the graveyard will complete his work to showcase part of the fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local community and it is great to finally get the first grant of money to allow these works to go ahead.\n\"There is a lot of specialist

includes a visit in 1142 by King David I, a visit in 1297 by William Wallace and a visit in 1513 by Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, prior to the battle of Flodden.\nThe restoration, which is widely supported across the local community, will commence this summer with the repair of an iconic monument, after the required funding was donated by residents of Stow.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Mum

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

The Depute Procurator Fiscal said he believed the practice of young men going at night to farms was becoming very common, farms when the men were absent being singled out for attention and the conduct of the accused on this occasion was, to say the least, pretty bad.A number of farmers had informed him that their one objection to joining the Volunteer Force was that if they left the house at night occurrences of this kind were sure to take place.Theft of rhododendron bloomsA girl residing in Campbeltown was charged with having, on May 28 in the grounds adjoining the public road from Carradale Post Office to the pier, and beside the entrance gate to Carradale Stables, stolen two rhododendron blooms.Accused admitted taking the blooms but said she did not know they were private property.She had gone to Carradale to inquire after a situation and was returning to the ferry when she spotted the flowers and climbed over a wall to get them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"st columbas conventicle","story":"All religions have a mixture of good and bad points as do most political parties.When dealing with history, too, there are some literal truths, which both ministers at last Sunday\u0026#8217s Keil St Columba\u0026#8217s conventicle appeared to skip past.It was mentioned that the 6th century missionary based his teaching on a Bible written in Latin, but not that his name translated means \u0026#8216dove,\u0026#8217 a potent symbol of peace.In addition, at that time before the schism with Rome, St Columba, who also spoke Gaelic, offered the pagan hordes an education and health service rolled into one, with its roots in Europe.St Columba and his monks were the educated people of their time.While the medicine might well have been rudimentary, it was based on the learning of the Roman empire.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

It was unveiled ahead of World Oceans Day today (Friday) and was played for the first time in the sea at the beach, by musician Thoren Ferguson.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

Doug Haig from the Bridge Centre said to do a world record attempt because it would be great for publicity and a lot of fun.  The group decided to make it an unofficial world record attempt because they were worried they would have to turn away people who were not dancing in time to the music.

The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience. In the end I think I achieved something special.\"  Ali Smith, founder of Art Pistol Projects, said: \"Mackintosh is a bit of a global superstar so we had to get this one right.  \"Stepping away from the wall now it really feels like a special one, a just portrayal of such an iconic and well-loved figure.  \"Everyone that\u0027s been involved deserves a big thanks.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7936576.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Singing for England  Musician   s rallying call for Scotland to get behind their old rivals in World Cup","story":"              A SCOTTISH musician has issued a rallying call for his countrymen to get behind their old rivals in the World Cup.

That works in reverse order too obviously.  \"I\u0027ve done this with a humble heart, trying to support our fellow islanders.  \"The cultural and economic links between Scotland and England couldn\u0027t be deeper.  \"To the tiny minority of Scots who get spiteful about the English football team, I\u0027d say go and have a chat with the whisky distilleries up north and ask them how they\u0027d feel if they lost their English customer base.\"  The singer-songwriter won a BAFTA for his music in the thriller film Killer.

The 53-year-old has gone on trial accused of putting his hand down a woman\u0027s trousers and touching her bottom as they danced at her hen night in Atik nightclub in Edinburgh last June.  The woman, who cannot be identified, said she saw Leslie when they entered the club and recognised him from television, particularly Blue Peter.  Leslie is on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court under his real name John Stott and denies the charge.  The accuser was the first to give evidence and said she had spoken to Leslie during the night about football, some of his ex-girlfriends and speculation he could appear in TV programme Celebrity Big Brother.  While dancing with friends and a stag party later in the night she said Leslie approached her and said \"be careful, you\u0027re getting married\".  She said she thought he was being \"protective\" and suggested they dance together.  Leslie had a hand on her waist and she had a hand on his shoulder, the court heard.  The woman said: \"We\u0027d been going in circles then he pulled me closer.  \"I did feel uncomfortable but thought I was maybe reading too much into it.\"  She said she gave her friend \"a look\" to make her aware she was uncomfortable, adding: \"After that I felt his hand go down my trousers at the back.  \"I didn\u0027t know how to react. I made even more of a look to my friend because I knew I needed to be out of that situation.\"  She said Leslie touched her skin but was not sure if he had put his hand beneath her underwear.  The woman told the court a friend pulled her away and then danced briefly with her hen party to \"pretend it hadn\u0027t happened\".  She added: \"But then I got really upset so moved to the booth.\"  \"I asked my friend something like \u0027why did he think he could do that or what did I do to make him do that?\u0027\"  She went outside with a friend and her sister-in-law who said they should tell someone, the court heard.  She said they told a female bouncer and later a police officer at the nightclub who took her to a station to make a statement.  CCTV of the pair dancing in the busy club was played to the court and the woman said it could not be seen exactly when the alleged incident happened.  Asked by fiscal depute Fiona Nairn how she feels now, the woman said it had impacted on her relationship with her husband, friends and work.  She said: \"It\u0027s been one of the toughest years of my life when it should have been the happiest.\"  Under cross examination by defence lawyer Derek Ogg QC, she cried and said: \"I don\u0027t know why anyone would think I made this up. I have nothing to gain from it.\"  Mr Ogg put it to the woman the CCTV footage showed the dance with Leslie ended \"voluntarily\" rather than with a friend\u0027s intervention.  She said: \"That\u0027s not how I see it. I just wanted out of that situation.\"  It was also established that the woman was taken home by two police officers and given paper bags to place her clothing in with no forensic protocol in place.  Forensic scientist Sandra Coupar-White told the court she examined the woman\u0027s trousers, pants and tutu for potential DNA.  She said a mixed profile was found on the trouser waistband likely made up of touch DNA from the woman, Leslie and two other \"minor contributors\".  She told Ms Nairn that DNA could be passed indirectly from holding hands during by dancing but said direct contact with the inside of the waistband was more likely.  The results from the pants and tutu were inconclusive, Ms Coupar-White said.  Mr Ogg questioned if it was possible for Leslie\u0027s DNA to be passed from one item of clothing to another.  The witness said: \"Secondary transfer is possible.\"  The trial before Sheriff Adrian Cottam continues on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"Comment   Let s wipe away the tears and rebuild our beloved Mack ","story":"              LIKE so many Glaswegians, on Friday night I found myself wiping away tears as fire engulfed the Mackintosh building at Glasgow School of Art for the second time in four years.  I have a strong and very personal and relationship with this wonderful, magical, beautiful building. Over the years I\u0026rsquove seen countless exhibitions at the Mack, done various evening classes, danced and laughed with friends. I\u0026rsquove stood quietly and been bowled over again and again by its sheer elegance and practicality.  And by Saturday the initial sadness I felt turned to anger. How for the love of God could this happen again? How could four years of painstaking research and restoration by hundreds of craftspeople, the rebuilding of the peerless library, the ambitious plan to give every first year student at GSA a chance to study in the Mack, to live and breath its inspiration, have gone up in smoke?  Who or what was responsible for starting the fire and why did it take and spread so quickly? Were there not procedures in place to prevent this inconceivably grim turn of events?  We must be rigorous and ruthless in uncovering answers to all these questions and more in the months to come. In the aftermath of the 2014 fire, such inquiries were overshadowed by the outpouring of goodwill around restoration. This will not be the case this time around, and nor should it be. The people of Glasgow, Scotland and beyond deserve answers, not least because we gave so willingly and generously of our money to fund the restoration that now lies in ruins in Renfrew Street.  Once the fire service has produced its report into the cause of the blaze, a full public inquiry may be the only way to establish where responsibility lies and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.  But another, even more difficult question will soon need attention: what now for the Mack? It is painfully early days, of course, and since we don\u0026rsquot yet know the exact extent of the damage, or how viable the shell of the building may or may not be, at present thinking about the future just makes your head hurt.  But since this building has always been a place of ideas, creativity and ingenuity, I\u0026rsquom trying my damnedest to focus on the positives.  Firstly, the building is not, as some are suggesting, \u0026ldquogone. I went to see what remains twice at the weekend and grim as the experience was, what struck me was the fact that the once beautiful west gable, arguably the finest architectural aspect in Scotland, is still recognisable, as is the iconic front elevation.  Secondly, thanks to an innovative project started after the first fire in 2014, the entire building has been digitised to within a millimetre of its life, both inside and out. In this respect at least The Mack still exists in its full glory, making the experience of the teams that worked on the now destroyed restoration invaluable rather than wasted. We should also remember that many of the surviving fixtures and fittings from the 2014 fire are still in storage.  It will be possible to rebuild the Mack from scratch if that\u0026rsquos what it takes. We should take heart from the Frauenkirche in Dresden, rebuilt after German reunification over 10 years starting in 1994 after it was completely destroyed during World War Two. The miracle rebirth of this beautiful church is now part of its story, something that makes it even more interesting to visitors. Think, too, of the chamber of the House of Commons, totally rebuilt after being razed on the final day of the Blitz in 1941.  The Mack arguably exceeds either of these two buildings in terms of architectural and cultural importance. Its place in the hearts and imaginations of Glaswegians, meanwhile, simply cannot be overstated.  Yes, the cost of rebuilding from scratch would be astronomical - quite possibly into the hundreds of millions - though maybe not as much as a football stadium. And yes, any such project would require a daunting amount of political and civic will to succeed and take many years to realise. But surely if any building deserves this sort of effort, the Mack does.  A build of this scale and ambition would be a heritage project unlike any other undertaken in Scotland, one that could ultimately provide employment and training opportunities for hundreds of people. There are pros as well as cons to be considered. But the biggest pro of all would be the continued existence of the Mack, both as a physical presence and an idea. A world without it would be an eminently poorer place, after all.  Let\u0026rsquos be honest, the original Mack was lost in 2014 what was being re-created and restored until last week was already something new. A complete rebuild would represent yet another, even bigger leap of faith. But it could be done.  Ultimately, it will be up to GSA to decide, and I expect to hear calls for a different future for the site, a less costly one that could be filled with deserving, long-suffering students more quickly. But I believe the people of this great city will galvanise and rebuild their beloved Mack once again if that is what is asked of them. Come on Glasgow, what do you say?"},{"url":null,"title":"Councils  no longer provide quality services   say workers","story":"              Almost three in five council employees believe the local authority they work for no long provides quality services - with the same number also believing their council does not make the right decisions for the public.

A total of 57% of those who took part in survey - which was released to coincide with the union\u0027s local government conference - said they no longer believe their authority provides quality services, with the same proportion saying they did not think the council they work for takes the right decisions for the public.

Looking ahead, more than three quarter (78%) have no confidence in the future of local services, with 50% thinking of quitting their post for a less stressful job.

The party wants David Davis to face MSPs on the Scottish Parliament\u0027s Europe Committee amid a row over the UK Government\u0027s handling of the EU Withdrawal Bill.  Mr Davis has been asked to give evidence to the committee on several occasions, but is yet to do so.  The SNP was left outraged last week when amendments to the legislation affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate in the House of Commons.  The Scottish Parliament had already voted against granting formal consent to the Bill.  The SNP said the move effectively turned \"on its head\" the Sewel convention, the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters, and called for Scottish Secretary David Mundell to resign.  The opposition to the legislation stems from concerns Holyrood\u0027s powers could be constrained as a result of the legislation, with some of the responsibilities returning from Brussels going to UK ministers instead of those in Edinburgh.  SNP MSP and Europe Committee member Mairi Gougeon said: \"The Tories are tearing up the devolution settlement before our eyes. But we cannot allow them to get away with it.  \"It\u0027s now abundantly clear that David Mundell has failed Scotland in the Cabinet, and people have seen through his excuses and bluster.  \"It\u0027s now imperative that the UK government explains how it will navigate the unfolding constitutional crisis, and it\u0027s clear that the Secretary of State for Scotland isn\u0027t up to that job.  \"David Davis, the man behind Westminster\u0027s Brexit agenda and its severe implications for Scotland, has many questions to answer.\""},{"url":null,"title":"DUP  39 s Arlene Foster to attend LGBT event for the first time","story":"              Arlene Foster\u0027s decision to attend an LGBT event in Northern Ireland next week represents an important step towards dialogue, the organisers said.  The PinkNews reception at the seat of Northern Ireland\u0027s suspended devolved parliament at Stormont will be held on June 28.  Campaigners said it was the first time a DUP leader had agreed to take part in such an occasion.  The country is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not available.  Change is strongly opposed by Democratic Unionists, who argue that civil partnerships are already available and believe marriage is between a man and a woman.  Benjamin Cohen, chief executive and editor-in-chief at PinkNews, said: \"The decision by Arlene Foster to attend the first PinkNews event in Belfast is an important step towards encouraging a dialogue in Northern Ireland and we\u0027re delighted that there will be a number of other senior cross-party representatives attending and speaking.\"  Political powersharing has been suspended in Northern Ireland for months, with Sinn Fein raising identity and rights issues such as same-sex marriage as key matters to be addressed in negotiations.  Mrs Foster recently met members of the Fermanagh Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and the Muslim community as part of a series of gestures aimed towards greater inclusivity.  She said: \"I intend to accept that invitation to demonstrate my acknowledgement of that contribution and to recognise the reality of diversity among our citizens.  \"For me I believe I can hold to my principled position, particularly in reality to the definition of marriage, whilst respecting the diversity across our society and recognising that sexuality is a matter for the individual.  \"All I ask in return is that my, and our views, are also respected and not the subject of the vilest of abuse as has sometimes been the case by a small minority.\"  Mrs Foster said her party was not changing its position on marriage but reaching out to acknowledge the contribution made by a section of the community.  \"Just because we disagree on marriage does not mean that I can\u0027t say that we value those who are LGBT in our society and they should not be the subject of hate because of their sexuality.  \"Remember, everyone is equal under the law and equally subject to the law.\"  She said unionism stood for pluralism and multiculturalism.  \"We must be inclusive and welcome all, recognising they bring added value to a broader and greater overall sum.  \"I want to genuinely reach out to our minority communities and show them the hand of friendship, recognising they have made Northern Ireland their home.  \"If we truly believe in equality of opportunity for all in Northern Ireland, then we must respectfully engage and reach out to those who perhaps have not always been respectful of our position.

The Scottish Information Commissioner revealed last week that ministers had run a secret two-tier FoI system, making it harder for those most likely to embarrass them.  Requests from the media, MSPs and their researchers faced extra scrutiny, despite the law saying the FoI process should be blind, and each request judged solely on its merits.  The government last week accepted the Commissioner\u0026rsquos report in full and agreed to overhaul its procedure to stop taking into account the identity of requesters.  Ahead of a Holyrood debate on transparency tomorrow, Labour will ask MSPs to back \u0026ldquoan independent review of both FoI handling and the recording of information from meetings.  MSP Rhoda Grant said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Information Commissioner\u0026rsquos damning report reveals repeated attempts by the SNP government to bury bad news.  \u0026ldquoNot only was the clearance process different, but there is some evidence that information was suppressed in answer to these journalists\u0026rsquo requests.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP has so far failed to recognise the seriousness of this unacceptable behaviour and properly take responsibility for it.  \u0026ldquoThat is why Scottish Labour is demanding a full investigation into the SNP\u0027s handling of FOI requests.  \u0026ldquoAnything less would only show that the SNP government simply cannot be trusted.  Meanwhile, the Scottish Liberal Democrats demanded that FoI should be extended to big private contractors delivering public services.  MSP Tavish Scott said ScotRail and the failed contractor Carillion were examples of companies where was a clear public interest in greater transparency.  A survey by the Scottish Information Commissioner found four-fifths of Scots thought organisations building and maintaining schools and hospitals should be subject to FoI.  The government currently spends around \u0026pound11bn a year procuring public services.  Mr Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe public are left with little recourse to uncover how taxpayers\u0027 money is being spent and what level of performance is being achieved.  \u0026ldquoThey want to know whether the contractors maintaining our roads or running our railways and prisons are doing a good job.  \"Some of these firms are vast behemoths handling as much public money as a government department or council, so this is a crucial step to making these firms accountable.\"  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoScotland already has the most open, far-reaching freedom of information laws in the UK \u0026ndash we are working to widen the coverage even further and welcome all suggestions as to how that can be done.  \u0026ldquoLegislation has previously been expanded to a range of arm\u0026rsquos-length-organisations providing cultural, leisure and sporting services on behalf of local authorities, private prison contractors, providers of secure accommodation to children and young people, and grant-aided and independent special schools.  \"An order to extend FOISA to Registered Social Landlords is currently under consideration.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to assess options to further expand coverage, and whether other private companies exercising public functions should be brought within scope."},{"url":null,"title":"Producer behind Oscar-nominated film The Lobster named director of Screen Unit","story":"              A FILM executive who has worked on a series of award-winning films is to lead Scotland\u0027s new screen funding body.

A panel of banking executives told Holyrood\u0027s Economy Committee that pre-consultation with customers was not a factor in the decision-making process.  MSPs have been examining the impact of bank closures in the wake of RBS\u0027 decision to shut at least 52 branches across the country, with a further 10 under review.  SNP MSP Gillian Martin quizzed the panel on whether they held any consultation with customers and communities before taking the decision to shut a branch.  Susan Allen, head of customer interactions at Santander UK, said: \"We don\u0027t do formal consultation with customers before any closures.  \"We fully adhere to the access to banking standards as you would expect. The other thing we do take into account in making our decisions is representations reps from our own local teams.\"  Robin Bulloch, managing director at Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland, said: \"We don\u0027t consult formally as has been said already its not a requirement of the standard.  \"I would be concerned with a pre-consultation creating quite a high degree of uncertainty for customers and colleagues about the possible outcome.\"  Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS, said: \"There is no structured customer consultation... but we do look at what our customers actually do, where they bank and how they bank before we take any decision.  \"On the issue of consultation... it is difficult to know where that would start and stop, so there is a practical issue with that.  \"The approach we take to look at what customers are actually doing, how can we best support them and what alternatives are available, is a sound basis.  \"I think the way that we all go about it at the moment is very similar and I think it\u0027s very difficult to see how a consultation reaches a different or better decision.\"  Mr Watson was rebuked by Labour MSP Jackie Baillie for failing to provide information requested by the committee on the number of RBS bank branches now as compared to 2010.  She cited two examples - in Alexandria and Arrochar - where local communities had been left without facilities following an RBS closure.  Ms Baillie said: \"You said that when a bank closes you wanted to leave something behind in the community. What did you leave behind in Alexandria?  \"Given you talk about it wouldn\u0027t be a closure and then nothing, it felt like a closure and then nothing in Arrochar.\"  Mr Watson responded: \"If we\u0027ve fallen short on that occasion then I\u0027m very sorry, I\u0027m very happy to continue the discussion about Alexandria and the specifics.  \"We always try to deliver on our promises and commitments and if we didn\u0027t in that case then I\u0027m very sorry.  \"There\u0027s any number of options we could look at, there are individual circumstances in some communities where it might take us longer to do that but I\u0027m not aware of where there\u0027s been anything where we\u0027ve not been able to provide some kind of suitable alternative and I\u0027m very happy to take up the specific case of Arrochar.\"  He told the committee an independent reviewer had been appointed to review the future of the 10 RBS branches offered a reprieve, with further details to be announced in the coming days."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils to benefit from new mentoring scheme","story":"\t\t\t\tMCR Pathways\u0026rsquo Young Scottish Talent initiative will be available to support disadvantaged and care-experienced pupils at St Machar, Banff, Inverurie, Fraserburgh and Peterhead Academies, as well as The Gordon Schools from August.                                                    The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm.

Tain is my home town and I care about it \u0026ndash and the same is true of the other communities that I have the honour to represent.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Sailor in distress proves false alarm","story":"A lifeboat rushed into action on Friday night after a yacht was\u0026nbspreported to be in trouble in the Pentland Firth.A boat was launched from Scrabster, but on nearing the 30-foot vessel\u0026nbspthe RNLI crew ascertained that the sailor \u0026ndash on his way home to Denmark\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash was not in any danger.\u0026ldquoHe was fine, but he\u0026rsquod been struggling with the tides to get through and that was all, said Andy Pearson, the station\u0027s full time mechanic.\u0026ldquoSomebody had obviously seen him dodging through the tides trying to make his way through the Firth, and he was using his experience to get through.Pearson said that the lifeboat stayed with the man \u0026ndash described as \u0026ldquoquite an old experienced sea dog \u0026ndash to make sure he negotiated the Skerries safely.\u0026ldquoSomeone filed a report with good intent and it\u0026rsquos good for us to go out and check that they are ok, he underlined.Thurso is the most northerly RNLI lifeboat station on mainland Scotland.Crews of the Scrabster station\u0026rsquos Severn class all-weather lifeboat have received 17 awards for gallantry.Pearson said that the man was not planning on stopping before sailing across the North Sea to Denmark \u0026ndash a distance of around 450 nautical miles.He stressed that any small vessel low in power should monitor what the tides are doing before they try and negotiate the Firth.\u0026nbspTuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114264.jpg","title":"Special delivery for retiring Lybster postie","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe started in 1988, taking over from another postie who was a familiar figure to a certain generation, Donnie Bremner from Mid-Clyth.Thirty years ago Murray had to go over the Ord to Helmsdale to meet the train north to collect the mail then take it to the local sorting offices in Dunbeath and Lybster. All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04109000/04109865.jpg","title":"Wick museum set for another busy year","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIan Leith, chairman of the Wick Society, made the plea after being re-elected to the post at the annual general meeting on Thursday night.\u0026ldquoIn the open season last year we had in excess of 5000 people, which was a good bit up on previous years, and this year looks as though it\u0026rsquos heading very much the same way, Mr Leith said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos busy, with a lot of tourists coming in. We\u0026rsquore getting a lot of Australians in at the moment.\u0026ldquoOne thing we would like to get more of is local people. It\u0026rsquos great that we get these visitors from all over the world, and many of them have Caithness connections and they come on that basis, but it would be nice to get more local people.\u0026ldquoOur open day on January 2 was a good start in that respect because it opened the door to people from the local area to come and see what we have.\u0026ldquoA number have come back on the basis of that.\u0026ldquoThe local people are very supportive of the Wick Society. Everything in this museum is donated by people who either live locally or have connections with this place.\u0026ldquoI mentioned at the AGM about the amount of donations that we get in monetary terms. That\u0026rsquos considerable, from local businesses and local people. Some of those are also in-kind donations, certainly in terms of the boat section \u0026ndash they get quite a lot of in-kind help from businesses around the harbour.\u0026ldquoSo, while we would like more local people to come in through our doors and appreciate what we\u0026rsquove got here, it\u0026rsquos not a criticism of the local people because they are very, very supportive.He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an honour to be part of the Wick Society and to be part of its development.\u0026ldquoWe have a number of plans in place for things we want to do.

I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 19, 2018 at 9:00 amNine Orkney food and drink businesses will be flying the flag for the islands at this week’s Royal Highland Show.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
