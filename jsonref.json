ordered his Labour government never to discuss in public the supposed ‘advantages’ of the unprecedented influx.But behind the scenes ministers were instructed to wave tens of thousands of asylum seekers into the UK under cover of their being ‘economic migrants’.Astonishingly, the minister Mr Blair put in charge of borders ruled against deporting failed claimants because it would be too ‘emotional’. In March this year, Mr Bower released his unauthorised biography on Prince Charles called Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and Defiance of Prince Charles.He claimed it would include

Sexist producers or feeble women who lack the confidence and guts to compete? Nowhere is this more striking than on topical panel shows like Have I got News For You - just starting its 55th series.From the very beginning, the teams have been hosted by writer and satirist Ian Hislop and comedian Paul Merton. Hislop is cheery, consistently snappy and savage with his put-downs, Merton lugubrious and surreal.There have been regular complaints from the start that the show is a boy’s club, where women don’t feel at ease and some women were highly offended this week when Hislop remarked that female MP’s were reluctant to host the show- there has only been one, Anne Widdecombe.Ten male MP’s have occupied the hot seat, including Boris Johnson, Ed Balls and Nick Clegg. I was unlucky to be a panellist on the show with Ed - he made the fatal mistake of thinking he was a comedian, instead of accepting the task was to read out a script and not mess it up.Possibly his success on Strictly had over-inflated his ego, but the result was painful in the extreme.Would I have done a better job? Most definitely - but I’m not interested in maintaining order and having to appear neutral, I prefer to be an irritant and spar with the others.          There have been regular complaints from the start that the show is a boy’s club, where women don’t feel at ease           Jo Brand (who demolished the cocky blokes with some withering putdowns)Hislop is not a chauvinist but a surprising well-balanced fellow, who had the guts to say ‘women are slightly more reticent…maybe modesty makes them think ‘I can’t do that…maybe more men in public life think ‘Yes I can do that’.Politically incorrect it might be, but Hislop articulates what the scientists now tell us - men have no problem thinking they can be achievers, when they often possess minimal skills for the job.What a feeble bunch most female MP’s turn out to be - Nadine Dorries (not a shrinking violet) says she will never appear on HIGNFY again because it’s ‘too vicious, too abrasive’ adding ‘women don’t banter in that way, or very rarely…most don’t have that degree of aggression’.Compared with the Bill Clinton and Monica scandal the seedy...Share this articleTalk about condemning your own sex to mediocrity in the space of a couple of sentences, and a bit rich coming from someone who regularly takes part in the antiquated bear pit that’s the House of Commons debating chamber, where grown men shout, make silly gestures and animal noises and interrupt each other, in the name of democracy.Margaret Beckett, now in the House of Lords whimpered ‘they eat people alive who think they can compete’. These women are a disgrace to their sex - Beckett did herself no favours when she appeared on Question Time around the start of the MP’s expenses scandal, and tried to justify all her various houses and living expenses. She was mocked by a rowdy audience and failed to fight back, spineless outside her comfort zone.

As for allegations of sexism, the producers of HIGNFY will be under enormous pressure to book more women - after the BBC launched a target of 5050 gender representation.Comedy shows are about entertainment, and if a guest (male or female) can’t deliver they won’t be asked back.I am frequently asked to appear on popular television shows by casting directors, and I know why. It’s hardly flattering, because they are ticking boxes. They will be tasked with booking the following - a young soap star, an actor who’s had ‘problems’ (either booze or drugs) and is turning their life around, an airhead reality star, a sportsperson of yesteryear and a couple of old farts who will complain and argue. Each component is chosen to appeal to a certain demographic in the audience, from brain-dead youth to frisky pensioner.Every single reality show, from The Island to Strictly, to I’m a Celebrity and Real Marigold Hotel follows these highly structured guidelines - so you get me or Anne Widdecombe or John Sargeant or Miriam Margolyes in the ill-tempered crumblie slot. Thankfully, Have I got News is one show where these rules don’t apply. You need to be smart, alert, self-deprecating and careful not to annoy your team leader. What’s not to like?One feminist writer whinged that women don’t want to appear because ‘they see how they are dealt with’. Sure, there have been some gormless silent bimbos on the show, but there have also been useless tongue-tied men.Is it beyond the wit of smart women to mount a take-over of prime time telly?

He claimed: \u0027High Commissioners are required to watch the visit from a minstrels\u0027 gallery. They complain about being \u0027ushered around like cattle\u0027.\u0027          According to Mr Venuprasad, he warned Baroness Scotland about organising a £500,000 garden party which he claims \u0027marked him out\u0027Mr Venuprasad claims three days before the baroness officially arrived in her job, he was told \u0027Team Scotland\u0027 required office space for at least six people, potentially dislodging existing staff. On her first day \u0027she tells staff \u0027I am the Secretariat\u0027 and all staff are \u0027mini -mes\u0027,\u0027 he said.Mr Venuprasad says he warned about Baroness Scotland organising a £50,000 garden party, expressing concerns about \u0027the cost, invitation list, timing and absence of Secretariat staff\u0027.He told the tribunal: \u0027As a result of making the disclosures I was immediately marked out … by the secretary general as being the source of a leak when adverse reports about her were published in the UK Press.\u0027I was then subjected to a campaign of intimidation and hostility clearly designed not only to punish me, but to damage me reputationally and psychologically.\u0027I deny in the most strenuous terms that I leaked sensitive and confidential information to the Press.\u0027Mr Venuprasad claims he was treated as the sole suspect for the leaks but it could not be proved so he was suspended, given a final written warning, and effectively pushed out for a bogus offence of forwarding work emails to his private email address.He claims he would otherwise have worked as a \u0027high performer\u0027 for six more years. He wants compensation that could approach £500,000.Mr Venuprasad said: \u0027A Secretariat spokesperson described me to the media, on the record, as \u0027a profoundly disaffected inidual\u0027. This description had therefore been sanctioned, probably at the highest levels.\u0027Queen snubs\u0027 Baroness Shameless: Monarch said to be staying...Pressure mounts on Baroness Brazen as her PR advisor is...Share this article\u0027I had been told that the SG was threatening to report me to police regarding my previous employment. My career was in tatters.\u0027 He said he was falsely accused of corruption.The Secretariat\u0027s lawyer, Alice Lacourt, said the baroness denied smearing Mr Venuprasad behind his back.Tribunal chairman David Goddard QC said: \u0027Why can\u0027t the secretary general say that? … It is unusual not to have evidence from the people who made the decisions.\u0027Mrs Lacourt said it was not felt necessary to call the baroness to give evidence to deny she had smeared Mr Venuprasad because there was no direct evidence that she had.An official Secretariat spokesman later said it was the \u0027busiest\u0027 time of year for the secretary general who had been in Australia all week for the Commonwealth Games, meetings and conferences.The tribunal findings will be announced at a later date. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/06/01/4ADDE3FE00000578-5584017-image-a-1_1522974745350.jpg","title":"Beast East hits high street sales","story":"A dusting of snow covers Guildford High Street.Year-on-year sales dropped by 10.1 per cent for March, according to BDO\u0027s High Street Sales Tracker (HSST)          The news is likely to be little better looking ahead to April, with the tracker reporting flat growth for the week leading up to Easter Sunday amid a weekend of wet weather.

He describes himself as a \u0027media and cultural theorist who specialises in research on playful media, from videogames and social media to activist and art projects\u0027.Then there is Ruth Catlow who is not even connected to an academic institution but is listed as a director of Furtherfield, an \u0027artist led online community\u0027. With a degree in sculpture, Ms Catlow describes herself as an \u0027artist, theorist, curator,\u0027 and a \u0027recovering web-utopian\u0027, whatever that is.Meanwhile, Zeta Kolokythopoulu, who is listed by the Guardian as being at London South Bank University, is not known there as a member of its staff. A separate website suggests she may be a PhD student.There will have been little surprise at the pro-Corbyn views advanced by another inidual who put his name to the letter: Jeremy Gilbert, the professor of cultural and political theory at East London University.In his biography, Gilbert boasts he writes regularly for the Guardian as well as the Left-leaning New Statesman, and that he has appeared on national TV \u0027as a spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s leadership of the Labour Party\u0027.In its news coverage of the letter, the Guardian skated over that admission as well as the fact he is a \u0027member of the founding national committee of Momentum\u0027, the group set up in 2015 to shore-up Corbyn\u0027s leadership of Labour.The shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a self-confessed Marxist, will have been delighted by the inclusion of Theodore Koulouris on the list. A \u0027senior lecturer in media theory\u0027 at Brighton University, his work is described thus: \u0027His research interests lie in the interstices of media and literary theory with a focus on the intersections of Marxism with deconstruction, on the political significances of mourning, on media ethics, and on literary and socio-political articulations of feminism, gender performativity, and feminist activism in the digital era.\u0027          Protesters hold placards as they demonstrate in Parliament Square against anti-SemitismAnother of the letter\u0027s authors, Michael Chanan, professor of film at Roehampton University, is proud to state he is the \u0027New Statesman magazine\u0027s first video blogger\u0027.Hacked Off, the lobbyist group seeking to muzzle the Press, is inevitably involved. Julian Petley, Professor of Journalism at Brunel University, a supporter of the group, signed the letter.A member of the editorial board of the British Journalism Review which over the years has been hijacked by the Left, he has been a full-time academic for 26 years.None of these academics is from Oxford or Cambridge. In fact only one of them, Bart Cammaerts of the London School of Economics, comes from one of our top ten universities. And he is an associate professor in the Department of Media and Communications who is currently on sabbatical.There are several signatories from Goldsmiths, University of London, and the less well-known universities of Aston and Lincoln.The fact is that even a cursory glance at the list reveals these people – 18 of whom are from media journalism and communciations departments – are anything but the senior academics they were claimed to be (and God help our universities if they are!)So why has the Labour-supporting Guardian exaggerated their status? Could it be down to the influence of Corbyn\u0027s all-powerful communications chief Seumas Milne? He is a former columnist on the newspaper. He also happens to be an old colleague of Becky Gardiner, who signed the letter in her capacity as senior lecturer in media and communications at Goldsmiths University.What the letter did not make clear is that she worked for 14 years on the newspaper and was comment editor when Milne was a columnist between 2010 and 2014. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/04/04/21/wire-2640414-1522872749-887_87x84.jpg","title":"Israel Hamas gear Gaza border showdown","story":""},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/06/07/4ADF122700000578-5584769-image-a-49_1522995302691.jpg","title":"Gold Coast Candyman looking new attractive girlfriend apply now","story":"    Travers \u0027Candyman\u0027 Beynon (centre) is looking for an \u0027extremely attractive\u0027 woman to call his luxurious waterfront mansion home along with his wife and girlfriends (pictured)          The 46-year-old (second left), who is a father-of-four, has opened his doors for five girlfriends to cook his breakfast and pose in half-naked photos - as in any \u0027genuine relationship\u0027          Australia\u0027s Hugh Hefner wants his five new girlfriends to \u0027explore and experiment beyond their wildest fantasies\u0027 (pictured)\u0027With a custom bed built for a King, five more girlfriends can fit ... the search is on,\u0027 Beynon told The Sun.\u0027I want my girlfriends to develop, explore and experiment beyond their wildest fantasies.\u0027 The tobacco tycoon, who helped his parents create Free Choice, wants a \u0027fun, bubbly, outgoing, spontaneous, adventurous and respectful\u0027 lover to start a \u0027genuine relationship\u0027 with.What\u0027s wrong with this picture?

He’s got a very busy schedule I imagine.Asked why Harry seems so at ease with the competitors, he replied: I think it’s because he’s around military people. It’s hard to explain if you haven’t served. I think that’s why he’s so comfortable, he’s around like-minded people.After meeting Meghan for the first time he said: “She was lovely, like you see on the TV. Very polite and humble, so just great.

She was cool, really cool, just like I imagined.Mr Ormrod, who lost both legs and an arm to an IED in Helmand Province in 2007, said he would be watching their big day on TV.He said: “We will be at home glued to the box watching it and wishing them all the best not just on the day but for their future together.

That makes him a lot different.“I couldn’t imagine living the life he has and having that of normality and being able to do that, he must be really grateful for that. We all just look in on that and are happy for him.Speaking about the surge in applications to compete at this year\u0027s Games, he said: I love it, the buzz is even bigger this year. It’s crazy. They’ve included the families now in the trial process as well, which is really important.‘The buzz is just great.

Critics of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s pledge to scrap tuition fees say it would be unsustainable and would lead to funding shortages\u0027The very idea that anyone would see them as having it easy is deeply unfair and misunderstands the challenge that young people today face in their lives.\u0027It\u0027s a mistake to look at the younger generation and think they\u0027ve had it all easy but that is the mistake that a lot of older generations quite easily make and we shouldn\u0027t fall into that trap.\u0027Life is far from cushy for young people.\u0027Critics of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s pledge to scrap tuition fees say it would be unsustainable and would lead to funding shortages.The Tories say students must make some contribution towards their education if the number attending university is to remain uncapped.Experts have said abolishing fees would result in fewer disadvantaged people attending since the taxpayer would only be able to fund a limited number.The increased repayment threshold applies to any student who has taken out a post-2012 undergraduate student loan or Advanced Learner Loan.Graduates living in the UK will not be required to take action in order to receive the saving.

However, all Moslem religious leaders are proud of this fact.\u0027           A study came out in 2008 from Burke\u0027s Peerage suggesting the Queen\u0027s connection to the Prophet Muhammad (pictured above, thousands of Muslims circle the Kaaba inside the Grand Mosque in Mecca) A study came out in 2008 from  Burke\u0027s Peerage suggesting the Queen\u0027s connection to the Prophet Muhammad. It claimed the Queen descends from a Muslim princess called Zaida, who fled her home town of Seville in the 11th century before converting to Christianity.Muhammad Ali\u0027s robe from his 1965 rematch with Sonny Liston...\u0027Don\u0027t believe that c**p!\u0027 Prince Charles turns the air blue...Share this articleZaida was the fourth wife of King Al-Mu\u0027tamid ibn Abbad of Seville.

Some historians believe she was the daughter of a wine-drinking caliph descended from the Prophet. Others say she married into his family.           The reaction to the Queen\u0027s reported links to the Prophet have been mixed (pictured above, the Queen greets Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia earlier this year) The reaction to the Queen\u0027s reported links to the Prophet have been mixed.Abdelhamid Al-Auouni welcomed the news in his piece in Moroccan newspaper Al-Ousboue, writing: \u0027It builds a bridge between our two religions and kingdoms.\u0027Meanwhile a tongue-in-cheek headline on the Arab Atheist Network\u0027s web forum read: \u0027Queen Elizabeth must claim her right to rule Muslims.\u0027 One person on internet forum Reddit rubbished the claims however, writing: \u0027This is just propaganda used by the British monarchy to appease the growing number of Muslim subjects.\u0027Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/05/05/4AD2442500000578-0-image-m-44_1522902268361.jpg","title":"Most people believe Earth flat consider religious poll reveals","story":"    A new poll found that 52 per cent of people who believe the Earth is flat consider themselves to be \u0027very religious\u0027 and think evidence of the world\u0027s shape can be found in scripture The data also revealed that 84 per cent of Americans have always believed the Earth is round.

Reed’s effort is snaffled by a bunker at the back he’s lucky his ball rolls back into the middle of the trap, because it was threatening to hang on the downslope, and being shortsided, with water behind, makes it difficult enough.

Bogey for Adam Hadwin, a result of a visit to Mizeland: he’s -2. And up on 12, Henrik Stenson clanks his tee shot into the trees at the back of the green. He gets a lucky break, his ball dropping into a bunker instead of sticking on the bank, but he can’t get up and down: he’s -3 again.Share this postNothing is certain yet, but it looks as though there will only be one amateur competing this weekend. Doug Ghim carded a 76 today, to add to the level-par 72 he posted yesterday. He should easily avoid the cut at +4, unless something very strange occurs. That’ll mean the young Texan, who qualified as runner up at last year’s US Amateur, will automatically win the Silver Cup for lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. The only person who can stop him is the man who staged a comeback from two down with two to play to pip him at that US Amateur: Doc Redman. But he’s +8 overall through 12, and that doesn’t look super-likely.Share this postBefore Bubba can do anything, Stenson chips in from the front of 11! That grabs back the shot he dropped at 10, and he’s -4 again. Bubba can’t guide in his birdie putt, but fair’s fair, that was a decent par save from where he was back up the hole. That approach shot was so entertaining. Meanwhile back on 10, Hadwin, with the tree denying him backswing, stabs up onto the green to a couple of feet. That’s a shot of genius in itself. He saves his par, which is absurd really. Hoffman scrambles from a tight position too. But Reed can’t get up and down from the bunker and drops to -7.Share this postBubba manufactures an astonishing shot from behind a tree down the right of 11. He almost pirouettes on the pine straw as he sends a huge hook round the trunk, guiding the ball down to the green. The water not even a consideration! That’s not quite up there with his famous hook from the trees to win the 2012 play-off with Louis Oosthuizen ... but it’s not far off. He’s left with a 30-footer. I hope he knocks that in for birdie, because that shot was sensational, and deserves reward for sheer chutzpah!Share this postTiger is in serious danger of missing the cut now. He hits a lovely third from the dropzone, to a couple of feet, and will salvage a bogey for the second day in a row. But it’ll drop him to +5, right on the cut line. No room for error, and the outcome may not be in his hands depending on events, unless he starts making a birdie or two. He storms off in a hot funk. Pars for Leishman (-5) and Fleetwood (+1).Share this postTiger dunked his tee shot at 12 into the water yesterday ... and he does exactly the same thing today! He contemplates burying the hosel of his 8-iron into the tee box, but instead opts for some trenchant self-analysis: “Fucking idiot.” Some more comic stylings are played out on 10, as Reed sends his approach into a bunker on the right, Hoffman pulls his left, and Hadwin really loses his left, dropping his club on the follow-through and watching in horror as his ball nestles in front of a large tree. He’ll have little or no backswing to work with there.Share this postTiger, Leishman and Fleetwood all guide brave second shots into 11, caring not a jot about the water on the left. Surely someone will be rewarded with birdie? Nope! They’re +4, -5 and +1 respectively. (Fleetwood’s bid having hit the skids with bogeys at 7, 8 and 10.) Stenson meanwhile pulls his second down the bank to the left of 10. His chip up towards the green snags in the turf. He bumps his next shot to the side of the cup, so the damage is limited to bogey, but that’s the 2016 Open champ back to -3.Share this postA lucky break for Adam Hadwin on 9. His chip into the green has way too much backspin on it, and that’s heading off the steep slope at the front. It should by rights trundle about 50 yards back down the fairway, but somehow it snags on the tight turf and stops. Hadwin still has a job to get up and down, mind, and he bumps up nicely to a couple of feet and tidies up to save his par. Charley Hoffman scrambles par from behind the bunker on the left a fine effort seeing he’d driven into trees down the right. But Patrick Reed creams his second over the flag to 12 feet, and he rolls in the birdie putt. He’s out in 31 strokes, having started out with three birdies in a row, and finished the front nine in similar style. He’s taking charge of this Masters.  Patrick Reed takes charge of the Masters. Photograph: Andrew RedingtonGetty ImagesShare this postBack-to-back birdies for Jason Day at 8 and 9. He’s +1, and heads for the turn with a spring in his step that suggests he doesn’t consider his bid over. Birdie for Bernd Wiesberger on 15: he’s -3. But it’s a bogey for Zach Johnson on 11 he’s back to -1. Here’s Simon McMahon: “I’m now rooting for Sergio to finish in last place. That would be history, of a sort. First to last in the space of a single year. They could give him a green wooden spoon or something. Looks like Harry Ellis will deny him, but if he goes round Amen Corner in six over par, with 15 still to come, it could be back on.” Share this postThe last group of lads are all doing very nicely, thank you. It had been a poor start for Adam Hadwin, with bogeys at 2 and 5. But he’s turned it round with back-to-back birdies at 7 and 8. He’s -3. Charley Hoffman makes his third birdie of the day he’s -5. And it’s three out of three birdies on the par five, as Patrick Reed finds the heart of the green in two, makes two easy putts, and consolidates his position at the top.Share this postRose splits the fairway at 18. If only he could have done that 12 months ago in the play-off, huh. He clips his second to 12 feet. Dustin matches him shot for shot. Only DJ manages to convert for birdie, though. Rose is -2 Dustin -3 both nicely positioned for the weekend.Share this postTiger is clinging on: he rolls in a 15-foot downhill effort on 9 to save his par and remain at +4. Zach Johnson fluffs a pitch at the front of 10, but rolls in a huge par saver to stay at -2. Bubba rolls in a big left-to-right breaker on 8 for his fourth birdie of the day: he’s -2. And Henrik Stenson finds the middle of 8 in two big crashes, rolls the long eagle putt up to a couple of feet, and tidies up for a birdie that moves him to -4.Share this postShare this postJordan Spieth pushes his birdie effort at 18. It was never going in, heading right the second it left the face. Never mind: that’s a fine 74 given he started out 6-6. He’s -4, and will be a big part of this Masters at the weekend. Meanwhile Big Dustin follows up his silly save at 16 with another act of astonishing escapology at 17: a wild drive into the trees down the right, a stab out, then an easy wedge and putt to stay at -2.Share this postPatrick Reed regains the lead. He lands his second at 7 pin high, 15 feet from the flag, and trundles in the birdie putt. He’s -6. Meanwhile up on 18, Jordan Spieth finds the Lyle Bunker with his tee shot ... then hits a Lyle Iron into the green. That’s a wonderful shot, not wholly dissimilar to the 1988-winning strike by our Sandy. He’ll have a great look at a birdie that’d take him to -5 and salvage nearly all of the damage caused at 1 and 2 today.Share this postRory talks to Sky Sports. “It feels OK. I played really well on the back nine. I had chances all the way in. I’m a little frustrated that I’m not in the clubhouse six or seven under par. I left a couple out there. The wind was up, the pin positions were tricky, it was tough to get it close. You have to stay patient around here! There are some six-footers where you have to give it two feet of break. You have to hole your fair share.”  Rory McIlroy chips from among the patrons after hitting into a chair on the seventh. Photograph: Andrew GombertEPAShare this postNo birdie for Tiger on 8: he stays at +4 and continues to exude disappointment. And a fine scrambled par by Jordan Spieth from the front of 17. He remains at -4. “A good chance I would have thought of McIlroy and Spieth playing together tomorrow, maybe even last out,” writes Adam Hirst. “I’ve been wanting this to happen for a couple of years now, those two duking it out at the top of one of these major thingies.” Share this postSome characteristically absurd shenanigans involving Dustin Johnson. His tee shot at 16 is decent enough, 15 feet above the hole. His tapped birdie putt trundles past the cup and 50 feet down the green. Oh Dustin! But you already know what happens next, don’t you. That’s right, he drains the par putt! The patrons go loco. He stays at -2 in the most marvellously ludicrous fashion. His antics manage to obscure a fine two-putt par from his partner Justin Rose from 60 feet.Share this postJustin Thomas hands a shot back, from prime position in the centre of 7 too. His second flies through the green, his chip back doesn’t make it up the hill, and two putts later he’s scribbling a bogey five on his card. He’s level par again. Meanwhile up on 18, McIlroy finds the centre of the green, but can’t tease home his downhill ten-footer. Par, and he’s signing for a decent 71 that moves him to -4 and keeps him very much in the hunt. Incidentally, his playing partner Jon Rahm came back in 32 strokes, after birdies at 11, 13, 15 and 16. After yesterday’s poor 75, the Spaniard is in this Tournament again! He’s -1 overall.  Rory McIlroy reacts on the eighteenth green. Photograph: Jamie SquireGetty ImagesShare this postMatt Kuchar yips at what should be his final putt of the day, and that’s a needless bogey. He’s signing for a 75, having dropped back into the pack at -1. Rickie Fowler signs for a par 72: he’s -2 for the Tournament. Back on 15, Justin Rose clatters a gorgeous second into the heart of 15 a calm two-putt birdie is his prize. He’s -2.Share this postThe in-form Bubba was very quiet yesterday, shooting a bog-standard 73. Today he’s firing on all cylinders: birdies at 2, 3 and now 6 more than offsetting the one dropped shot at the very difficult par-three 4th. He’s -1. On 8, Zach Johnson clips a wedge to a couple of feet, and will surely kick in for a birdie that’ll move the 2007 champ to -3. And up on the last, Phil drops yet another stroke, and smiles thinly as he puts his name to a 79. He’s +5, right on the cut line he’ll be holding his breath for the next three or four hours.Share this postCharley Hoffman likes it round here: a top-ten finish three years ago, a couple of top-3o finishes since. And he’s at it again. After yesterday’s 69, he’s in credit today: bogey at the opening hole, but birdies at 2 and now 5. He moves to -4, just one off the lead - which still includes Marc Leishman, the Aussie having done very well to scramble his par after that wild drive on 7. He got his second to within touching distance of the green, and got up and down to salvage his score. Par for Spieth at 16 par for McIlroy at 17.Share this postTiger hasn’t got moving this afternoon. He sends his second at 7 just off the back, then races his birdie putt a good ten feet past the hole. He knocks in the return to save his par. He stays at +4, on the right side of the projected +5 cut. There are currently 55 players at +5 or better it’s the top 50 and ties, plus players within ten strokes of the lead, who will remain here at the weekend. The margins are slim, unless he can get moving the other way soon. A par five next, though!  Tiger Woods acknowledges the applause on the seventh. Photograph: Patrick SmithGetty ImagesShare this postJordan Spieth’s comeback continues! He finds the heart of 15 in two big blows. His long eagle putt trundles 18 feet past. No worries! He strokes the return straight into the cup, and that’s a birdie that brings him back to -4. Justin Thomas holes one from just off the green at 6: it’s his third birdie of the day already, and he’s -1. Rickie Fowler, having dropped a stroke at 16, picks it up again at 17: he’s -2. And look at the veteran Vijay Singh! The 2000 champion follows up birdie at 8 with another at 10, and the 55-year-old Fijian is right in the mix!Share this postPatrick Reed surrenders sole ownership of the lead. His tee shot at the par-three 4th clattered into the stand on the left he failed to get up and down, and he’s back to -5. He might be handed it back soon, mind, because Marc Leishman has just flayed a wild drive deep into the trees down the right of 7. Meanwhile up on 16, Rory clips his tee shot pin high, and very nearly drains the uphill 25-footer for birdie. He remains at -4, just one off the new lead.Share this postJustin Rose’s putter has betrayed him in the last hour or so. A three-putt on 11, a tiddler yipped at 12, and now a birdie chance from 12 feet passed up at 14. Birdie at 13 is the one bright note in that little run, and it keeps him in good nick at -1. Tony Finau’s in the clubhouse with a 74, incidentally he’s -2, having rescued an average round with birdie at the last.Share this postMcIlroy lags a long putt from the fringe at the back of 15 to a couple of feet. That’s only a par at the par-five, but he’d have settled for that score when he saw his second come hot off the face, and sail dangerously close to the water. He stays a couple off the lead at -4. Meanwhile Tommy Fleetwood continues to amble across Augusta in a very calm and considered fashion: another par, this time at 6, and he’s -2 for both his round today (having birdied 2 and 3) and the Tournament.Share this postHere’s the world number two, the most in-form player right now, Justin Thomas. He posted a very disappointing 74 yesterday, but he’s started very well today, with birdies at 2 and 4 that bring him back to level par for the Tournament. Up on 16, bother for Phil, who sends his tee shot into sand at the back of the green. He’s left with a delicate splash down the putting surface, and having overhit it, is happy to see the fringe stop the ball before it drops into the water. Two putts, and that’s another shot gone. He’s never been the same today since hitting a tree flush on 9. He’s +4, and his dreams of becoming the oldest Master are as good as over already.Share this postTiger managed to get up and down from the sand at 5, after all that hassle in the bushes. He’s limited the damage to a double bogey, and drops to +4. Meanwhile up on 15, Rory sends his second through the green and flirts with the water at the back. His ball stops on the bank, but he’ll have a hell of a chip up. His bump up doesn’t reach the putting surface, but he doesn’t look too upset: if he’d hit that one hot, it’d have been through the green and into the drink on the other side like a shot. Still, he’s left with an up and down from the fringe to save his par.Share this postThanks to Michael. Tomorrow is Moving Day, of course ... rain permitting ... but maybe that qualified as Moving Hour, because a lot of big names made some positive strides at last. Patrick Reed with three birdies in the first three holes, matching the feat of Marc Leishman earlier, to take the lead. A birdie at 13 for Jordan Spieth. Birdie for Zach Johnson at 5. Birdie for his namesake Dustin at 13. Birdie at 13 for Louis Oosthuizen. And a shot picked up by Henrik Stenson at 2.
