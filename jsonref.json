I love the stark nature of the Icelandic landscape and its contrasts. Deltas form from glacial meltwater running down towards the shoreline, picking up silt and different materials along the way to create these ribbon patterns. There’s all sorts of wildlife too – birds, beautiful wild horses, seals.So a few years ago after a lot of research, cross-referencing Google Earth with books and photography by others, I took a red eye from New York to Reykjavik. It was kind of funny to take a jumbo jet, have three hours upon landing to rent a car, check into my hotel and nap for 20 minutes and then turn around to meet a pilot and spend the day up in the air again in his homemade plane.You can do all the research you want for these projects, but nothing compares to actually seeing things in person. Being in an airplane above that landscape was really magical. Emotional, even.At first, when you’re flying around in a tiny plane, opening the door and hanging out to take pictures, it’s a little nerve-wracking. You see your life flash before your eyes. But I’ve become quite comfortable doing it and am able to be extremely focused.We were looking for the birds – they are Arctic tern, or sea swallows. They are small and quite difficult to spot. But we found this flock circling very fast. We were flying above them at a safe distance. I’ve come to realise animals are actually not that intimidated by planes. There have been countless times we have been flying over flamingos or buck, seals, turtles, 100 feet above them – which is really quite low – and they just could not have cared less. .I knew exactly which terrain I wanted to capture the tern flying over: that patterning of white pebbles against the black sand. We circled several times until finally they lined up as perfectly as I could have asked for and I was able to get several shots.I started working in this way in 2009. I had just finished a two-week commercial job in Botswana and had a couple of extra days to kick around the area. Somebody knew a bush pilot who had his own plane and said: “This guy wants something to do.” On a whim, I said, “Sure, that’d be fun.” I had seen the world from 30,000 feet up, but this was completely different – we were in this ultra light aircraft, flying low over a vast mud flat. When it rained, the water would pick up dirt and silt. And when it dried it created really interesting patterns, things I wouldn’t have been able to see if we’d been flying even just a couple of thousand feet higher. It was an incredible experience and set me off on this path.What attracts me to aerial photography is that point, at a certain elevation, where the line between abstraction and reality blurs. I never show the horizon because it’s an obvious giveaway, a point of reference. I want to create an image that works on multiple levels and at multiple distances. Some aerial photography looks like it could be a landscape, or something that you’re seeing under a microscope. I want you to know this was taken from the air.Animals are a good focal point. They’re recognisable, although I’m often showing them from a point of view people aren’t familiar with. Here, it’s a bit like a layer cake, you have the flat earth, the birds flying above it, and you’re above it all. I like playing with the way the lens flattens this multi-level, three-dimensional space – the sense of scale, the textures, the distance.The fact that I’m moving through the same space as the birds is one part of the story that the image doesn’t tell,. But it is important for me. Everything is at play, the movement of the ocean, the implied movement of the birds. There’s a connectedness between the living and the moving, to make a beautiful, harmonious image.Training: Photojournalism at the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University.Influences: Jackson Pollock and Joan Miró.High point: “The shoot I did in South Africa in 2016: we covered about 2000 miles of ground, 45 hours of flying, in a week, never knowing where we would eat that day or sleep that night, landing on remote airstrips, following wildlife from tips from people we would meet along the way. It was a real adventure.”Low point: “Any time I’m not working.”Top tip: “Work your ass off. To be successful you have to put in a tremendous amount of hard work and not give up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f43bf89989ed97632e6668367e124dc6620dc15/354_2678_3390_2034/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca4e359b53c71711d30eda7487d057c6","title":"goodbye alan moore the king of comics bows out","story":"The pioneer of serious superheroes – who is retiring – has transformed the genre over 40 years of rebellious inventionOne of the most significant fiction writers in English is retiring, to the greatest fanfare of his singular and titanically influential career. Alan Moore has promised that the (extremely late) final issue of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be his last comic, and his final contribution to an art form he utterly transformed, sometimes to his chagrin. His work in the 1980s on Miracleman, a deconstruction of the superhero myth, inspired so many imitators to darken formerly kid-friendly heroes that Moore has apologised more than once for it.This dystopian graphic novel continues to be relevant even 30 years after it ended. With its warnings against fascism, white supremacy and the horrors of a police state, V for Vendetta follows one woman and a revolutionary anarchist on a campaign to challenge and change the world.\u0026nbspMoore\u0027s quintessential Superman story. Though it has not aged as well as some of his work, this comic is still one of the best Man of Steel stories ever written, and one of the most memorable comics in DC\u0027s canon.This introspective, stream-of-consciousness comic follows a successful ad man who begins to have a midlife crisis after realising the moral failings of his life and work.A love letter to the silver age of comics that nods to Buck Rogers and other classics of pulp fiction. Tom Strong embodies all of the ideals Moore holds for what a superhero should be.One of Moore\u0027s best known comic series, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the ultimate in crossover works, drawing on characters from all across the literary world who are on a mission to save it.\u0026nbspMoore draws very rarely, instead he writes comics scripts, and at punishing length. Those can run to hundreds of pages, describing every layer of background and every tertiary character. The scripts themselves, occasionally enclosed in deluxe editions of his work, are as detailed as David Foster Wallace novels. Describing Batman’s home city to artist Brian Bolland in the script for The Killing Joke, Moore wrote: “The lower and seedier levels of Gotham are more inclined towards a territory somewhere between David Lynch and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, all patches of rust and mould and hissing steam and damp, glistening alleyways. I imagine this strip as having an oppressively dark film noir feel to it, with a lot of unpleasantly tangible textures, such as you habitually render so delightfully, to give the whole thing a really intense feeling of palpable unease and craziness.” And Moore’s collaborators have always risen to his challenges, turning this overwriting into eye-popping set pieces.Before Moore, and the likes of Frank Miller, Dave Sim and the Hernandez brothers, the idea that serialised comics could amount to literature was laughable, and that adults could enjoy them without irony creepy. But Moore has had a preternatural grasp of the intricacies of a genre – superheroes – widely considered to be devoid of them.He asked troubling questions of superheroes, who had always appeared in stories that retroactively rewrote themselves and seemed to go on forever. Where was the end of these stories? Had we fully understood their beginnings? Was heroism even possible? The fates of silly costumed heroes became urgent in his hands: Krypto the Super-Dog, the shambling bog-monster Swamp Thing, a kid flying ace named Jetlad – each of these characters has moved me to tears.Moore can be tiresome – his digressions into the minutiae of Kabbalah in his Wonder Woman-style fantasy comic Promethea are insufferable – but he could also be delightful. Top 10, his affectionate send-up of cop shows, was a riot of sight gags, rendered by artists Gene Ha and Zander Cannon. Parody and melodrama keep close company in his work, especially in what is arguably his masterpiece: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, created with the brilliant artist Kevin O’Neill. One character murders another with his magic penis at one point. It’s quite moving.This lurid streak can make Moore a tough sell. One Swamp Thing features an issue-length sex scene in which one participant is a plant yet the books’ central relationship hinges on the idea that Swamp Thing is the best man a woman could hope for, despite – or perhaps because of – his plant-ness.Moore as the saviour of superheroes is ironic in many ways. For one, his work suggests that they are at best feckless and at worst possibly fascis. For another, the process of working with DC Comics, which published his work during his two great fertile periods in the mid-80s and late 90s, so embittered him to the industry that he has often repudiated his own work on corporate superheroes, just as it acquired pop cultural success: video games, action figures, spin-offs. Recently asked about the real-world political influence of V for Vendetta, he was characteristically blunt: “From my position, if I have had one of my ideas stolen from me and turned into yet another cash-generator for some abhuman corporation, then if it has at least escaped into the wild sufficiently to be of some symbolic use to today’s protest movements, that makes me feel a lot better about having written it in the first place.”At the heart of this antipathy is DC’s hold on the legal rights to his co-creations Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Moore and Gibbons were promised that all rights would return to them when Watchmen went out of print, but it never did. Gibbons accidentally predicted what would happen in this arrangement back in 1986. “What would be horrendous, and DC could legally do it, would be to have Rorschach crossing over with Batman or something like that, but I’ve got enough faith in them that I don’t think they’d do that,” he told Neil Gaiman in a public interview preserved by the Comics Journal. Moore never got his rights back and DC has spent many years revisiting Watchmen with lucrative anniversary editions, prequels, a movie, the forthcoming TV series and indeed Watchmen II, called Doomsday Clock, a work in progress with script and art by a different creative team. This will merge the fictional world Gibbons and Moore created with the universe shared by Wonder Woman, Superman and Green Lantern. Moore’s efforts outside superheroics, such as From Hell, Lost Girls and A Small Killing, are often cited as proof of his literary worth. But his greatest contribution to English letters isn’t found in his additions to the growing canon of respectable graphic novels – a term Moore has said was invented to allow adults to “validate their continued love of Green Lantern or Spider-Man without appearing in some way emotionally subnormal”. It’s in his dazzling, quixotic overwriting, applied to trashy genre fiction with an ironic, but never cynical quality. This worked wonders on uncomplicated planet-tossers like Superman and Captain Marvel. And when he leaves behind the superhero hijinks, a lot of the fun leaves the writing along with them. Don’t get me wrong, the highbrow books are still brilliant they’re simply not as enjoyable as the pulpy stuff.Moore would be the first to tell you that seriousness isn’t always a virtue, but his was thoroughly transformative. And for many readers, myself among them, it was a great relief to be taken seriously as a reader of something supposedly sub-literate and stupid, to be treated with intelligence and care, and to be introduced to Moore’s rebellious brand of morality: his passionate feminism, his suspicion of authority and wealth, his love of normal people and veneration of togetherness, especially in the face of the hopelessness of the real world. His gifts for cruelty and horror inspired undistinguished competitors to enter the field, but his unexpected gentleness was what kept readers coming back to him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/922db83363405cb92d382df4bf851f539d91dc13/0_91_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbdd1dcce15935a1af2f395d9e14734c","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Good news from Kemster, who is “thoroughly enjoying” Frank Herbert’s Dune:World-building and story telling of the highest order and not the “hard” sci-fi tome I was expecting at all. It does require a certain level of concentration but that is a small price to pay (if any at all) for such a good book.It’s a rare book that moves me deeply, but even rarer than makes me cry, I’m ancient and male. Jokha Alharthi’s Celestial Bodies did just that. If the idea of a book about three sisters in practically medieval Oman in the 1970s sounds oppressive, it’s the opposite. Think of it more like an Ursula le Guin novel set in a dusty planet, it is that remote. The people are instantly recognisable, as they pursue love within a country in transition, one where slavery still exists. There is also a possible murder within the tale, a subtle strand amongst many. Plus an ideal beach read!I recently read and loved Emilia Pine’s Notes to Self, gobbled down in one sitting on a flight from London to Marseille. It made me realise that I very rarely read non-fiction these days, but I used to enjoy essay collections.Meanwhile, greenmill has just finished The Spy And The Traitor by Ben McIntyre:… having bought it on impulse during an airport departure lounge wait. Ripped through it in no time and even though I knew in advance how it turned out, the true story which is a jaw-dropping mix of narrowly avoided Armageddon, double dealing, death defying escapes and almost comical incompetence (mostly by the KGB) kept me turning the pages. Not my usual thing but thoroughly enjoyed it.Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano has engrossed and challenged writeronthestorm:I’ve almost finished Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano - this is one of the bleakest fiction books I’ve read for quite some time. Yet, it is strangely engrossing. The story centres on what happens to people involved with, or connected to, the abduction of two young boys. The immediate aftermath and also the years upon years that follow. It’s a heartbreaking and deeply uncomfortable read not for the faint of heart. This is challenging stuff!This Body’s Not Big Enough for Both Of Us by Edgar Cantero provides some good niche reading, according to pubbore:It’s a comedy thriller starring a private investigator who is actually two siblings in the same body, each controlling one hemisphere of the brain. I’m not sure if Cantero carries off the conceit entirely convincingly, but if you like gleefully tasteless violence and funny one-liners I can recommend it.Finally, Swelter has some tasty provocations from QD Leavis’ Fiction and the Reading Public:I’m enjoying it immensely. Leavis is a militant and unapologetic champion of the “highbrow”: ‘Those novels which have some pretensions to literary merit and can be criticised by serious standards (it is common even in literary circles to fling the epithet ‘highbrow’ at it).’In order to demonstrate the universality of the belief that, in the 1920s and 1930s, the most popular literature is invariably the worst, she quotes Arnold Bennett (Evening Standard July 19th, 1928):‘Nearly all bookish people are snobs, and especially the more enlightened among them. They are apt to assume that if a writer has immense circulation, if he is enjoyed by plain persons, and if he can fill several theatres at once, he cannot possibly be worth reading and merits only indifference and disdain.’Elsewhere she accuses Bennett’s literary column of being one of the forces, along with book-of-the-month clubs, that perpetuate and codify “middlebrow” literature.Nearly all bookish people are snobs? What kind of know-nothing would write that?If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Sources said Debenhams’ lenders remained supportive of the company’s turnaround plans.Debenhams, which employs more than 20,000 staff, is set to close at least 22 of its 166 UK stores in January with the loss of about 4,000 jobs. It has already forced through rent cuts on many others as part of the survival plan approved by creditors.The retailer is close to announcing a new chief executive to replace the former boss Sergio Bucher, who was ousted in April. The board is understood to be considering a shortlist of just two contenders, thought to include Stefaan Vansteenkiste, a turnaround expert and managing director of consulting firm Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal, who was brought in to help the business in April. However, the other candidate is not Superdry and former Co-op boss Euan Sutherland, who had been widely tipped for the job.Debenhams is thought to want the £50m cash buffer to help it trade through Christmas. It could fund a wave of price cuts as the retailer fights for market share in a tough market, according to Sky News, which first reported the fundraising bid.Slower demand for homewares and clothing, driven by low consumer confidence and rising competition online, has combined with higher costs to make life difficult for department stores. House of Fraser, which was bought out of administration by Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct group nearly a year ago, is set to close stores, as are big clothing chains including Arcadia’s Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Evans.Ashley’s Sports Direct lost a bid to win control of Debenhams after investing £150m in the group’s shares, and has fired off a legal challenge against the Debenhams rescue restructuring.The legal challenge is also being supported by a Salford-based landlord owned by the family of property investor Aubrey Weis, which owns six Debenhams properties. Debenhams has already settled a separate challenge from M\u0026ampG, another landlord."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10c311bb3e26eab86c94e02aa1dd8d6d52928a29/0_227_5410_3247/master/5410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67166374281320e0a5509d735969f102","title":"vanished neighbourhoods the areas lost to urban renewal","story":"Some of the world’s most fascinating neighbourhoods from Chicago to Shanghai have been razed by regeneration – and it’s not just the buildings that goThe wave of urban renewal that swept the world in the 20th century gave us inner-city highways, modernist downtown malls and high-rise housing projects. It destroyed countless fine-grained, human-scaled neighbourhoods.We lost more than just physical buildings. Each of these communities contained something less tangible – neighbourhoods like these are ecosystems. They incubate communities and cultures that do not and could not exist elsewhere.Sometimes, as in these 10 that follow, a neighbourhood lives in the memory of the displaced and their descendants, as powerful in death as in life.In 1914, the author Gustav Meyrink wrote a vivid depiction of 16th-century life in Prague’s Jewish quarter, Josefov. His novel Der Golem describes an oppressive labyrinth of ancient, looming houses in which “something malicious seemed to permeate the very bricks”.That was pretty close to the perspective of Prague’s city government at the end of the 19th century. By then, Josefov’s medieval streets had become a dense, erse hub of poor Czechs, immigrants and artisans whose trades had been devastated by factory manufacturing. City authorities, inspired by Georges-Eugène, Baron Haussmann’s recent “renovation” of Paris, saw it as a blight. In December 1896, the Finis Ghetto urban-renewal scheme kicked off with a literal bang, as 45 houses were destroyed by dynamite. With the exception of few religious sites, the entire neighbourhood was destroyed.The razing faced little opposition from Prague’s Jewish residents, many of whom returned after redevelopment – fuelling resentment among the displaced, and contributing to the antisemitic atmosphere that prevailed in the years before the first world war.A neighbourhood within a building, Mecca Flats was built for Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition and by 1910 was home to artists, musicians, white-collar workers and labourers, mostly black, many arrivals in the great migration. The building was one of America’s first luxury apartment houses, oriented around a central atrium that brought the street life of the neighbourhood indoors.By the great depression, it housed more than 1,000 people. The poet Gwendolyn Brooks worked in the building as a peddler in the 1930s, and immortalised it in her 1968 epic poem, In the Mecca, conceiving of it as a cross-section of black American life: “To touch every note in the life of this block-long block-wide building, would be to capsulize the gist of black humanity in general.”The Mecca was acquired by the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1941 tenants, activists and preservationists rallied to save it, but it was replaced with the school’s Crown Hall – a bright slice of modernism, designed in direct opposition to the perceived darkness and decrepitude of the Mecca.St John’s Ward was an aberration in uptight, homogenous 20th-century Toronto. A erse polyglot with a population density approaching that of contemporary central Hong Kong, it was a prototypical arrival city, with Irish, Italian, Jewish, African, Chinese and others establishing their first Canadian beachheads. A 1922 dispatch in the city’s Globe newspaper reported: “Chinese restaurants are filled with negro customers, many of them women, while here and there an occasional white girl can be seen partaking of a meal with either a brown or yellow skinned partner.” Sanitation and overcrowding were the ostensible targets of the reformers who sought to eradicate the Ward, but that nascent multiculturalism was probably as much a target.Redevelopment began in 1946 and continued for decades today, the district is an imposing institutional corridor separating the city’s downtown from the fine-grained neighbourhoods to the west – a few of which, especially Kensington Market and Chinatown, still bear traces of the old Ward.Born in Alabama, Coleman Young’s family moved to Detroit’s Black Bottom in 1923. The future mayor found himself at five years old amid a community of Jewish, Greek, Italian and Irish residents – and a burgeoning black population arriving, as his family did, from the south. (Boxers Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson, both southerners by birth, lived a few doors from one another here in the 1930s.)Young was politicised as a teenager, listening to union workers talk leftist politics in a local barbershop. He found entertainment along the neighbourhood’s commercial spine, Hastings Street, where John Lee Hooker, Della Reese and others found their musical footing in small clubs.As with other renewal projects nationally, the funds to raze the community were in part provided by the federal Housing Act of 1949, which extended broad powers of expropriation to cities. By 1956 much of Hastings Street had been destroyed and replaced by the Chrysler Freeway. Bisected, what remained of the community quickly fell into decline.Late in life, Young would remember the neighbourhood as “a thrilling convergence of people, a wonderfully versatile and self-contained society”.Philip Payton Jr is sometimes referred to as the “father of Harlem” for his work buying properties in Upper Manhattan and renting them to black tenants. In 1905, he began to do the same on West 99th and 98th streets, purchasing several blocks of buildings between Central Park West and Amsterdam Avenue.A Harlem-in-miniature took root here, and half a decade later, it was a tight-knit community that included the composer Will Marion Cook, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, activist James Weldon Johnson, historian Arturo Schomburg and singer Billie Holiday. In 1951, empowered as Detroit was by 1949’s Housing Act, the city declared the district a slum and evicted residents. More than 500 buildings were demolished, replaced by a luxury housing project called Park West Village.The community became one of the lesser known victims of US slum clearance, though no less mourned by its former residents. “There’s a space in my life that’s missing right now because of that move,” former resident Jim Torain told a documentary film crew in 2008.In 1844, Los Angeles councilman and rancher Julian Chavez petitioned for 83 acres (33.5 hectares) of land in what was than a semi-rural district near today’s Echo Park. He got it, and over the following decades three neighbourhood, Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop, developed in the verdant hills north of the city. The mostly Mexican-American residents practised subsistence agriculture and raised livestock, ran their own schools, and lived a semi-agrarian lifestyle – in the shadow of one of the nation’s ascendant boomtowns.By the 1940s, urban renewal made the community a target for redevelopment. Residents’ homes were expropriated, and while they were promised relocation to new public housing, those plans fell apart after Norris Poulson, who believed public housing to be a communist plot, won 1953’s Los Angeles mayoral race.A handful of stragglers waged the years-long Battle of Chavez Ravine against city authorities, but by 1959 the community was destroyed. In 1962, Dodger Stadium was erected on the site.Sophiatown was the Victorian-era brainchild of a real estate investor who in 1897 bought 237 acres of land near Johannesburg, laid out a few tidy streets, and named them after his children and wife. After the city located a sewage disposal plant nearby, his white homebuyers fled, and black residents found an opportunity denied them elsewhere: property ownership.By the 1950s, Sophiatown was the “Chicago of South Africa”, filled with shebeens (speakeasies), incubating musicians and artists. It was a focal point of activity for the African National Congress and a young Nelson Mandela, and a hub of anti-apartheid activism. In Sophiatown Speaks, the poet and former resident Don Mattera declared: “Sophiatown was the antithesis of what they wanted for this country. Sophiatown had the black people – meaning Coloured, Indians, Blacks of all tribes – and the whites living together.”In 1955, its residents were mostly relocated to the township of Soweto, out of the city. The community was bulldozed, reconstructed as a district of tidy bungalows, and renamed, in Afrikaans, Triomf, eventually reverting in 2006 to its original name.The de facto capital of Canada’s eastern provinces, Halifax is proof that urban renewal often exacted as great a toll on small cities as on large ones. In 1969, local planners were aiming to replicate the slum clearance policies of bigger metropolises, and devised a scheme to raze the city’s historic waterfront for an expressway to the suburbs.Protests halted the expressway, but not a massive downtown interchange that wiped out almost 15 blocks and 400 buildings in the city centre. It displaced thousands of mostly poor residents, and severed the city’s working-class North End from its downtown, exacerbating its decline. Many of the displaced were African-Nova Scotian, descendants of some of Canada’s oldest black communities. (The displacement came just a few years after the destruction of Africville, a historic black community at the city’s northern tip.)The interchange was considered a blight almost as soon as it was erected, and will soon be torn down itself, to be replaced by a mixed-use neighbourhood.In the 1950s, a group of itinerant puppeteers settled on the outskirts of Delhi, establishing this vital community of performers. Memorably described in Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children, its thousands of small homes, called jhuggis, were crammed daily with magic shows, music, storytelling, puppetry and performance.But like similar communities, Kathputli lacked sanitation and other amenities by the 2000s, it was targeted by the Delhi Development Authority, which planned an “in-situ rehabilitation” programme. This involved moving residents to a “transit camp”, razing the neighbourhood, and developing a new high-rise district. Nearly 3,000 350-square-foot apartments were to house former residents, with the rest of the land given to market-rate development.Few residents willingly moved, arguing that the community’s survival depended – like Seoul’s Euljiro district – on the irreplaceable particulars of its built environment. The tension came to a head in October 2017 when demolition began, leaving residents fleeing their homes with little notice. Some residents remained, living in the ruins.A visitor to Shanghai in the late 19th century would have found the city dominated by narrow, winding lanes of shikumen, the local equivalent of Britain’s Victorian terraced workers’ housing, or Philadelphia’s miles of rowhouse neighbourhoods. Laoximen is among the most famous of these neighbourhoods, the product of an earlier population boom that saw the city swell with rural residents coming to the fast-growing city, a hub of regional trade.Today, as the city struggles to house its 26.3 million residents, many old neighbourhoods are being targeted. Part of Laoximen has been destroyed, and demolition is imminent for what remains. Shanghai has a better reputation for preservation than many Chinese cities, however, and a few buildings in Laoximen may be retained.“It still breaks your heart every time you see something like Laoximen,” Tina Kanagaratnam of advocacy group Historic Shanghai told the South China Morning Post last year. “You know this whole way of life is not going to continue. But every time we go somewhere else in China and come back, we think, ‘Oh thank God we live in Shanghai’, because there is so much more of this than there is anywhere else.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3c18304db6b10ad7da03485de3d6e53bcd49ec7/0_176_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e556ebb263e30119f2575cfa52176e18","title":"disability benefit reforms tests pip","story":"My disability hasn’t changed – even so, I’m subject to invasive questioning to get the money I need. For many, it’s even worseCan you be lucky if you get something you deserve? I felt lucky last week as I read the letter informing me I’d been awarded personal independence payments (Pip). Like a couple of million other disabled people, for years I’d received Pip’s predecessor, disability living allowance, without any problems in order to pay for the extra costs of my disability – but it was recently reassessed in the name of “welfare reform”.It’s the oddest of things, “welfare reform”. You sit there, opposite a stranger, asked to detail the sort of intimacies you’d be reluctant to share with a lifelong friend. “Are there parts of your body you can’t reach to wash? Which ones?” “How do you put your bra on?” You wonder why exactly such lines of questioning are necessary, or how the tens of pages you filled out for hours beforehand weren’t enough, and then explain, as politely as you can, the extra painkillers it took in order to get dressed for this assessment this morning.The assessor tries – because she is polite and you are lucky she is kind – complimenting you on your nice home, even though you both know you’d like her to leave it as soon as possible. You also know that you are “lucky” that you were granted permission to be assessed at home you could just as easily have been forced to travel miles, exhausted, or sent in your wheelchair to a centre with steps and no ramp. You consider how exactly the employee of a private company is in a better place to judge your health needs than your own consultant who has provided evidence, and whether putting foundation on was a mistake in case you look “too well”.Throughout it all, there sits the elephant in the room: that this is all pointless. That by virtue of genetics, it is scientifically impossible that you have been cured since your last assessment. And yet you sit there, going through the motions, because non-disabled cabinet ministers told the rightwing media that people like you shouldn’t be “allowed to fester” on benefits.Pip is, of course, just one part of sweeping disability benefit “reform” in recent years, in which “reform” has become a euphemism for savage cuts. This week research by the Disability Benefits Consortium (DBC), a coalition of more than 80 UK disability organisations, showed changes to the social security system over the past 10 years have left disabled adults four times worse off financially than those without a disability. It has long been understood that disabled people have borne the brunt of austerity, but this is the first time a comprehensive study has laid it bare.The details of the report paint a picture of the government running a cruel game: the more health problems you have, the more you actually lose out – people with six or more disabilities are losing more than £2,100 each year on average, compared with someone with one disability, who loses £700 – while disabled children have been targeted too. Households with one disabled adult and one disabled child have had their support cut most, with average losses of more than £4,300 a year. This is a nation of distorted priorities, in which prospective prime ministers flex tax cuts for the healthy and wealthy, and the already poor and sick are pushed further into hardship.The DBC study details the way in which many disabled and chronically ill people put through “reforms” feel “highly stressed, distrusted, and constantly challenged”. One woman with multiple sclerosis told the researchers that she had had her Pip cut and was about to lose the Motability car she needed to get to work. The anguish brought on a severe MS relapse. She’s now lost all feeling in her left leg.I was “lucky”. Unlike some, I didn’t have to skip meals because my disability benefits had been removed. I wasn’t forced to go through a lengthy and exhausting appeal. I wasn’t, like the late Stephen Smith, forced to discharge myself from hospital in order to attend the tribunal to fight my case. But it is surely a sign of a broken system when disabled people relying on Britain’s safety net are grateful if it catches them without too much pain.In this way, “welfare reform” reinforces the narrative drilled into members of marginalised groups – that while for many the state is a vehicle to support them in times of need, for others it offers little more than abuse and disbelief.The DBC report offers conclusive proof of what disabled people have long known: benefit cuts are unjust, harmful, and widespread.

Fathers and same-sex partners want to be more involved and share parenting more equally – not just in the later stages of childhood, but right from the first second that their child is born.I firmly believe that mums and dads should be given the opportunity to do this and that’s why, back when I was shadow minister for women and equalities, I first set out to develop the shared parental leave policy we have today.This provides much greater choice over who cares for a new child in the first year and the flexibility for families to share the maternity leave period as they see fit. It has steadily begun to challenge and change societal attitudes towards who “should” stay at home and care for a baby.But all too often it is still mothers, not fathers, who shoulder the burden of childcare. So it is clear that we need to do more.The UK has some of the most generous maternity leave allowances in the world, but we only guarantee new dads and same-sex partners a fortnight off work – making it harder for them to bond with their child and care for their partner, and implying that it is the lot of the mother to be the primary caregiver.More often than not it is the mother who cuts her hours or opts to work flexibly the mother who decides not to go for promotion the mother who stays at home when the child is ill. Much of the gender pay gap can be traced back to the balance of childcare responsibilities, while the lack of women in senior positions is partly caused by the fact that mothers, much more than fathers, are too often expected to juggle careers with caring.This is not inevitable. Experience around the world shows that when fathers are primary caregivers in the first year, even for just a short period, they are more likely to be involved in childcare over the longer term.But we’re not sending fathers the correct message when our current leave allowances give women 26 times more leave than men.Evidence shows that for fathers to take more leave it needs to be dedicated leave for them, and it needs to be paid better. That’s why on Friday we will launch a consultation looking at how we can improve the current system – calling for views on whether paternity leave and pay should be increased or whether shared parental leave should be reformed.I believe that increasing paternity entitlements will not only give fathers more time to spend with their newborns, but will also be an important step towards equalising the roles of men and women both at home and in the workplace. It will help ensure from the outset that caring for children is a shared responsibility and means that employers will not be able to make assumptions about who will take on childcare responsibilities when a couple start a family.Our consultation will also address the current failing to provide specific support for parents who are already dealing with the unimaginable stress of their babies needing special neonatal care.When I visited Alder Hay children’s hospital earlier this year, I heard first-hand from parents whose babies had been born prematurely or suffered complications early in their young lives. They had more than enough on their plates without worrying about their jobs, but the fathers in particular were all too aware that their leave was ticking away, and that they would likely have to be back at work long before their partner and precious newborn came home.That’s not fair and it’s not right. So we will also be proposing a new neonatal leave and pay entitlement, for parents whose babies need to spend a prolonged period in neonatal care.Under our plans parents will be given a week of leave and pay for every week their child is in hospital, making our system fairer and more compassionate.These are issues close to my heart and I’m proud that Friday’s consultation – the next evolution of the shared parental leave policy that I started long ago – is one of my final acts as prime minister.• Theresa May is the prime minister of the UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ca43af20277eb9999b252cf238f4176f05874d/341_133_3311_1988/master/3311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e254eeb5601813a02cadec0a31aaa66d","title":"love island fast fashion sustainable new outfit bikini","story":"The ITV show is fast fashion’s biggest advocate, but the planet can’t take any more £1 bikinisLike millions of viewers, I’m hopelessly addicted to Love Island in a way I never thought I would be. But my biggest problem is not so much with the show per se, it’s with fast fashion.\u0027Fast fashion\u0027 is a phrase coined to describe inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. Critics say that the industry has a large carbon footprint,\u0026nbspand creates water and air pollution. Clothes are often manufactured in poor working conditions.Garments are manufactured cheaply, and are expected to have a short life. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers,\u0026nbspconsider garments worn once or twice to be\u0026nbspold. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for\u0026nbspa quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.Through omnipresent product placements and advertising, Love Island has turned into fast fashion’s biggest advocate. Every day, girls in the villa wear a new outfit, promoting the insidious idea that you cannot be seen in the same clothes twice. You can even shop for what the islanders wear in real time through the show’s app or via its partner I Saw It First, encouraging impulsive purchases. When Britons are already expected to buy 50m single-use outfits this summer, the show only adds fuel to the fire, or rather to the truckload of clothes that ends up in the landfill every second.The problem is our planet cannot take more £1 bikinis. When clothes are so cheap, they are usually made out of materials derived from plastic, such as polyester or nylon. These materials can take hundreds of years to decompose in a landfill, and release thousands of microfibres during each wash, which end up in our oceans.To keep costs down, the fast fashion industry has also been known for manufacturing in some of the lowest-wage countries, where labour and safety standards are particularly poor. Despite pledges for better working conditions in supply chains following the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh in 2013, this model remains prevalent today.Love Island has an incredible platform and the potential to influence millions of people. I wish the show used it to be a force for good, starting with fashion. The good news is there are a number of opportunities to get on the sustainable fashion path.Reducing our consumption of virgin fibres by reusing garments is essential to tackle the throwaway culture fast fashion promotes. More and more influencers are embracing the slow fashion movement, turning to what’s already in their wardrobe rather than buying new. If Emma Watson and Livia Firth proudly re-wear outfits on the most coveted red carpets, surely islanders could do the same in the villa.Far from the stigma it was once associated with, thrifting and upcycling are also becoming fashion statements. With the comeback of crafting, doing new with old is no longer seen as an odd thing to do. Wearing clothes that have had a previous life is an opportunity to look fashionable with one-of-a-kind pieces while reducing the need for new resources. Rather than a hundredth kissing challenge, what about harnessing the creative potential of our islanders behind a sewing machine?After taxis and hotels, the sharing economy is on its way to disrupt the fashion industry. New business models have arisen in the past 10 years making it possible to rent, borrow or swap clothes. Their success in the market shows that clothes do not need to be brand new to feel new to consumers. When new is the only option, alternatives to fast fashion do exist. A number of ethical and sustainable fashion brands have emerged, shedding a new light on the importance of better materials and fair working conditions in the supply chain. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has subtly turned into a sustainable fashion champion. It only takes one wear from her to make the sales of brands such as Veja or Reformation skyrocket. Could you imagine what would happen if Love Island did the same?It’s no secret that brand partnerships generate significant revenue for reality TV. But the climate crisis we are facing is very real too, and we know for a fact that fashion plays a key role in it. So now may be a good time for Love Island to embrace its corporate social responsibility, and rethink its partnership strategy in the light of the emergency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb7563f4ce81535c726a2f3fa54ceeb39ed39306/1768_0_2072_1244/master/2072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64d187e240f77ad582e161f95b2f5886","title":"the guardian view on ebola in the drc help needed and dialogue too","story":"Are we able to learn the right lessons when disaster strikes? Five years ago, a devastating outbreak of Ebola in west Africa claimed more than 11,000 lives, and sparked an international panic as it reached the US and Europe. The experience led to the vaccine and experimental treatments now being used in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But this outbreak has become the second most deadly despite efforts to combat it over the last year. More than 1,600 people in the north-east of the country have died. Now, with the virus flaring up again in places where it had been contained, reaching the major city of Goma on the border with Rwanda, and spreading over 500km, with cases identified in Uganda, the World Health Organization has declared it an emergency of international concern.This is a very different challenge from 2014’s. It is not only a public health but a humanitarian crisis, taking place in a conflict zone, with widespread malnutrition, a struggling health system, and deep suspicion hampering efforts to control the disease: this year has seen 174 attacks on health workers fighting the outbreak. The fear and distrust of outsiders has been compounded by Ebola’s high fatality rates. Vaccines cannot protect those who have already contracted the disease, and though people are more likely to survive with proper treatment, many delay because they do not trust those offering help: by the time they are finally seen, it is far harder to help them. Those around them may wrongly conclude that vaccines or health workers are the problem and not the cure. They see more international groups at work, and more deaths.The need for community understanding and engagement – made clear by the 2014 outbreak – is more critical than ever. That means dialogue, not instruction: “We need to listen with the ferocity with which we want to be heard,” says an emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières. With their most basic health needs unmet, a rapidly spreading measles outbreak, and ongoing problems with cholera, people may not see Ebola as a priority, particularly if their other concerns are not even acknowledged. Some experts believe that community leaders and local staff must take the lead in the response, and that supporting home care as an interim, if far from ideal, measure may be necessary.But if solutions must be implemented on the ground, they require proper support. WHO hopes that the designation of an emergency will push governments to respond. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to fight this outbreak only half of the money pledged has been delivered. Jim Yong Kim, when president of the World Bank, said the west African outbreak could have been snuffed out in months with sufficient funding. But help only trickled in when western countries began to worry about the potential danger to their own citizens.The risk is that neighbours may close their borders – crippling the economy, increasing hostility and suspicion, and driving transmission chains further underground as people take unmonitored routes or mask their symptoms at crossings. In 2014, WHO’s advice against travel restrictions was ignored by governments and airlines. As the WHO chief said, the decision to call this an emergency should not be used to stigmatise or penalise the very people who most need help. The humanitarian case for backing the fight against Ebola is simple and undeniable. Mothers, fathers, siblings and children are dying, in communities that have already suffered so much. If that is not enough to compel greater action, perhaps self-interest will help. One lesson from the 2014 outbreak was that real international commitment can bring the disease under control. Another was that without such efforts it poses a far broader risk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f5ee83b384017653b579669445c989124dddd49/0_60_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087088c4b064df01284495903035cbb2","title":"i was insta famous and it was one of the worst things to happen in my 20s","story":"You get trapped in your own triviality, in the mind numbing packaging and distribution of the minutiae of your dayNothing messes you up quite so royally as becoming Insta-famous.It’s just as bad as genuine fame, only without the public fawning or free Fendi sports bras to soften your descent into self obsession, insecurity and casual bitchiness.Of course you don’t realise it. You’re busy preaching love, harmony and laxative tea. Plus you’re distracted by every brick wall or passing dog that you could drag in to your #candid shots of you laughing maniacally while holding a conveniently placed (and delicious!) protein shake.I used to be Insta-famous and it was one of the worst things to happen in my 20s. While I did gain a very photogenic selection of free protein powder, it was probably one of the most gruelling, confusing and miserable times of my life.It happened almost accidentally. A few years ago, I had freshly graduated from university and was busy bumming around my student flat when I got a call asking me to move to New Zealand and present on the flagship daily breakfast TV show. I was 21, it was my first real job, and I didn’t even have an Instagram then let alone any aspirations of pastel filtered fame.So I said yes, moved countries and started an account with a vague idea it’d be good to have “for my brand”. And by virtue of being on national TV every morning, I went from nothing to having over 8,000 combined followers across my “channels”.I became a bonafide influencer, getting sent everything from fancy undies to cell phones, and curating every moment of my peachy life with painstakingly casual captions. It was awful. Primarily because I was awful.Insta-fame has a phenomenal, if unsurprising, capacity to turn you into a dick.We all know that real fame is dangerous. It showers you with attention, making you feel as though you are incredibly important and interesting because all these people are paying attention to you.Instafame does all of this. I became convinced that I was so fascinating. If I was the centre of attention on my phone, that should translate into being the centre of attention in real life. It makes you the worst kind of dick: entitled, self obsessed, and incredibly dull because the only thing you think about is yourself. And it wasn’t helped by being in my 20s and so naturally inclined to think the world revolves around me anyway.But it’s also a particularly vicious type of fame because it’s so insecure. Insta-fame is right at the bottom of the glitter hierarchy, widely acknowledged by the genuinely famous as the most fickle and unearned glory – even more than Love Island. You can see where they’re coming from. Most real world famous people earn fame by doing their job really well. But for influencers, your butt shots are your business. So we’re are constantly aware of the tenuousness of our fame, which makes us even more desperate to hold on to it.It’s also the most numbly exhausting job I’ve ever done. Normally it takes at least five hours to do a professional photo shoot. When you’re an influencer, you need this level of quality but don’t have a team behind you so it becomes incredibly time consuming.You get trapped in your own triviality, in the mind numbing packaging and distribution of the minutiae of your day. It’s real joy killer. Normally you take a photo because you want to capture a great moment, right? But as an influencer you have to manufacture those moments, stripmining the fun out of coffee dates because you’re managing the scene like Annie Leibovitz – if Annie Leibovitz was a basic bitch with a passion for latte art.But the very worst, most dangerous part of instafame in your 20s is that it totally messes up your character development. Not only did it make me self obsessed, but it indulged my very worst qualities.Social media feeds those darkest parts of every personality, encouraging you to rant on Twitter, brag on Facebook, or be vain on Insta. Vanity sells on the ‘Gram. The hotter the pic, the better it does, so the more time you spend in the mirror creating them. Staying Instafamous relies on you mining the depths of your own narcissism.The problem is that your 20s you’re busy working out who you want to be. A big part of that process is managing and squashing down the dark parts of yourself to make more room for your better parts. But Instafame fed my own vanity and insecurity until it became almost impossible to control them and make space for my better self.So I stopped. I’ve still got Instagram, but I’m officially an ex-influencer. I stopped posting as much and lost a lot of followers, and I deleted most of my classic influencer shots in a fit of self disgust.I realised in order to stay Insta-famous I’d have had to nurture the most pathetic parts of my own psyche. And honestly, no amount of free ombre activewear is worth that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ea86c9989077ec1ffcec8501e143d56e06a2ac/0_164_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4caa6eb279d044b4e26e20b9bffd677","title":"iucn red list reveals wildlife destruction from treetop to ocean floor","story":"Latest list shows extinction now threatens a third of all assessed species, from monkeys to rhino raysFrom the tops of trees to the depths of the oceans, humanity’s destruction of wildlife is continuing to drive many species towards extinction, with the latest “red list” showing that a third of all species assessed are under threat.The razing of habitats and hunting for bushmeat has now driven seven primates into decline, while overfishing has pushed two families of extraordinary rays to the brink. Pollution, dams and over-abstraction of freshwater are responsible for serious declines in river wildlife from Mexico to Japan, while illegal logging is ravaging Madagascar’s rosewoods, and disease is decimating the American elm.The red list, produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is the most authoritative assessment of the status of species. The list published on Thursday adds almost 9,000 new species, bringing the total to 105,732, though this is a fraction of the millions of species thought to live on Earth. Not a single species was recorded as having improved in status.“Nature is declining at rates unprecedented in human history,” said Jane Smart, director of the IUCN bioersity conservation group. She said decisive action was needed to halt the decline, with next year’s UN bioersity convention summit in China seen as crucial.The red list highlights the plight of wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes, known as rhino rays because of their elongated snouts. They are now the most imperilled marine fish families in the world, with all but one of the 16 species critically endangered – meaning they are one step from extinction. Intensified and unregulated fishing is to blame, with the rays usually snared as bycatch.Among the seven primate species pushed closer to extinction, six are in west Africa where deforestation and bushmeat hunting is rife. There are now just 2,000 Roloway monkeys left in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, meaning their population is precariously small. Their relatively large body size and the value of their meat and skin have made them a preferred target for hunters.Humanity’s thirst for fresh water, particularly for farming, is having an especially big impact on river and lake wildlife. The red list update reveals that more than half of the freshwater fish in Japan and over a third in Mexico are now threatened with extinction. Recent research found two-thirds of the world’s great rivers no longer flow freely.“The loss of these freshwater fish species would deprive billions of people of a critical source of food and income, and could have knock-on effects on entire ecosystems,” said William Darwall, head of the IUCN freshwater bioersity unit.The red list update also added 500 deep-sea bony fish species, such as bioluminescent lanternfishes, which face potential threats from deep-fishing, oil and gas drilling and seabed mining. The scaly-foot snail is the first mollusc that lives on deep-sea hydrothermal vents to be added to the list and is assessed as endangered.“Invasive diseases, together with air pollution and climate change, have decimated populations of numerous North American tree species that once provided abundant food for native wildlife, as well scenic beauty,” said Healy Hamilton, at NatureServe, a network of bioersity scientists.Fungi are a growing feature of the list, with the update revealing that at least 15 species that grow in the traditional countryside of many European countries are now threatened with extinction. The bright red splendid waxcap, found in the UK and Germany, is one which has suffered as semi-natural grasslands have been converted to intensive agriculture.“Loss of species and climate change are the two great challenges facing humanity this century,” said Lee Hannah at Conservation International. The red list addresses both, he said, by including the threat of global heating in the assessment of extinction risk. “The results are clear, we must act now on both.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d011b9ba4b7dcd235cf95b4a48e98fb1272157de/0_88_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c23d29cf5ead749878286378b79b80","title":"the impact is tremendous readers on wildflower verges","story":"Readers share how wildflowers are bringing colour and life to previously sterile green spacesCatastrophic news for insect life has inspired communities and councils around the UK to take action, generating splashes of summer colour which hope to have a lasting impact.After reporting a campaign by the conservation charity Plantlife to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges, we asked you to share stories from where you are.Below, readers share some of their local successes, including thoughts about how leaving nature to run its course by standing back rather than taking action can help – and explain how they have been getting involved in community projects big and small.“Hengrove Way is a 1960s dual carriageway in the south of Bristol. The wide central verge was originally reserved for a tram system but was planted a few years ago with an avenue of purple beech trees. The meadow here is sown annually by the Bristol city council parks. Budgets are tight and so they try and make a little spread a long way – in this case there are over 300 metres of flowers: as a resident they give me much enjoyment.” Richard, Bristol“Three neighbouring families with five children grouped together to care for three unloved grass verges adjacent to our homes in Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire. We planted yellow rattle to compete with the grass annuals to provide colour in year one, and perennials from year two onwards. We lovingly named our patch Flack Wild Heath.“I was mowing the verges myself each week anyway, and over a beer with our neighbours, we decided we should give it a go. We’ve had lots of interest and look forward to new friends in the village extending the Heath from next year. More of us should do the same it’s easy to sit back and wait for the council or someone else. Actually though, there’s way more pleasure in seeing our own patch develop. Very rewarding. In fact, it’s ace arriving home each day to see what’s popped up.” Marcus Firmin, Buckinghamshire“I planted this wildflower bank earlier this year on the edge of a path which overlooks a meadow outside my home. The idea is to develop areas that give colour to the meadow as well as attracting different types of wildlife, while trying just to manage small areas and keeping things as natural as possible.” David Warr, Jersey“It seems that council cuts have resulted in random scalping of verges and open spaces, with what appears to be no real plan, but they seem happy when community groups such as ours, with some skill, take on their sites. We’re sure we can save them money, improve the environment, spread beauty and pollen – there are so many advantages there seems no reason not to!” Diana Cusack, Totnes“Taken this week whilst on my way into the town centre. One of many small urban spaces that have been planted by the local council.” James, Newport“As a gardener, I know the work involved in preparing and maintaining verges. As long as vehicle sight lines are maintained where necessary, I feel this verge on the Kegworth bypass is a superb example of how the natural environment is so much more attractive than the sterile, known alternative. I am a gardener at a nearby university where the campus has initiated a bioersity scheme to encourage wildlife within its grounds. A number of areas are being left unmown poorer ground is being seeded with suitable wildflower mixes. The study will try to identify any change in the number of plants animals and insects within campus.” Dave Bicker, Loughborough“This verge on both sides of a wide dual carriageway and on the central reservation was planted by nature. Each year, Surrey county council mows it all flat when the flowers are in bloom, citing safety, although the extent is clearly excessive by common sense standards. This deprives stressed motorists of an uplifting and soothing experience on their journey, as well as disrupting or terminating the lives of countless amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates. Planting verges is good: but don’t forget nature did it first, and all we have to do is respect and wonder.” Jenny Desoutter, Dorking“These are not planted – they’re wild native plants! I monitor two of our local verges for the Yorkshire Dales national park’s Orton Special Verges project: we don’t plant verges and do not think we need to do it.“We need to educate people about what we already have as our native flora. It’s better to conserve the flora that will naturally grow in meadows and verges, for example by not mowing too soon (apart from a safety strip if needed for visibility). Late mowing, to let grassland plants set seed, and taking off the mowings to keep fertility low will allow native plants to regenerate as well as being cheaper for the councils than year round mowing or trying to seed verges with plants that want arable conditions.” Sue Millard, Cumbria“Burleys, Lewes district council and Wildflower Lewes have been planting up verges across Lewes District for three years. There are several different types of meadows, those that are more bioersity rich – which are perennial wildflowers – are sown once and then left to get on with it, year on year. The other meadows are the annual wildflower seeds chosen for our pollinators – these are much prettier and have to be sown yearly. These mini-meadows are scattered across roadside verges, recreation fields, housing estates and cemeteries. This year all the meadows were teeming with butterflies, bees, grasshopper and crickets. It’s amazing just how many insects benefit from such small areas.“We want to improve the bioersity of our district, educate and inspire others to do the same and hopefully they will get closer to nature by visiting more green spaces. We plant chalk-loving plug plants in some areas to create mini-downland areas in the hope that residents will get out more, reducing social isolation and improving health and wellbeing. We receive many compliments about how the wildflower verges have make them happy on their way to work and school – the wider impact a small patch of ground can have on people is tremendous and shouldn’t be underestimated.” Karen Rigby-Faux, Lewes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d26aa46f59114f854d69959bf8d93f8a88e5d8/0_0_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4d579cee5c25955c14f3e530e76877c","title":"raising the steaks how to have a fancy barbecue","story":"Tired of guests taking you for granted while you slave over a hot grill? Try your hand at marinated goat, deconstructed ratatouille or boozy poultryThere is a lot to be said for barbecues, including smell, taste, poignant memories of summers past, licensed overeating and the ubiquity of coleslaw, but I have noticed one thing: the chef never gets any credit. It is a bit of reverse sexism: men usually take over, in what we can call “manflipping” or “pyromannia”, so if you praise the chef, you are shoring up the patriarchy, even if a woman did all the marinating or, for once, the chef is actually a woman. It is mainly the sense that he or she does jack-all, beyond opening some packets. Which is fundamentally unfair, since knowing what is what on an open flame that you use twice a year is far more technically demanding than using an oven. Maybe you don’t care about credit. But if you do, here are a few suggestions.Try interesting cuts of meat. Classic barbecue fare tends towards the banal (chicken breasts) or at best workaday (the sausage). What you want is meat round a complicated bone, to give it some structure and slow-release flavour against the suddenness of the heat, and what you get is a load of steaks that have very few defences. I would never barbecue steaks again, having discovered that you can cook them in an air fryer, which locks in flavour without leeching out moisture. The best barbie cut, meanwhile, flash-fried, perfect unadorned, is the Barnsley chop. The nubbly central bone that gives it that butterfly shape makes it unusually juicy, while the fat turns to lamb crackling, which you almost never see in domestic life.Better still, try an unusual meat. In an unassuming yet peerless book, My Bombay Kitchen, Niloufer Ichaporia King has a recipe for shoulder of kid, in which you poach it first, marinate it for two hours in a marsala mix that includes chilli, cumin, hoisin, ginger and garlic, then stick it on coals for a quarter of an hour until it has a reddish crust that could charm a hyena out of a rage. You can use the poaching liquor for some rice on the side, and if anybody doesn’t congratulate you on this, it will be because they’re vegetarian and they hate you for it.Arguably, a sweet-fleshed piece of fish is even more of a showstopper, since it has a curious alchemy with the charcoal that underlines rather than obliterates its delicacy. It is fragile, though: unless it’s mackerel, big clumps can go through the bars, and the better it tastes, the more you resent the waste. Plus it is expensive: at the weekend I was so resistant to barbecuing a turbot – it was 24 quid it would have been like feeding pound coins into a grabber at the arcade – that Mr Z made it a cage out of coat hangers. You can only do one side this way you have to put a lid on the barbecue and let the other side cook by convection. Also, do not make the mistake of thinking the handles won’t be red hot, even when they are not red. Otherwise, it is a brilliant fish fix, and also works for a skate wing.Or else, cook regular meat in an unusual fashion. Get a can of cider, open it, put it on the grill. Get a chicken – you’ll need to poach it for 20 minutes beforehand if you don’t like to live life on the wild side – and wedge it, by its butt cavity, over the can. This works best on a barbecue that is already cooling a little, because the chicken will be here a while. Put the lid down cook for 40 minutes. Basically what happens is that the can heats up insanely and cooks the bird from the inside, while the outside cooks on the grill. The cider evaporates into the meat and keeps it moist (you can try it with lager, too), and the whole thing looks quite tickling, like a tiny gangster being taught a lesson.Mr Z does a few things for vegetarians, including chalcots, a cross between a spring onion and a leek, which you char, then wrap in newspaper. The scorched outer skin slips effortlessly off, leaving them beautifully silky inside. And deconstructed ratatouille: grill aubergine, courgette, tomato and garlic chop or mash them as they come off, then season very liberally in the bowl, as if you are making the French classic backwards, and much faster. If I’m honest, if someone asked what you were eating, you wouldn’t immediately say “ratatouille”. But you would say: “This is an innovative and delightful gesture towards the typically uncatered-to vegetarian in these circumstances.”If you think people praising you doesn’t actually matter alfresco then, of course, don’t bother with any of this and go ahead with your burgers. But I sometimes think the reason everyone eats so much off a grill is that you don’t savour things unless you can taste the effort. What I want from food is the taking of infinite pains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f90d2dbfbbb924e790f9ba461c8f37b925417cbc/51_313_5237_3142/master/5237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78c14999a2f19b944e50ab63003a309a","title":"sportpesa gambling company premier league kenya","story":"Barely heard of in Britain until it launched a spree of Premier League club sponsorships in 2016, the online gambling platform SportPesa has since spread its name across football, rugby, horseracing and Formula One, associating its branding with good works in Africa. At Everton, where SportPesa is the main sponsor, its name is prominent all over Goodison Park, the club have been in Kenya for a pre-season tour, and they promote SportPesa’s “Kits for Africa” initiative, with a donation bin in the club store.Everton’s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, wrote in the club’s annual report: “We value our developing relationship with SportPesa, who have demonstrated a strong alignment with our values.” A spokesperson for Everton, who describe themselves as “the people’s club”, said Barrett-Baxendale was referring to the sponsor’s support for the club’s extensive community work, which she herself pioneered in the deprived areas around Goodison Park.Founded in Nairobi as a partnership of wealthy, politically influential Kenyans with Bulgarian investors, SportPesa mined its huge fortune exploiting an online gambling craze in the east African country. Kenya’s interior minister, Fred Matiang’i, warned recently of rising addiction and suicides, adding that gambling will “destroy the moral fabric” without strengthened regulation.In the UK, while SportPesa has promoted its brand through the Everton sponsorship and partnerships with Arsenal, Southampton and Hull City, it makes use of the “white label” system, allied to a company, TGP Europe, registered offshore in the Isle of Man, a tax haven. This structure, permitted by the UK government, means SportPesa does not require a licence from the Gambling Commission, UK bets are paid to the Isle of Man, and no SportPesa company appears to pay UK corporation tax on those revenues, nor contribute to UK gambling welfare programmes.Campaign groups including Gambling with Lives have criticised the English football establishment for selling its appeal so enormously to gambling, with many Premier League and Football League clubs – and the EFL isions themselves – sponsored by betting companies, and concerns are escalating about problem gambling and the game’s “gamblification”.SportPesa grew rapidly in Kenya to dominate online gambling by zealously exploiting the mass arrival of mobile phone technology from 2014, and sponsors the country’s Premier League. With little regulation and no welfare or research similar to even the UK’s limited industry-funded framework, serious problem gambling appears to have become entrenched among Kenyan young people, who are gambling and losing far more than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.Matiang’i, finally proposing new regulation in May, said $2bn was gambled annually in Kenya, mostly by low earners, and that 500,000 young people defaulted on loans to fund gambling. Last week SportPesa was among a number of gambling companies in Kenya whose licences were suspended because of reported concerns about non-compliance with regulations, although SportPesa said it did comply and is continuing to operate because of a court order.Ivaylo Bozoukov, SportPesa’s director of global strategy, told the  that SportPesa’s expansion into the UK, which includes offices in Liverpool’s Liver building where Everton are also based, was funded by the profits made in Africa. Well-placed sources have told the investigative website Finance Uncovered that SportPesa made more than $1bn revenues last year in Kenya, but the company does not make its revenues or profits, in Africa or the UK, public. A spokesperson described that figure as “a very significant overstatement” and said: “As is common with private companies, we have made a commercial decision not to publish our revenues in order to protect our competitiveness.”SportPesa does have a UK-registered company, SportPesa Global Holdings, formed in March 2017, which does declare its shareholders and accounts, but the brand’s structure means that its UK gambling revenues do not appear to be received by that company.The holding company’s largest Bulgarian shareholder, Guerassim Nikolov, a casino owner, moved to Nairobi in 1999 from Sofia, where he operated a casino, and he founded SportPesa in 2014. Described as the group chief executive, Nikolov wholly denies claims made in Bulgarian media in 2006 that he left the country after being questioned by police in relation to an alleged criminal incident.Asked by the  about these claims, a SportPesa spokesperson said: “Mr Nikolov vehemently denies the allegations contained within the stories you have highlighted to us and we strongly urge you to treat any claims – most of which are made in personal blogs and by anonymous sources – with extreme scepticism.Nikolov and other Bulgarian investors are said to have provided the gambling and digital technology expertise in the partnership that founded SportPesa. The largest Kenyan shareholder is Asenath Wacera, whose late husband, Dickson Wathika, was the mayor of Nairobi and a long-term friend of the country’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta. Paul Wanderi Ndung’u, another major shareholder, is a prominent entrepreneur in Kenya, having invested early in mobile telecommunications, and he is a major financier and fundraiser for Kenyatta’s Jubilee party.Kenyatta’s spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry from the  about whether the lobbying from SportPesa or the gambling industry had an impact on his change of stance. SportPesa responded by saying: “Our growth is attributable to outstanding customer experience and we refute any suggestion that the company has sought advantage through political connections.”“SportPesa is powered by TGP Europe Ltd of … Douglas, Isle of Man,” it notes. “TGP Europe Ltd is licensed and regulated by the Gambling Commission of Great Britain for provision of services to the United Kingdom.”The SportPesa spokesperson said of this minimal contribution: “We share your concerns about this and raised the issue with TGP directly. As a result, they have now agreed to increase their annual contribution to GambleAware to £10,000.”SportPesa’s spokesperson said TGP is responsible for betting duty payable to HMRC on UK bets, but did not respond to a question about whether SportPesa pays UK corporation tax on its profits.Isle of Man-registered companies do not pay UK tax or publish financial accounts, so there is no available record of how much money TGP or SportPesa are making from their expanding UK gambling operations. The owners of TGP Holdings are listed as three Isle of Man trusts and one trust based in the British Virgin Islands, another tax haven. There is no public information about who the beneficiaries are of these trusts.TGP Europe did not respond at all to questions about the structure of its operation, the revenues from SportPesa and whether any UK corporation tax is paid.In its statement, SportPesa did not respond to questions about the company’s UK revenues or whether UK tax is paid on them. Its spokesperson said: “We are a socially responsible business that puts tremendous emphasis on grassroots sport and community development. We are fully compliant with all UK and international legal requirements and, as a company that operates in highly regulated markets, we take our responsibilities extremely seriously.”In response to the wider question of how renowned English football clubs decide to partner their names so wholeheartedly with gambling companies, particularly where brands are linked offshore and their finances are not publicly transparent, none of the clubs would explain their decision-making process. Hull City declined to comment, as did Southampton, whose three-year partnership with SportPesa ended last season.An Everton spokesperson said in a statement: “As with all our partnership agreements, a due diligence process was carried out both by the club and external advisers. Through this, we obtained the assurances we needed in order to proceed with a partnership with SportPesa.”A spokesperson for Arsenal, whose partnership with SportPesa finished in May, said: “We do not discuss the details of any of our commercial partnerships, but would point out that we conduct due diligence checks via third-party organisations where appropriate before entering into agreements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f3ff73086336535c6e036d8780decd843614aef/0_104_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cc60e031e387a32b228d3ec75ca6309","title":"we just clicked why i set out to find a new group of friends online","story":"Can a friendship app, a digital neighbourhood noticeboard or Facebook really help me discover a new bestie?This year started with a bang. It burst into life with fireworks and kisses, and then came the sound of a spoon tapping on a wine glass. “Since we’re all together,” said my friend, “I wanted to say it’s been an honour knowing you while I’ve been in London.”Another leaving speech. I have heard many over the past few years, watching loved ones leave in search of job opportunities or housing security, or as a cure for homesickness. Later, as I lay in bed, I thought about my rate of friend attrition. How long until I found myself totally alone? Five years? Ten? My new year resolution was a no-brainer: I must try to make new friends.To help me on my journey, I contact Kate Leaver, author of The Friendship Cure, a book exploring modern friendship. She was inspired to write it by an article in the Atlantic, in which journalist Julie Beck argued that we shed friendships as we age because our spouses (to whom we are legally bound) and our family (to whom we are biologically bound) fill our worlds. When that happens, friendships are the first to go. “That article essentially frightened me into a year-long research binge so I could make the case for reviving our interest and our investment in friendship,” says Leaver.She says we have “organised our modern lives so that we’re more isolated than we think we are”. Social media makes us believe we are surrounded by people, and we may mistake likes and comments for intimacy. Offline, meanwhile, we have been brought up to believe it is unacceptable to speak to strangers, even as traditional public spaces – libraries, sports centres – are being closed down. In the few spaces that remain, she says: “We’re left with all these grown adults not knowing how to make new friends or get close to people.”This rings painfully true. I go to the gym two or three times a week, yet my visits are silent. I don’t enjoy the gym I do it so I don’t drop dead in 30 years. I pass through, barely making eye contact, let alone exchanging words. Can the internet help me make friends there? I decide to follow my gym on Instagram, commenting on its posts alongside other members. Mostly, these are health fanatics and their comments are just fire emojis (a symbol that means exciting or excellent) – so I’m not sure how I could build intimacy. I try to get involved anyway, heaping praise and asking questions. Later, at the gym, I approach another user, a man who looks as if he is in his late 20s, and ask if he was the person I saw on Instagram winning a fitness challenge. He was. We swap names and talk about where we live. If we have lots in common, it is not immediately apparent. Perhaps it is our millennial inability to carry on a conversation, or perhaps we are both tired after exercise, but the chat dwindles. We don’t speak when our paths cross again, but I do get a wave now and then.I also download a friend-making app – Bumble BFF. I am already using Bumble for dating and it is easy enough to toggle between the friends and romance platforms. I even use the same bio: “lefty journalist from London, climbing the ladder of success wrong by wrong”. I think it is charming, but other women do not. My rate of matches in the friend setting is significantly lower than in the romance section. I initiate a conversation with every match I receive, but notice that potential friendships are not tended with the same energy as possible romances. Perhaps Beck is right – in the choice between love and friendship, pals always lose.The swipe functionality of Bumble BFF also makes me uncomfortable. Like the romance portion, you swipe right to say you like the profile, left to say you don’t. And you can make this decision based on one picture, rather than needing to take in the whole profile before you give your verdict. You cannot move on to another profile until you have cast your judgment, so you are primed to decide within seconds in order to sate your curiousity about who is next. Inevitably, I find myself judging other women based on their looks – on what I think their clothes communicate about their personality, or what the set up of their shots says about their interests – and no doubt I am being judged similarly. It hurts to be reduced to this, and more so than it does when it is by the opposite sex.Using an app for friendship rather than romance also drives home how chatting online with strangers is not a patch on talking face to face, when communication comes through many mediums – tone, body language, expression – all processed in an instant. Even a few words tell you so much. Perhaps we put up with it in our love lives because the “prize” of romance is put on such a high pedestal. Using the same tools to search for a friend reveals how truly blunt they are. I struggle to create any intimacy, or puncture the polite veneer of the chat box (“How are you today?” “I am fine. How are you?”). It makes sense: I am ultimately a stranger, no matter how many laughs we share, or how much we agree on Brexit. We all keep our guard up for strangers. They could be anyone, and so could I. Each conversation is taking a punt. And we may be more likely to do it for love than friendship.In the end, I manage to have proper conversations with a couple of women. They seem very nice, but live a bit too far away to meet. I lose momentum and feel frustrated with the app. I say my goodbyes and delete it.However, there is another number that Dunbar says is important to friendships: 30. One of the biggest barriers to meaningful friendships is distance, with 30 minutes being the longest time we would spend travelling to meet up. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s on foot, by bicycle or car, 30 minutes’ travel time is the tipping point. It is not our observation, but something that sociologists have commented on.”With this in mind, I prioritise making friends near home. I download a community app, Nextdoor, which is regularly listed as one of the best apps through which to make friends. It effectively acts as a digital noticeboard for your local area, including adverts for evening classes and book clubs, which both seem like prime buddy-making opportunities. But nobody is idly chatting on Nextdoor. It is not obvious how you can build online relationships when replying to posts about parking permits or moths giving people a rash. However, on another community website, the hyper-local Harringay Online, I notice a post from my neighbour – to whom I have never spoken, despite living next to her for several years. When I see her in the local pub, I strike up a conversation about her post. Success! We get on. We have a drink and become Facebook friends.It may seem daft to view nurturing an acquaintanceship with someone who lives next to you as an accomplishment. But it has forced me to challenge my own strict belief that people – above anything else, even above my desire to chat – have a right to be left alone. It simply feels rude to “bother” people I need a suitable reason. Even using an app such as Bumble BFF, which is designed to introduce people, does not help. After all, just because someone uses the same app as me does not mean they want to speak to me.However, research suggests we have a warped impression of other people’s reluctance to talk to us. The average person consistently underestimates how much a stranger has enjoyed speaking to them. This has been termed “the liking gap”, although, it is worth noting that it applies to real-life interactions, not digital ones.Still, I wonder if my existing social media connections may be the most fruitful source of friends. They have already expressed an interest in me as an inidual, and I should have some sense of them as people and be confident that we have something in common. Indeed, I met one of my closest friends on my favourite platform, Twitter.I return to the chasm of hyperbole and scroll through the lists of people I follow and who follow me, looking out for those I regularly engage with. I send direct messages to a few. Every single person replies. Shared interests spring up easily and conversation comes naturally, as does an offer to catch up in person.I also take to Facebook searching for something similar, but as I barely use the platform, it instead acts as a time capsule for a past version of me. I joined Facebook in 2006 and used it actively (pointless statuses, pokes, and all), but from 2011 my interaction with it slowed. Now I check in periodically, but barely engage. With a large proportion of Facebook friends being people I met more than 10 years ago, I am not sure I still have anything in common with many of them. But perhaps Facebook’s supposed aim – to keep us connected with people we might otherwise lose contact with – will come in handy. Jeffrey Hall, a researcher from the University of Kansas, found that you need 80-100 hours to become friends with someone, or 200 hours to become close friends. But what if you have already racked up those hours? This is why one of the easiest ways to make friends is to reconnect with old ones. And there are plenty of old friends on Facebook.I contact Paul, my BFF from sixth-form college. He went to a different university and, although we tried to stay in touch, our paths erged over time. We chat briefly online, opting to meet for dinner right away. The dinner is like old times and there is no distance between us even though so much has changed. We discuss our respective new partners and what happened to the old ones, our new jobs and where we hope to go, as well as our old hobbies, which remain the same (writing and film-watching). The shared sense of humour and curiosity about the world makes for a joyful meal. We arrange to meet again, and remain in touch.In some ways, it is comforting to assume we lose touch with people because we grow apart. The alternative is that our own idleness or inattention slowly separates us from those we once connected with. Perhaps friendships are more elusive than we think, and so delicate they will die unless actively nurtured. The internet is not a silver bullet for loneliness – indeed, it may distort our natural behaviour and our understanding of what friendship is. But it can at least signpost where meaningful meetings may happen, and it can keep you in the loop of existing relationships.Leaver tells me about the twentysomethings she interviewed for her book. “One of them said she felt like the TV show Friends had lied to her because she grew up expecting to get this neat group of friends. I think loneliness in young people is partly explained by the gap between their expectations and the reality.”As for me, my search for new friends brings me back to old friends, to friendly faces I see each day and those I already know, but have not given enough attention to. I count up all the messages I regularly forget to reply to, and the old work colleagues I adored, but lost touch with. And I send an overdue text using three, magic words: “Fancy a catchup?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50407bad9513c7f2c1a0846ab2858617f08592da/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d40cb837ff856a35f1e397d16b3aa965","title":"let down by natwest new cheque scanning system","story":"Reader who runs small business is out of pocket because of NatWest’s software updateI run a small manufacturing business in Devon.

We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45c4c0421651847b2fb3c89c779c96825af739a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9104a8fbe287510bd6c4115b3bfdbaa","title":"the evolution of the new balance 99x series in pictures","story":"The New Balance 990v5 – which was released in the UK in May this year – is the latest trainer in a 37-year footwear dynasty.

The Apollo 11 lunar module was on its historic descent to the moon’s crater-pocked surface on 20 July 1969 when a fuel light blinked on. Still 100ft (30 metres) above the ground, it was not what the astronauts needed. The Eagle’s tank was nearly dry.In a new video interview about the momentous first landing on the moon, Buzz Aldrin, the mission’s lunar module pilot, describes how he held his tongue when the warning light appeared and Charlie Duke, Nasa’s capsule communicator, came on the line from Houston to inform Aldrin and Neil Armstrong they had only 60 seconds left to make it down.“OK. One hundred feet. Sixty seconds. We’d better ease down,” Aldrin recalls thinking. But he thought better of telling Armstrong to get a move on. Dressed in a jacket and “Destination Mars” T-shirt, his fingers adazzle with rings, Aldrin’s contorted face conveys how dicey the moment was. “But I don’t want to disturb Neil by saying: ‘Hurry up, hurry up!’” he says, leaning in and dropping his voice.Armstrong had enough on his mind. From an altitude of about 500 ft he had taken control of the lunar module and was carefully steering the craft down. Nobody knew how the module would handle and there in front of the descending craft loomed a large crater that would have spelled disaster for the men and the mission.The astronauts had already had to contend with program alarms going off in the module, which themselves could have forced the mission to abort. The glitch was eventually resolved, leading to a “go” from Houston, but as Aldrin concedes: “it tended to distract a little bit.”The Eagle dropped 90 ft over the next 30 seconds, leaving the crew a further half minute of fuel to navigate the final 10 ft to the lunar surface. In the interview recorded at the Science Museum in London in 2016, but released on Thursday for the first time, Aldrin says it was only at that late stage that he felt more confident about the landing. “I figured, ah, we got it made,” he recalls.It was a feat that succeeded by the finest of margins. “We touched down, and I think the estimate, not because somebody put a dipstick in the fuel to see how much was left, but it was calculations and information onboard, we probably had about 15 seconds of fuel left.”The museum is marking the 50th anniversary of the Apollo missions with a Summer of Space, featuring the Soyuz capsule from Tim Peake’s mission to the International Space Station and the original Apollo 10 command module simulator console. The latter will go on display alongside the Apollo 10 command module, “Charlie Brown”. The mission served as a dress rehearsal for the moon landing and the module holds the record for the fastest crewed vehicle in history, having reached a speed of 24,790 miles per hour as it fell back to Earth on 26 May 1969. Aldrin’s interview will appear on the Science Museum’s YouTube channel.For those of a certain age, the museum will celebrate the touchdown of Apollo 11 on Saturday with a special screening of The Clangers introduced by Sir Michael Palin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a53b55266c001545bbb0be813dc07dfcbba5506/0_0_2982_3679/master/2982.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d7a6e6c1926a4370026271af607c885 700w","title":"cricket world cup 10 fans countries review action","story":"Readers from around the world reflect on seven weeks of cricket and one astounding finalEngland’s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games.What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I’ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup?Let’s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? Matt LeechWe delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It’s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up.Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm EddingtonIndia were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup – the notorious Kiwis.MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn’t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India’s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future. Abhijato SensarmaDespite the horrible thrashing in the semi-final, we performed above expectations. Six months ago I didn’t think we’d make it to the last four in some respects we got through because other sides failed to deliver.Mitchell Starc was our best performer. It was a shame he went AWOL in the last two matches. Alex Carey looked a class above most in his ball-striking and attitude. He was a real find. To play a great knock after being cleaned up by Jofra Archer really showed he has what it takes. The performances of Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were really disappointing. The one innings where Maxwell looked really like to kick into gear was the one where Usman Khawaja ran him out horribly.The semi-final revealed all our weaknesses at once, which was a shame. Unfortunately our domestic one-day competition is now contained in a short period at the start of our season. It’s not enough for players to improve their skills in this format on the biggest international stage. Scott MeehanPakistan did well. Our performance would be viewed much more positively had we reached the semi-finals, but that’s how fine the margins are. The game against West Indies was very costly and some fans think the Sri Lanka washout was a missed opportunity. Although we have no one to blame but ourselves for not reaching the last four.After beating both the finalists in the group stage, it’s a shame we weren’t consistent enough elsewhere. We have a few special players coming through and they will surely help. Although fielding remains a problem. Awais AhmedWe were hot favourites to finish in the bottom two, yet finished sixth and may have qualified for the semis had we won our two washed-out matches. We have a bright talent in Avishka Fernando. In fact, we could have a fearsome batting unit in 2023. The bowling will be the real concern. We have to search hard for the next Malingas and Muralis. Malinga still has a role to play in four years’ time. We need his personality and experience in the team. And our former cricketers need to take part in building cricket from scratch. The current administration is useless. Akesh SamudithaIt took us four games to get a point on the board and we had to thank the English summer weather for that. South Africa paid the price for a terribly slow start, and highlights were few and far between. The AB De Villiers debate before the tournament obviously didn’t help.I’m hugely disappointed that we were so poor early on. The late wins against Sri Lanka and and Australia, were spoiled by the fact that there was so very little to play for. Wasting a successful 300+ run chase against Australia in a dead rubber hurts. Nils LouwAfter a great start to the tournament – beating South Africa and almost forcing a win against the Kiwis – the Tigers threatened to be the story of the World Cup, but it never quite happened. Instead the campaign ended in a whimper with damaging losses against both south Asian neighbours. The defeat to Pakistan was particularly disappointing given the historical context and the fact they were playing in front of a packed house at Lord’s. It was easily their worst performance of the tournament.In contrast, the stunning run chase against the Windies on the postage stamp-sized Taunton ground was the tournament highlight, reaching the target of 322 with such ease and with so many overs to spare. It gave fans genuine hope for a top-four finish. Had fine margins gone their way, a semi-final place would have been a reality.The team didn’t quite live up to its billing for the emotional Tiger fans. A feeling of the wheels coming off was compounded by the swift dismissal of coach Steve Rhodes long before England lifted the trophy.Giving player of the tournament to Kane Williamson was obviously a sympathy vote. Shakib Al Hasan was the true star of the World Cup. After spending a decade being the most underrated international cricketer in the most underrated international team, Shakib finally became a household name – for those households with Sky TV anyway. His consistency batting at No 3, often arriving at the crease early in the innings, and scoring at nearly a run a ball was staggering. Add to that tidy reliable off-spin and you have the complete package. Tawhid QureshiWe were terrible for most of it. Bowling Pakistan out for 105 in the first game got our hopes up, but there wasn’t enough thought into anything after that and we played out the tournament as a Chris Gayle testimonial tour. At least we beat a plucky Afghanistan side.The authorities must begin planning for the next World Cup immediately by investing in players who will be available solely for the longer version of the game. We have become champions of the T20 game, but the same players struggle in longer formats. T20 is hurting the quality of players in the longer versions. The problem remains that we have a very small pool of players. Glen DucreayIt was always going to be tough. Always. I’m disappointed we didn’t take any points but there were some competitive performances. Falling 11 runs short of beating India, and two balls from shocking Pakistan, were the best memories.Captain Mohammad Nabi had plenty to say before the tournament, but his inexperience showed in the field. I’ll be happy if we can progress tactically and learn from the experience of playing against the very best.

England have to win this Test if they are to stand any chance of regaining the Ashes but already, after 100 overs of attritional cricket and with rain likely to interrupt play across the second and third days, a draw looks the most likely result.England were yet again undone by a patient effort from Ellyse Perry, who finished unbeaten on 84 after a century partnership with Rachael Haynes for the fourth wicket, in an innings that has already sparked comparisons to her 213 not out on the last occasion of this kind, at North Sydney in 2017. Earlier in the day, Alyssa Healy and Meg Lanning had both hit maiden Test half-centuries.It would be hard to argue that England’s bowlers did not throw everything bar the kitchen sink at their opponents, in pursuit of the early match advantage. Katherine Brunt, returning to international duty having missed the third ODI with a swollen ankle, reached 75mph in an opening spell reminiscent of her golden years Sophie Ecclestone bravely bowled on through considerable pain after bruising her shoulder early in the morning session ing for a catch while Test debutant 21-year-old Kirstie Gordon, playing in her first competitive multi-day match, shouldered a load of 20 overs. In fact, all made breakthroughs but none of the three could quite make the decisive impact which the series situation demanded.“One hundred overs in the field is something we’re not used to, and we’ve stuck at it really well,” the England vice-captain, Anya Shrubsole, said. “It was attritional Test cricket, that’s for sure. We hung in there really well, and never let the run rate get away from us, but they batted with a lot of discipline and made it hard.”Australia – whose captain Lanning had insisted on the eve of the Test were on the hunt for a win but for whom a draw will suffice to retain the Ashes trophy – were clearly in no hurry. An aggressive declaration late in the evening session might have been on the cards had Perry and Haynes forced the pace: instead, resuming after tea on 203 for three, they plodded along merrily, content to add only 62 runs across the evening session.Indeed Haynes, who brought up a 145-ball half-century just before stumps, had earlier remained with her tally on 41 so long that the 2,000-strong Taunton crowd might well have suspected the electronic scoreboard had malfunctioned.First blood in the biennial Test had gone to Australia, who after winning the toss opted to bat, setting up a difficult day in the field for the hosts. Brunt provided a chink of light first up, getting enough movement off the seam to bamboozle a tentative Nicole Bolton early with a good-length ball that hit the top of her off stump, leaving Australia 25 for one. But disaster soon struck: Ecclestone, already into the attack as first change on a pitch that looks a spinner’s paradise, ed awkwardly at midwicket and had to leave the field two balls into her next over for treatment.Her fellow left-armer Gordon bravely stepped into the breach, with a first over in Test cricket that will for ever be a four-ball statistical quirk, but the momentum seemed from that moment to pass back to Australia – Healy picked off some wide balls from Shrubsole to ease herself to a 61-ball half-century. Gordon won the battle in the end, having Healy bowled round her legs to claim her maiden Test scalp just before the lunch break she should have added Lanning to her collection shortly afterwards, Heather Knight putting down an easy catch at short cover with the Australian captain on 26.Fortunately Ecclestone was able to return to the fray immediately after the break, in a tight spell that heralded the most sustained period of pressure for Australia and did, ultimately, yield the wicket of Lanning, bowled by a beauty that skidded into the top of her off stump.Shrubsole was fulsome in her praise of the 20-year-old: “She’s probably been our best bowler. She bowled a long spell and caused a lot of problems, particularly in that middle session. She’s a tough northern girl, and did an amazing job for us today.”Perry, though, grabbed back the initiative in the evening session. Shrubsole’s post-match assessment of the match as “evenly poised” seems, in the context of the series, an overly optimistic one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6eae6e285046afc4c67a24c22116ebf8769443b/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a3530ea1648ece9c41fb1eaaad8a85a","title":"england south africa netball world cup match report","story":"England put on their most attractive display of this World Cup as their captain, Serena Guthrie, marshalled a brilliant first-half performance in their 58-47 victory against South Africa. It gave them an 11-goal half-time lead that carried them to a comfortable win, and the Proteas were not helped by the fact that the only person who might have been able to hold Guthrie – their own captain, Bongiwe Msomi – took an awkward fall and hobbled off court after 11 minutes of play.England finish their group top and will now face New Zealand in the semi-finals, after the Diamonds defeated the Silver Ferns by a single goal in a stunning morning game. New Zealand had fought back from a six-goal half-time deficit – but Israel Folau could only watch from the stands with everyone else as his wife, Maria, New Zealand’s go-to pressure shooter skimmed the rim with her last-second attempt to draw level.South Africa kept England within two goals until the sixth minute of the game, when a miss from Lenize Potgieter brought a rebound off the baseline. When the ball reached the other end, Harten sent in a long-range shot that screamed confidence. In the centre of the court, Guthrie and Pitman exchanged long balls, and in the D the Housby-Harten pas de deux brought a burst of four unanswered goals. By the end of the quarter, England had 19, the last of them a piece of ridiculous flair from Harten, receiving a long ball on the edge of the circle and plunging it towards the net with one leg cocked coquettishly behind her.South Africa came back stronger after the break, conceding only a two-goal advantage in the third quarter, and even handed England their first quarter defeat of the tournament in the final 15 minutes, as Sigrid Burger scored 11 from 12. But England brought up their half century of goals up with seven and half minutes of play still remaining, and at no point in the second half were the Proteas closer than nine goals.The last round of preliminaries brought this World Cup’s best day of drama, with multiple close fought games including Northern Ireland’s first ever victory against Barbados. In a high-paced, early-morning affair the Warriors missed four first-quarter shots, as well as the chance to take a goal lead into half time. But another battling performance from the captain, Caroline O’Hanlon – who took hits to every part of her body, including her face – inspired her troops. Even a wobble as Barbados halved their six-goal lead with three minutes to play could not deny Northern Ireland their reward of a place in the 9th10th place playoff.Scotland were only a single goal from meeting them in that fixture, after their thriller against Trinidad and Tobago ended in the first draw of the tournament. Forty-five minutes of see-sawing scoreline climaxed in a frenetic final five minutes, Ellie Barrie drawing Scotland level with three consecutive goals – despite twice receiving penalty calls from the umpire that were loudly booed. Trinidad regained the lead with 15 seconds remaining, but Barrie levelled with a shot that reached the net after the hooter sounded. With the two teams finishing Group G on equal footing, a lower goal average means Scotland now play Barbados for the 11th-12th placing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e962100f220dd2a31a19db7ebbda4d32c6e35683/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0f8835003bbe145cb0909a5a1477c83","title":"jb holmes rory mcilroy open","story":"“I don’t feel like I’m the centre of attention,” insisted Rory McIlroy before a ball was struck in this, the 148th Open Championship. Well, he is now – for reasons far removed from the fairytale scenario in which McIlroy would raise the Claret Jug at the venue where he excelled as a 16-year-old. Such a memorable occasion for Northern Ireland instantly lurched towards calamity for one of its most celebrated sons.One of the most extraordinary – and extraordinarily damaging – rounds of McIlroy’s career began with an eight and finished with a seven. The 30-year-old’s 79, eight over par, on the Open’s historic return to Royal Portrush leaves him embroiled in a desperate scrap to make the cut. That last time McIlroy opened golf’s oldest major with this score, in 2013, he lasted only two days. In four subsequent Open appearances before this wounding day on the north coast of Antrim, McIlroy had not carded higher than 71. McIlroy has not so much drifted as sunk, from one of the short-priced Open favourites to a 400-1 outsider. This was not in anyone’s script.It is doubtful whether there has ever been a McIlroy scorecard like this one. It featured two birdies, 12 pars, a bogey, double bogey, triple bogey and quadruple bogey. To his credit, the four-times major winner undertook media duties and sought to explain how the “simple stuff” went awry. Privately, he must be devastated about what transpired in front of such an expectant audience.“I definitely think if I can put the ball in the fairway tomorrow I can shoot a good enough score to be around for the weekend,” said McIlroy. “Obviously I’m pretty sure anyone starting with a 79 in this golf tournament doesn’t think about winning at this point. But I think I can go out there and shoot something in the mid-60s, be around for the weekend, and then try to play good from there.“I didn’t get a very good account of myself out there. And I can definitely play better, as all of you know.” Indeed we do, which made this situation such a head-scratcher. McIlroy did not sugarcoat an “inexcusable” missed putt from tap-in range at the 16th.When walking to the 2nd tee, McIlroy was already eight from the lead. By close of play on a squally day, he sat 13 shots adrift of the front-running JB Holmes. Shane Lowry returned an impressive 67 to lie within one of Holmes’s five-under tally. Holmes has something of a curious Open record, with a third-place finish at Troon in 2016 leaping out among a string of missed cuts and the making up of numbers. In his past six starts on the PGA Tour, Holmes has not lasted beyond Friday.In another unquestionable blow to the profile of the Open’s staging at Portrush for the first time in 68 years, Tiger Woods joined McIlroy in the gallery of infamy. Woods’s struggles, that said, were far less of a surprise. The Masters champion winced at impact on his opening tee shot there was further cause for Woods to grimace as he reached the turn in 41. Woods, unfamiliar with these surroundings and visibly fragile, laboured towards a 78.Pre-tournament, little was made of the fact Lowry had tasted success here, as an amateur in the North of Ireland Championship. The man from Offaly is comfortable on links courses and enjoying one of the finest seasons of his professional career. It would be no shock whatsoever should Lowry at least remain prominent for another three days.“I think four under is a great score on that course and I’ll take it any day,” Lowry said. “I was probably as nervous as I’ve been in quite a while on the 1st tee, almost ever, I’d say.“Look, nerves are a good thing, aren’t they? It’s where you want to be. I just hope I’m nervous on Sunday afternoon out there. It’s right where you want to be and you have to tell yourself that when you’re there. Where would you rather be? Would you rather be here or sitting at home watching on TV?”A string of illustrious names are well placed. Sergio García, Jon Rahm, Alex Noren, Tyrrell Hatton, Tommy Fleetwood and Brooks Koepka are among the group at three under par. Garcia has endured a dismal time in majors since winning one, the Masters of 2017. Koepka’s recent run on the same stages, of course, has been outstanding. “I feel good, I feel very comfortable,” Koepka said. “It’s a major championship this is what you’re trying to peak for.”Scotland has been desperate for a golfing superstar for some time. Further proof that it might have one was delivered by Bob MacIntyre’s joining of the 68 club. The left-hander from Oban held the lead for a brief spell on day one. MacIntyre does not seem remotely fazed by his major debut.Francesco Molinari’s Open defence began with a 74. Adam Scott slumped to a 78. Phil Mickelson’s recently drastic weight loss did not have an instantly positive impact he signed for 76. David Duval attracted attention for all the wrong reasons after taking 14 at the 7th – blow by blow accounts of this debacle would give you a headache – en route to a 91.There was, then, considerably worse than McIlroy. It just did not feel that way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff5940af99d84c4c896a51b2b7f0d1c8395bb362/0_53_2515_1509/master/2515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4f38cdad6e398c8b68fcdb0b9c8b225","title":"simon yates wins stage 12 tour de france cycling","story":"Simon Yates, the winner of the 2018 Vuelta a España, sprinted to victory in Bagnères-de-Bigorre in the French Pyrenees to add a stage win in the Tour de France to those of his in the tours of Italy and Spain.Yates, who is riding the Tour as a support rider to his twin brother Adam, joined a 42-rider breakaway, prior to the first two category one climbs of the day, the Col de Peyresourde and La Hourquette d’Ancizan.After the group dwindled on the climbs, Yates entered the final kilometres with only two other riders, Gregor Mühlberger, of Austria, and Pello Bilbao, of Spain, before dispatching them in the sprint to the line.“I’ve been saving energy until we got here in the mountains and this was the first chance to try something,” Yates said. “Normally, I would be back helping Adam but I had my own chance and grabbed it with both hands. I wasn’t very confident of beating either of them, as I didn’t know how fast they are. But my director said I had to be in front coming round the last corner so I made sure I did that.“I’m very proud of winning stages in all three Grand Tours, hopefully there are more to come. We’ll see if there are more chances this Tour. My main priority is to help Adam. I just had the chance to get up the road today. I’ll see how I am in the next few days.”The Mitchelton-Scott sports director, Matt White, also remains bullish of Adam Yates’s chances of a high overall finish in this year’s race. “He’s in a group of riders who will be challenging for the podium,” the Australian said.“I still think there’s a lot of depth so far between the top seven or eight guys. Adam’s position in the general classification comes with experience. When we came to the Tour in 2016 we knew he was in great shape and he finished fourth as a 23-year-old. So a couple of years down the track he’s matured and so have we, as a team.”But while Mitchelton-Scott celebrated their second stage win, the Bahrain Merida team of the former Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali appeared to be in meltdown after the world time-trial champion, Rohan Dennis, dramatically quit the Tour midway through the stage, on the eve of the inidual time trial in Pau.Dennis, the winner of the time-trial stage in last month’s Tour of Switzerland and the outstanding favourite for the only inidual time trial in this year’s Tour, returned to his team bus at the finish, fended off the media and then quit the race in the company of his agent, only hours after talking positively of his chances of winning the time trial.“I’m disappointed about what happened with Rohan because we expected a big effort from him tomorrow,” his sports director Gorazd Stangelj said. “It was his decision to stop. We tried to speak with him. He said: ‘I don’t want to talk’ and just abandoned the race.”The Bahrain-Merida team have been the subject of some controversy this year in the aftermath of the Operation Aderlass doping investigation, which is ongoing and had connected Milan Erzen, of the team’s management, to the investigation. Erzen has forcefully insisted that any allegations against him are false and unfounded.Asked after Thursday’s stage if there were any other issues that may have led to Dennis’s sudden withdrawal, Stangelj said: “Come on, don’t put words in my mouth.”With five mountain stages still to come in this year’s Tour, the stage 13 inidual time trial centred on Pau will prove pivotal to Geraint Thomas’s hopes of a successful defence.“I’m looking forward to tomorrow,” he said of the time trial. “I’ve seen the course a few times and I’ll see it again in the morning.”Thomas admitted he had been biding his time until the “race of truth”. “It’s been quite hard, waiting and waiting, but tomorrow I’ll get to go all in,” he said. “I’ve ridden it already three times and I like it. It’s fast and it should be hard. It’s going to be a big day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e22a75f38e9eb591c85b4fd8039f267658221c6b/0_455_6418_3851/master/6418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d39ebf9a0879605f3c24a38dfa54e1c3","title":"team gb biggest team overseas olympics 2020","story":"Great Britain is on course to send its biggest team to an overseas Olympics, with the aim of staying in the “upper echelons” of the medal table at Tokyo 2020.The GB Paralympic team is predicted to total 250 athletes, a decrease on 2016 of 265.As previously revealed by the , the British team is also expected to feature more women than men for the first time.

The ICC’s announcement has thrown their participation in both events into doubt.The ICC chairman Shashank Manohar said: “We do not take the decision to suspend a member lightly, but we must keep our sport free from political interference.“What has happened in Zimbabwe is a serious breach of the ICC constitution and we cannot allow it to continue unchecked,” Manohar added. “The ICC wants cricket to continue in Zimbabwe in accordance with the ICC constitution.”An official statement from the ICC has urged “that the elected Zimbabwe Cricket Board be reinstated to office within three months”, with the matter to be considered again at a board meeting in October.“The ICC board heard from both the sports and recreation committee representatives of the Zimbabwe government, and Zimbabwe Cricket before making their decision,” the statement added.At the same meeting, the ICC also approved the introduction of concussion replacements, effective from the first men’s Ashes Test, and a new way of fining players for slow over-rates, with fines now spread across a team and captains no longer at the mercy of suspensions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ae25ae20f6872b21a25761e3122e988d65e1dc8/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89803d64d970ae2f3f03ebc6389e4101 480w","title":"our church review","story":"Watermill, NewburyMarietta Kirkbride’s play about a village torn over forgiving a sex offender convincingly channels older voices The #MeToo movement has inspired a number of plays giving voice to the victims of sexual predation. Now comes drama tackling the inner lives of sex offenders themselves, the most prominent of these being Downstate, a Steppenwolf and National Theatre co-production, and David Mamet’s current West End play, Bitter Wheat.Marietta Kirkbride’s Our Church is far quieter and more English than either of these. It is set in a fictional village that could be the backwaters of Ambridge. Three church committee members eat Hobnobs and discuss parish matters, from dwindling volunteers (“We need fresh blood”) to a diseased pear tree, a renegade cow and a game of croquet for villagers.It is only when June (Kirsty Cox) nominates a churchgoer called Tom to be part of the group that their conversation becomes charged. Tom is a convicted sex offender who was caught with downloaded images of underage girls. Now elderly, the sustained suspicion towards him in the village is aired by Michael (Robert East, who doubles excellently as Tom) and Anne (Susan Tracy).Kirkbride’s script is a blend of convincingly naturalistic dialogue with comic edges and thorny conversations tackling the difficulties around rehabilitation and Christian forgiveness, particularly between Tom and Anne, who has her own history of abuse and is played by Tracy with a dialled-down spiky nervousness.While it does not have the dramatic complexity of Downstate, Nik Partridge’s production captures the awkward reckoning and reconciliation process between abuser and abused. At times, it treads a fine line between potent drama and debating society rhetoric but it never slips into judgment, and Tom’s argument – that he can only do good in society if that society begins to trust him again – is a powerful one.What is extraordinary is that Our Church is constructed for the small communities it reflects. It has toured 17 village halls and arts centres, and Anna Orton’s set of a church hall has an airy, minimal quality.There is something very brave about a young writer channelling elderly voices, and Kirkbride does so excellently. It is, in the end, a focused study, perhaps too light on plot, but with a power that lies in its quiet, emotional understatement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a51a6fd5852eaf21033b5bc9bb8dad6d4390471b/58_354_2715_1629/master/2715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bacd887b53eea28d4d3e4c9946b8fef6","title":"sheila atim anguis game of thrones cleopatra edinburgh fringe","story":"Soon to star in the Game of Thrones prequel, the Olivier-winning actor presents Anguis at the Edinburgh fringe‘The last thing I did in any kind of creative-writing capacity would have been my English GCSE,” Sheila Atim laughs. The 28-year-old actor, who won an Olivier award for the Bob Dylan musical Girl from the North Country and has landed a role in the hotly anticipated Game of Thrones prequel, has now turned writer. Her debut play, Anguis, is at the Edinburgh fringe this summer.“A producer approached me, initially in a music capacity,” she tells me over the phone during a rare break in her hectic schedule. Atim is a multi-instrumentalist and composed Time Is Love, Che Walker’s production at the Finborough earlier this year. “I thought, ‘Right, let me think if there is anyone in history that I’m interested in.’ Cleopatra came up, and I did a bit of reading about her.” The music project soon turned into a play instead when the producer asked if she would like to write it, Atim thought: “‘Yeah, why not?!’ And then it’s like ‘Oh. Wait …’ But it’s Edinburgh and that’s the whole point, it’s all about experimentation, emerging artists.” Can an Olivier award-winner call themselves an emerging artist? “Absolutely!”Set in the modern day, Anguis is, according to Atim, “basically a long conversation” between Cleopatra and an immunologist called Kate Williams. The two women are recording a podcast. “Cleopatra’s got some things in her story that we are not sure whether they are true, so we’re discussing a lot of the Cleopatra we’ve come to know versus who she might have actually been. Secondly, Kate is going through an event in her life with large political and social ramifications, so she’s having to navigate that.”Recently, Atim has explored how the online age means we are responding faster to the world around us, a theme that runs through Anguis. “There’s less time and space to exist in the kind of ‘I don’t know’ ambiguous place where we do all our decision-making.” Instead, she thinks, “within five minutes of hearing about something, you must have made a decision on how you feel about it, how are you going to deal with it, what you’re going to tweet”.Her rising profile means she does a lot of interviews. “I get asked questions on things and I’m very clear in those interviews that I don’t know, if I don’t know or haven’t worked it out yet.” It feels meta to ask if she worries about being interviewed, but I do anyway. “No, I don’t. I’m aware of certain pitfalls or whatever, but I’ve got nothing to hide, and I’m not ashamed of anything that I think or feel. I do like talking about things.” Her Essex accent has some humour in it. “Yeah, don’t worry. I’m not freaking out. I’m not going to hang up!”Born in Uganda, Atim grew up in Essex with her mother, and caught the acting bug in school. Almost 6ft tall, she did some modelling as a teen, toyed with being a doctor and studied biomedical science at King’s in London. Her early roles included Che Walker’s The Lightning Child at the Globe and a lot of Shakespeare. She was in Phyllida Lloyd’s Donmar Trilogy and played a riveting Emilia in Othello opposite Mark Rylance and Andre Holland. But she’s perhaps better known for her roles as the haunting, silent Woman in Les Blancs at the National theatre in 2016, and in Girl from the North Country a year later.These days, she’s recognised “a lot more often than I thought I would be”, and the Thrones TV prequel – which she “can’t talk about yet” – hasn’t even been released. Fans don’t know when the pilot will air, but after a casting announcement in January, we know Atim will have a major role. Since she is doing more work on TV, does she have hopes to write for screen, too? She laughs. “I’m going to see how this is received first. Honestly, I’m the sort of person who’ll take the L, right? If everyone says it’s rubbish, I’ll be like, ‘Do you know what, fair enough mate.’ I can’t do everything.”Saying that, she has enjoyed the writing process. “I’ve had moments where I’ve gone, ‘Oh my God, what am I doing? Delete, delete, delete.’ But the team have been really reassuring, and I’ve got a lot of friends who are writers and they’ve all said that’s completely normal.” She seems proud of Anguis and calls it “genuinely thought-provoking in a time where I think we do need to pause and think – this play gives us time that we don’t necessarily give ourselves to think about things”. She’s currently doing rewrites, and despite her busy acting schedule, aims to get to Edinburgh to see it. “I am really excited. I’m just also terrified, but that’s all part of it, and those two feelings are almost the same thing sometimes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec97e9e3d06571577d025708275647326617b56/0_2761_2320_1390/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70a4f392b0a7337c58c0b1c3dea4ba40","title":"whats the best mini laptop for youtube and writing reports","story":"Peter wants a mini-laptop to go with his old BlackBerry phone. What are his options? I’m old-school now at 71, but I’m still designing and working as a consultant. I had nothing but BlackBerry smartphones for years. Then it all went wrong. My boring Samsung J-something does most things but I miss my BlackBerry. I found an old one in a drawer, and it fits nicely in my pocket when off out. However, when I’m in a coffee place or relaxing, I’d like a big screen for YouTube, WhatsApp links, and writing reports. I’m thinking of rebooting my nice small BlackBerry and putting a smallish mini-laptop in my bag. Any thoughts? PeterBlackBerry lost its premier position in the market – when its phones were used by everyone from Paris Hilton to then US president Barack Obama – but you can still buy BlackBerry phones. The company licensed its name and technology to China’s TCL Communication Technology Holdings Limited (TCT), which sells phones under the TCL, BlackBerry Mobile and Alcatel brand names. It also makes TV sets, soundbars, headphones, air conditioners and dehumidifiers. (The BlackBerry name has also been used by Optiemus Infracom, selling phones as BlackBerry Mobile India, and BB Merah Putih, which briefly served the Indonesian market.)In 2013, BlackBerry tried to replace its original operating system with a new version, BlackBerry 10, based on the QNX operating system it bought in 2010. This is used in the BlackBerry Classic and BlackBerry Passport smartphones. However, in 2015, it started to move to Google Android with the Priv and DTEK50 models.You can still buy BlackBerry Mobile phones in the UK, including ones with physical keyboards, but they all run Android. While they have security and other features that could appeal to businesses, consumers can buy faster Android phones with bigger screens for less money.In the good old days, many of us carried Palm and Compaq iPaq PDAs (personal digital assistants) that enabled us to work on the move. The Psion Series 5 was a classic because it had such a good keyboard. The last one I had was, I think, an HP Jornada 720 with a 6.5in colour screen. It was great for writing, and much less cumbersome than my old Filofax.I don’t think PDAs will ever retake the mass market, because large smartphones and small tablets have filled that hole. However, there is still some interest in mini-laptops, which can now reach enthusiasts via Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns.The Gemini PDA, from UK-based Planet Computers, is an attempt to recreate something like the Psion Series 5. The basic machine does the same job for £499 – you can type while on the move – but there’s a £599 version that also works as a 4G smartphone.The Gemini has a 6in screen and runs Android, so it could be a good alternative to a standard Android phone with a 6in to 6.5in screen and a Bluetooth keyboard. It also dual-boots to Linux, so you can run full web browsers and productivity software such as LibreOffice. Unfortunately for those of us who live in Microsoft Office, it doesn’t run Windows 10, which is a bit of a shame as Microsoft’s operating system is free on small-screen devices.All of these mini-laptops have a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, so they can run Windows 10 properly. (Old-style 7in netbooks – popular between 2007 and 2011 – had 1024 x 768-pixel screens.) But you would have to use scaling to make text comfortable to read.Netbooks succeeded because the versions with 7in screens, 1GB of memory and a cut-price version of Windows XP were familiar enough to be accessible, and they were cheap. However, most people wanted bigger screens – they quickly increased to about 10in – more memory and more storage. This closed the price gap to “proper” laptops, and the netbook market collapsed.Most of today’s mini-laptops and convertibles now have even bigger screens, typically from 11.6in to 14in. I have 10.1in, 11.6in and 12in convertibles, and I’ve found that the combination of the extra screen area and higher resolution makes a worthwhile difference to usability. However, at 12in and above, you start to lose portability.Any of these would slip in your bag, while also being capable of doing real work writing reports.Have you got a question?

It shows the government takes these events really seriously.”Wendy Hawk, interim CEO of the charity Women in Sport,said she supported the announcement, but urged the government to include more women’s sporting events.“Visibility is crucial in helping to raise the profile of women’s sport but also to normalise it, breaking down gender stereotypes through inspirational and positive role models – all of which is vital for grassroots sport participation and engaging the next generation of girls,” she added.The culture secretary has the power to add to or remove from the list at any time, although it is largely unchanged from 1998. Under the terms of the law, broadcast rights to these events must be offered to the main free-to-air terrestrial broadcasters on “fair and reasonable terms”.The government made clear it has no desire for a wholesale reappraisal of the list, meaning there is no prospect of the government forcing cricket to return to free-to-air services despite the success of Sky’s decision to allow the Cricket World Cup final to be shown on Channel 4.Instead the focus will be on ensuring equality between men’s and women’s sports, while bringing disability sport in line with its able-bodied equivalents.The success of the BBC’s Women’s World Cup coverage and Channel 4’s Paralympics coverage have raised the prospect of commercial pay-TV providers being interested in buying broadcast rights in future.Mike Sharrock, chief executive of the British Paralympic Association, said: “ We have been advocating for some time that the Paralympic Games should be treated in the same way as the Olympic Games and always be available on free-to-air TV. This is a significant moment for a nation that is proud to be the home of Paralympic sport.”Earlier this month Ofcom changed the rules stipulating which channels count as free-to-air, meaning providers can meet their requirements by showing events on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four, CBBC, CBeebies, BBC News, BBC Parliament, ITV, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, Channel 4, More 4 and Film 4.Group A – live coverage must be offered to free-to-air broadcastersGroup B – live coverage can be provided by pay-TV broadcasters as long as highlights packages are offered to free-to-air broadcasters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01354784c6b62aa195db3a4ec31d7c125d9769fb/708_449_4908_2945/master/4908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91e5e7a5da0b5caebbcf6c7570dc74e6","title":"g7 leaders to back tech revolution for african women","story":"World leaders to back call to help rural poor and women access mobile bankingWorld leaders are to pledge to shape the technological revolution sweeping through Africa by acting to lift the threat of 400 million predominantly rural women being excluded from digital financial services.G7 finance ministers meeting in France are to endorse a paper from the Gates Foundation saying there is a serious risk that digital technology and mobile banking will bypass millions of women in Africa, leaving them disempowered for a generation.The initiative, requiring $255m (£205m) in initial funding and regulatory action across Africa,is designed to prevent “the inequalities of the past being insinuated into the future” as cultural and market barriers lead to women being excluded from mobile banking, e-commerce and smartphone technology.Speaking to the  before addressing finance ministers on Thursday, Melinda Gates, co-founder of the world’s largest private charitable organisation, argued that the G7 should not see digital inclusion as a small step but comparable with its past efforts to address malaria or debt.“Digital financial services is not a lever we had 15 years ago. We have it now. Yet the mobile phone operators are going to pick off the low-hanging fruit, the middle class,” she said. “They are not going to go the extra mile to help the poor or women. We are already seeing these gaps that are going to set back women’s empowerment.“We know from good research that when a woman has her own digital financial bank account, she often moves from the informal farming sector to the formal entrepreneurial sector. When they have assets in their hands, women often invest differently from their husbands. They invest in health and their kids’ education. When women are empowered, economies are lifted out of poverty.“Yet too many women are stuck in the era of the moneylender and the forced chicken sale.”The Gates Foundation argues that as the technology revolution is only just taking root in Africa, the opportunity still exists to shape a modern financial system from its foundations to include and empower everyone.“The old financial system was built to exclude. It excluded the poor, whose transactions were too small to matter. It excluded the rural, who lived too far away from bank branches. It excluded women, whose husbands were supposed to make the decisions,” Gates wrote in the paper to the G7. “It is very hard to retrofit an exclusive system to be inclusive.”Barriers that need addressing include the extent of mobile phone coverage, the inter-operability of technology, proof of identity, regulation and laws that exclude women.Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister and host of the G7, said all these reforms needed backing. “Giving women access to a bank account is key to faster growth in the poorest countries. Our theme at the G7 is addressing inequalities, and this helps,” he said.Although by the end of 2018 nearly 250 million Africans subscribe to the mobile internet, more than three-quarters – 750 million – were still offline, including more than 400 million people for whom there is no mobile broadband.One of the key historic barriers to financial inclusion identified in the report is the relatively primitive type of mobile banking system that only allows money to be transferred between users of the same mobile service.As a result, the majority of digital transactions are still peer-to-peer money transfers within the same network.This means, the report says, “a healthcare worker who receives her wages in a closed-loop mobile money account is likely to withdraw funds in cash – often travelling long distances and incurring fees – to buy food for her family, pay her bills, and send money to her son who lives in a neighbouring country”.The report also suggests difficulties need to be overcome to ensure secure proof of identification, an issue the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, will highlight at the G7 by offering £15m to help fund a World Bank initiative on secure ID systems.Cultural or religious resistance to women’s financial independence is a further barrier, the report says. In Cameroon, Chad, Gabon and Niger formal regulations exist that prevent women from opening a bank account in the same way as men. “All countries have reasons culturally or historically to hold women back,” Gates said. “It takes forward-thinking people at the top and at the grassroots to lead change.”The Gates team believes the digital revolution is not so advanced in Africa that the emerging inequalities are irreversible. Nearly half of people in sub-Saharan Africa who are paid a salary receive their wages in cash, and less than a third pay utility bills through an account.The potential future scale of the transformation is startling. The consultants McKinsey estimate that by 2025 digital financial services could allow 1.6 billion people worldwide to enter the formal economy and could add $3.7tn to the annual GDP of emerging markets.Digital financial inclusion could create nearly 95m new jobs and provide up to $2.1tn in loans for iniduals to start businesses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7c71e99c76327c89d89d33f3a3796f438cda839/0_269_4489_2694/master/4489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c05767f85103277732a1ab9bb945c99","title":"un urged to act over purge of turkeys lawyers by erdogan","story":"Law Society leads alert over ‘systematic undermining’ of judiciary system and fair trialsTrust in Turkey’s justice system is being undermined by the systematic dismissal and jailing of thousands of judges and prosecutors, an international coalition of lawyers has said.The purge of officials launched by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government in the wake of a failed coup in 2016 has led to suspects being convicted of terrorism “without credible evidence”, according to the Law Society, which has coordinated a submission to the UN.There were already concerns about human rights violations prior to the failed coup in July 2016, the submission states, but since then the judiciary’s independence has been violated through the arbitrary arrest, detention and prosecution of lawyers.In all, 4,260 judges and prosecutors have been dismissed. Of these, 634 were convicted on terrorism charges, the Law Society says. A further 1,546 lawyers have been prosecuted and 311 sentenced to a total of 1,967 years in prison.The report is backed by the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute, the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales, Lawyers’ Rights Watch Canada, the Paris Bar Human Rights Institute, the European Association of Lawyers for Democracy and World Human Rights, the human rights committee of the Norwegian Bar Association, and other legal organisations.Simon Davis, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales, said: “Judges’ and prosecutors’ independence has been systematically undermined in Turkey since the failed coup in 2016. Lawyers who can still practise report intimidation and threats.“This menacing environment undermines the right of every citizen to legal representation and a fair trial, which may explain why Turkish citizens submitted more than 57,000 petitions to the European court of human rights in 2017. But that court will only take on cases where every domestic remedy has been exhausted, and it does not yet recognise that Turkish citizens have no effective domestic remedy, so they are being sent back to the Turkish courts in their thousands.”Approximately 500 administrative personnel working for Turkey’s supreme court, the council of state, court of accounts and council of judges and prosecutors have been also dismissed, and only eight have been reinstated.The report sent to the UN says: “Numerous legislative and constitutional amendments have given the government of Turkey unprecedented control over the judiciary and prosecutorial authorities, thereby undermining judicial and prosecutorial independence, as well as the rule of law.The Turkish embassy press office in London has been contacted for comment.

We have a good withdrawal agreement,” she said in an exclusive interview with the  and four other European newspapers.Both of the contenders to succeed May, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have vowed to renegotiate the exit deal with the EU, declaring that the most controversial component, the Northern Ireland backstop, is unacceptable.When asked about their position, Von der Leyen said the withdrawal agreement was “not dead”. She said: “No, it is a good agreement, which was negotiated properly in accordance with the red lines drawn by the British government.”She reiterated her view that the EU should consider extending the current Brexit deadline of 31 October if there were “good reasons” to do so. “A Brexit without a deal comes with massively negative consequences for both sides, not to mention what it means for Ireland. That’s why we need to do everything to strive for an orderly Brexit. And that’s why if there are good reasons for an extension coming from our British friends, I am open to listening to them.”She added: “It would be wrong to see Brexit only as the end of something. The way in which we carry out Brexit will determine our future relationship to our neighbour the United Kingdom. For both sides it is of the highest interest that there is an orderly and good beginning to our future relationships.”In a wide-ranging interview conducted inside the defence ministry in Berlin that she presided over for six years, Von der Leyen told the Europa group of newspapers that the EU would show solidarity with member states hardest hit by a disorderly British exit.In 2012, six major European newspapers came together to launch joint editorial projects to dig deeper into pan-European issues, understand the EU better and investigative the good and bad things emerging from the continent. Since then, we have jointly investigated the environment, youth unemployment, Brexit, immigration, euroscepticism, the eurozone the Brussels bureaucracy - and even the legacies of the first world war. We have interviewed prime ministers and presidents, as well as a host of EU leaders, and will continue our efforts long after Britain has left the EU.The six papers are , Le Monde, Süddeutsche Zeitung, La Vanguardia, La Stampa and Gazeta WyborczaShe said a European unemployment benefit reinsurance scheme, modelled on measures put in place in Germany to cushion the blow of the world financial downturn a decade ago, could be rolled out across the bloc of 27 nations.In 2008 the German government prevented massive job cuts through a state-subsidised programme to finance reduced working hours. “We can apply this idea to the whole of Europe,” said Von der Leyen. “Should an external shock such as a disorderly Brexit hit two or three countries particularly hard, for example, the unemployment reinsurance scheme could come into force.”One recent report said a no-deal Brexit could do massive harm, especially to the economy in Ireland where it could cost £6bn and lead to an estimated increase in unemployment of 50,000 to 55,000.Asked whether Ireland could be one of the countries to benefit from such emergency help in the case of a no-deal Brexit, Von der Leyen said: “I can’t predict that. But it is right for Europe to help the member states who are hit hardest.”A mother of seven who has held ministerial posts under the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, since 2005, Von der Leyen became the commission’s first female president-elect on Tuesday, winning a vote in the European parliament with the support of 383 MEPs, only nine votes more than required to secure an absolute majority. Critics say the vote has left her at the mercy of nationalists and populists in Poland and Italy who supported her candidacy.“The work is only about to begin,” she said. “In my debates with the political groups and national delegations I came across a lot of openness for constructive collaboration, also from the Green parties. Climate change, digitalisation, the economy, Brexit, security, trade, migration – we have work to do.”Von der Leyen, a Christian Democrat, said she believed action on climate to be of the utmost urgency. “The worst-case scenario will come about if we don’t act with determination, namely rapidly intensifying climate change with all its consequences. The clock is ticking, and we have to act.”She added: “Polluting the environment has to come at a price, which will bring about a change in our behaviour and a lowering of CO2 emissions. If you compare it to the rest of the world, then our industry is already doing well at climate-friendly technology, but we have to get better.“But if industry modernises, we also have to protect it from cheap imports produced in environmentally harmful ways outside Europe’s borders. In coal-heavy regions, especially in central and eastern Europe, we have to support the transition to new clean branches of the economy and protect jobs.”Ursula von der Leyen, born in 1958, is the daughter of Heidi and Ernst Albrecht, the latter having been a senior politician in the centre-right Christian Democratic Union who rose to be governor of the state of Lower Saxony.She spent the first 12 years of her life in Brussels, where her father was serving as a commission official. She studied economics at the universities of Göttingen and Münster before attending the London School of Economics where she used the pseudonym Rose Ladson because she was seen as a potential target for West German leftwing extremists.Von der Leyen then read for a medical degree, becoming a gynaecologist, and only entered politics at 42. A mother of seven, she has held government positions as labour and family affairs minister, driving forward key policies on gender quotas for company boards and improved maternity and paternity pay and rights – policies that initially won her considerable popularity.In 2011, Von der Leyen spoke of her desire for a “United States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland,\u0026nbspGermany\u0026nbspor the US”. She has since claimed that Brexit, and the loss of the “pragmatism” of the British in the EU, should propel the bloc towards further integration, and has voiced support for a European army.She is a key ally of Angela Merkel, with whom she has worked since 2005. Like Merkel, she has championed the idea of a close relationship between the EU and UK after Brexit.Von der Leyen, though, has been withering about those who campaigned for Brexit, Describing events since the referendum as a “burst bubble of hollow promises … inflated by populists”. She has cautioned that a no-deal Brexit would be the “worst possible start” to the close long-term EU-UK relationship that Berlin holds desirable.The nicknames she has acquired over the course of her 29-year career in German politics tell their own story. During her time in charge of the family ministry, she was first called\u0026nbspKrippen-Ursel\u0026nbsp(“crèche Ursel”), a conservative closet feminist set on expanding nursery places, and then\u0026nbspZensursula, a control freak who wanted to shield German youth from the dark sides of the internet.When she became Germany’s first female defence minister in 2013, her (mostly male) detractors referred to her as\u0026nbspFlinten-Uschi\u0026nbsp(“shotgun Uschi”), a caricature of the bossy career woman.As commission president, Von der Leyen will represent the EU on the world stage, and a key task will be building a working relationship with Donald Trump’s White House. She has previously criticised a lack of strategy in Trump’s approach to Vladimir Putin’s Russia and has suggested the US president’s frosty relationship with Merkel is based on his outdated view of women.She indicated a more nuanced approach towards states such as Poland and Hungary, which have been brazenly challenging the EU consensus on issues such as migration, the rule of law and press freedom.“I think we have to properly listen to the arguments. For example, the Poles make the justified point that they have taken in 1.5 million people from the Ukraine – a country that has for years been the site of a hybrid war in which people are still dying. We must not ignore that. Among Brexiters, Von der Leyen has been characterised as a cartoon Eurocrat intent on building “a centralised, undemocratic, updated form of communism”, as the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, said in the parliament. She once told an interviewer that her dream was “a united states of Europe – run along the lines of the federal states of Switzerland, Germany or the USA”.Asked whether her dream had changed since then, she said: “It has become more mature and more realistic. In the European Union we have unity in ersity. That is something different to federalism. I think that is the right path.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?NHS flu jabs delayed amid scramble to keep up with \u0026#39Aussie\u0026#39 strain How Philip Hammond delivered his final act of rebellion on the steps of No 11US has shot down Iranian drone in Strait of Hormuz, says TrumpComment: Community is the first line of defence against all forms of extremismPhilip Hammond orchestrates Tory no-deal rebellion in Brexit parting shotComment: There may well be an economic cost to no-deal – but plenty of people want it anywayOxford\u0026#39s admission problem is because state school fail to push their brightest pupils, vice chancellor suggestsThere will be no repeat of April gridlock in London, police chief warns Extinction Rebellion A quarter of police forces have just one or fewer women in their top ranks, figures showWild Justice is attempting to strangle game shooting industry with latest legal challenge, say campaignersSchoolboy, 14, collapses and dies during end of term trip to an assault courseMan unable to reach dying father’s bedside after getting stuck in Extinction Rebellion trafficDonald Trump disavows ‘send her back’ chants at his rally about congresswoman Ilhan OmarThousands of offences could be prevented by scrapping short jail sentences, says Justice SecretaryScottish income tax £941 million short of forecast as Westminster bails out HolyroodRAF moving closer to becoming an air and space force, Penny Mordaunt saysKnife crime soars in rural areas by as much as 50 per cent as violence epidemic spreads out of citiesJeremy Hunt warns Britons won\u0026#39t forgive EU for a generation if there is a no-deal BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"music photographer denis oregancaptures glamour rock n roll","story":"As one of Britain’s top rock photographers over the past 45 years, Denis O’Regan has collaborated with legendary artists including David Bowie, Queen and the Rolling Stones, creating iconic images and capturing both the grit and the glamour of rock star life.

It has been there since the Dark Ages and there is very strong public interest in ensuring its survival in its present form.”It is hard to believe Pugh was not aware of the dyke’s historical and tourism value, the judge said. “Your actions meant that a significant archaeological site may have been lost,” he added.The court heard that in January 2018 a member of the public reported damage to Offa’s Dyke – which is named after the eighth-century king of Mercia who built it – where it runs through Mr Pugh’s farm in Powys, North Wales.Scenic: the historic Offa\u0026#39s DykePugh admitted he removed a hedge and fence to create a crossing point, but blamed sheep for causing most of the damage. He later admitted that his farming machinery contributed to it.The farmer pleaded guilty to a charge of damaging an ancient monument and was fined £1,500 with £500 costs and a £150 surcharge.Matthew Curtis, defending, said his client had spent around £2,000 trying to repair the dyke.NHS flu jabs delayed amid scramble to keep up with \u0026#39Aussie\u0026#39 strain How Philip Hammond delivered his final act of rebellion on the steps of No 11US has shot down Iranian drone in Strait of Hormuz, says TrumpComment: Community is the first line of defence against all forms of extremismPhilip Hammond orchestrates Tory no-deal rebellion in Brexit parting shotComment: There may well be an economic cost to no-deal – but plenty of people want it anywayOxford\u0026#39s admission problem is because state school fail to push their brightest pupils, vice chancellor suggestsThere will be no repeat of April gridlock in London, police chief warns Extinction Rebellion A quarter of police forces have just one or fewer women in their top ranks, figures showWild Justice is attempting to strangle game shooting industry with latest legal challenge, say campaignersSchoolboy, 14, collapses and dies during end of term trip to an assault courseMan unable to reach dying father’s bedside after getting stuck in Extinction Rebellion trafficDonald Trump disavows ‘send her back’ chants at his rally about congresswoman Ilhan OmarThousands of offences could be prevented by scrapping short jail sentences, says Justice SecretaryScottish income tax £941 million short of forecast as Westminster bails out HolyroodRAF moving closer to becoming an air and space force, Penny Mordaunt saysKnife crime soars in rural areas by as much as 50 per cent as violence epidemic spreads out of citiesJeremy Hunt warns Britons won\u0026#39t forgive EU for a generation if there is a no-deal BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/15/TELEMMGLPICT000203853505_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"man unable reach dying fathers bedside getting stuck extinction","story":"Protesters from Extinction Rebellion on a boat they have parked outside the Royal Courts of Justice in LondonA man was unable to reach his dying father’s bedside before he passed away after an Extinction Rebellion protest on the motorway left him stuck in traffic.An unknown man rang his local radio station to reveal how he rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary after doctors told him his father did not have long left to live but he did not get there in time because climate change protesters were blocking the M32 into the city. Extinction Rebellion have been blocking key roads in Bristol and other cities since Monday as part of a week-long protest. 16 members of the group have been arrested in the city.As part of their wider protest, of the group\u0027s infamous boats was parked on The Strand in London outside the Royal Courts of Justice.

No human has ventured there – or even outside of low-Earth orbit – since.With great difficulty. Which in turn was overcome by hard work and ingenuity, as part of\u0026nbspthe culmination of thousands of years of human curiosity.Why some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThe Moon is, obviously, a long way away: about 250,000 miles. And getting there also means leaving Earth\u0027s powerful gravity, which is just as difficult, pulling anything down and requiring vast power.That power came in the form of the Saturn V rocket, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever made, and arguably the most mighty piece of machinery that humanity has ever put together.On top sat the three astronauts, in a much smaller capsule. The rocket carried the astronauts up into space, but it was this capsule that would carry them to the Moon and back, once they had managed to escape Earth.That capsule, known as the command service module, was actually made up of three parts: the command module, that served as the astronauts\u0027\u0026nbsphome through the mission, the service module that contained the bits that powered them through space and kept them alive, and the lunar module.It was only that latter part that ever made its way to the Moon\u0027s surface, after detaching from the rest and touching down on the ground. After Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had explored the Moon, they climbed back into the ascent stage part of that lunar module and used it to fly back up and attach to the main craft, which was being piloted by their colleague Michael Collins.They would then gradually float back to Earth, crashing down to land and completing their mission successfully.There was never any one justification for heading to the Moon. And many people thought we should head there for no reason at all – just because we can, and therefore should.But there was another pressing reason: because other people could. The Moon landing was the crescendo of the Space Race, which had seen the US battle with the Soviet space programme to get to a range of different milestones.That didn\u0027t start with the Moon. Both countries – embroiled at the same time in the Cold War – flung rockets, satellites, animals and people into space to demonstrate their power, and putting a man on the Moon became the inevitable conclusion of that work.All of those various aims and desires came wrapped together in a speech given by John F Kennedy in 1961, which helped launch the race for the Moon and set down the reasons for doing so.I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth, he said.\u0026nbspNo single space project in this period will be more exciting, or more impressive, or more important for the long-range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.Getting there helped improve science in myriad ways. A variety of breakthroughs came as a result of the work done to get humanity to the Moon, and when the astronauts touched down they also helped with scientific work in unprecedented ways – they gathered up Moon rocks, left behind sensors, and even the ways that their bodies responded to the stress and strangeness of space was studied to give information that is still being studied to this day.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a miracle, and one made so powerful because it was so very unlikely.It was hailed as an incredible success.\u0026nbspBut the chance of failure was such that authorities had to prepare for the possibility of losing the astronauts.Those preparations offer a humbling insight into how risky that mission was, and how high the stakes were.Probably the most potent document from those preparations is the speech that would have been used to hail the bravery of the astronauts as they were left to their death on the Moon.It was written to announce to the world that the astronauts had been lost, and that the Moon mission was a failure. After it was read, the two astronauts would be given a ceremony something like the burial at sea, but one entirely without precedent.Created with Sketch.

But over time it became public, after being revealed by the man who wrote it, and is now available for the public to read.It was prepared in the case that the astronauts and their moon lander failed to get back to the main craft that was floating around in the Moon\u0027s orbit ready to bring them home, and contained Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u0027s\u0026nbspcolleague Michael Collins.Everything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingIn that case, it was most likely that those pioneering explorers would not lose their lives in a single spectacular moment. Instead, they would most likely be stranded, stuck 250,000 miles from Earth with no way of getting back home.In the end, and despite some very anxious moments, the crew would explore the lunar surface and come back down safely. That meant that, instead of announcing their loss, Nixon could instead share in the astronaut\u0027s success.In one of the most famous moments of the mission, he spoke to them in a phone call that was beamed around the world. He recognised the triumph of their achievement, and wished them safety for their return.Hello, Neil and Buzz, he said during that phone call.\u0026nbspI\u0027m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House.And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.

Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply.The stress test is by no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal Brexit, it added.\u0026nbspSpeaking at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Chantilly, France, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt –\u0026nbspa recession caused by a no-deal Brexit.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersBut that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy. The OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal, the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.”Detailing the less drastic IMF scenario it examined, the OBR said the possible recession would start in the fourth quarter of 2019 and last a year.\u0026nbspGDP adjusted for inflation would decline by 2.1 per cent by late 2020, around the same as in the\u0026nbspearly-1990s\u0026nbspeconomic slump and about a third of the fall during\u0026nbspthe financial crisis.The effects of the recession would be long-lasting, with real GDP 4 per cent lower by the middle of 2021 compared with the\u0026nbspOBR\u0027s\u0026nbsplatest economic forecasts released in mid-March, before the last Brexit deadline. Despite a recovery, it would still be\u0026nbsp1.6 per cent smaller by early 2024.Government debt would rise relative to GDP over the next three years and the budget deficit would widen by around £30bn from 2020-21 onwards, the report said.The economy is heading towards the 31 October Brexit deadline already weakened.The latest data and surveys suggest the economy flatlined at best in the second quarter, the OBR said.\u0026nbspSome of this is likely to be a ‘pay-back’ after Brexit-related stock building in the first quarter. But surveys were particularly weak in June, suggesting that the pace of growth is likely to remain weak. This raises the risk that the economy may be entering a full-blown recession.Fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen in the last few days after the two contenders to become Britain\u0027s next prime minister promised to scrap the Irish backstop, deemed indispensable by the EU. Their comments on Tuesday sent the pound to its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years.Additional reporting by Andrew WoodcockOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Alternatives\u0026nbspmust scale up to meet demandClick to followThe IndependentEmma Back has spent three years developing her idea for the\u0026nbspsocial care platform the Equal Care Co-op (or eccoo) and growing the business to a size where it can attract major funding. But unlike other startups vying for the attention of venture capitalists, Back and her co-founders are raising money through community shares on Ethex, which calls itself an ethical crowdfunding platform, and shunning venture capital that would force them to grow as fast as possible to generate returns.“There’s definitely such a thing as having too much money,” Back says. Rather than raising money to employ salespeople, the Equal Care Co-op is raising money to train and employ people within communities to organise and manage care.\u0026nbsp“Other care platforms have massive advertising budgets, so instead of community relationships it’s all about customer conversion,” Back says. “It gives people a transactional perception of their work in the world. We’re not going to be employing salespeople, we will be employing carers and people who understand their community from the ground up. That will make us resilient, not sitting there with a VP of marketing for our community campaign.”Startups are increasingly looking for alternatives to venture capital funding that leads them to choose between selling up, going public\u0026nbspor going bust. Stefano Bernardi, a founder and investor working as an angel scout for Atomico, says there has been some experimentation in alternative models, but nowhere near the scale needed to meet demand from startups. \u0026nbspHow to protect your freedom in the stupid game of capitalismVenture capitalists invested more than £1.19bn in UK startups in the first three months of 2019, according to\u0026nbspKPMG. The money was invested across 161 deals, including £150m for iwoca, a financial technology company, and £58m for\u0026nbspGoCardless, a direct-debit payment company, to expand the company overseas. “Late stage” companies like these two find it much easier to attract investment because they are generally considered to be beyond their startup-phase and have a better-established business model.This means that entrepreneurs who want to grow a business fast and then exit at a profit have a harder time attracting early investment. It can put greater pressure on founders to squeeze margins at the expense of wages, company culture and even the vision that they set out with. The ultimate goal for many – just like Facebook,\u0026nbspUber\u0026nbspand Google before them – is to grow to a size that when they sell or go public, early investors cash out with huge profits.\u0026nbspBut if a company realises it does not have this kind of potential, it cannot back out of a venture capital deal,\u0026nbspBernardi\u0026nbspsays: “If they find that they have a good business but not monopoly-like, they can either close shop or try to scale anyway and then go bust. Not really a great situation.”In June 2018, Guy Singh-Watson, the founder of vegetable box producer Riverford,\u0026nbspsold 74\u0026nbspper cent of his company to employees. The transition\u0026nbspmeans that idends will be\u0026nbsppassed on to staff rather than to external shareholders, giving them an incentive to make the company more productive.\u0026nbspBut it also makes Riverford practically impossible to sell, because it has so many owners – a fact that many young entrepreneurs, eager for venture capitalist funding to grow fast and then cash out, might find shocking.“When I go to London to meet the bright young food brands of the future, before they have even sold their first smoothie or whatever, they are thinking about how they will exit,” Singh-Watson says. “It makes me really depressed and angry. They are just going to build it and sell it. When I started my business, I did it because I wanted to make something worthwhile.”Lisa Ashford, chief executive of\u0026nbspEthex, says younger founders, in particular, are interested in doing business differently. “They want to access capital that can support them in their mission and many of them are shunning the traditional models of raising finance in favour of models where everyone benefits,” Ashford says.Ethex works with organisations that have a social mission. The platform gives them access to 15,000 investors and several investment structures including ISAs, charity bonds and equity. Ashford says: “Venture capital funding can often be about financial performance and short term returns and exit strategies, sometimes to the detriment of the other impact aspirations of an organisation. That’s not what our investors are about.”In the US, Indie.vc is offering startups a route to profitability without venture capital funding.

Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply.The stress test is by no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal Brexit, it added.\u0026nbspSpeaking at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Chantilly, France, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt –\u0026nbspa recession caused by a no-deal Brexit.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersBut that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy. The OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal, the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.”Detailing the less drastic IMF scenario it examined, the OBR said the possible recession would start in the fourth quarter of 2019 and last a year.\u0026nbspGDP adjusted for inflation would decline by 2.1 per cent by late 2020, around the same as in the\u0026nbspearly-1990s\u0026nbspeconomic slump and about a third of the fall during\u0026nbspthe financial crisis.The effects of the recession would be long-lasting, with real GDP 4 per cent lower by the middle of 2021 compared with the\u0026nbspOBR\u0027s\u0026nbsplatest economic forecasts released in mid-March, before the last Brexit deadline. Despite a recovery, it would still be\u0026nbsp1.6 per cent smaller by early 2024.Government debt would rise relative to GDP over the next three years and the budget deficit would widen by around £30bn from 2020-21 onwards, the report said.The economy is heading towards the 31 October Brexit deadline already weakened.The latest data and surveys suggest the economy flatlined at best in the second quarter, the OBR said.\u0026nbspSome of this is likely to be a ‘pay-back’ after Brexit-related stock building in the first quarter. But surveys were particularly weak in June, suggesting that the pace of growth is likely to remain weak. This raises the risk that the economy may be entering a full-blown recession.Fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen in the last few days after the two contenders to become Britain\u0027s next prime minister promised to scrap the Irish backstop, deemed indispensable by the EU. Their comments on Tuesday sent the pound to its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years.Additional reporting by Andrew WoodcockOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion.

Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.Netflix blamed the drop-off in growth on price rises in the US where\u0026nbspconsumers had to stomach price hikes of between 13 per cent and 18 per cent, depending on which package they have, with the most popular plan now $13 per month.Disney plans to offer its new service, Disney Plus, for just $7 and has deep pockets to fund its expansion.Netflix is banking on a number of hit shows to be released in the second half of 2019 – most notably series three of the immensely popular Stranger Things – to lure more customers.Chief executive Reed Hastings was sanguine about the results. “Sometimes we forecast low, sometimes we forecast high—this is one where we forecasted high,” he said in the company’s video earnings interview. He said it was “easy to over-interpret” the significance of quarterly membership numbers.By traditional measures of company performance Netflix is still growing fast. Price rises helped boost revenue by 26 per cent compared to the same quarter last year while profits exceeded expectations at £709m.Mihir Haria-Shah, head of broadcast at media planning agency Total Media said: “Netflix’s head start means it remains in reasonable health whilst the new services such as Disney Plus get over any early teething issues.\u0026nbsp“The bigger concern for Netflix is what happens further down the line once these new entrants have established themselves. It has essentially built its business on the back of leasing content from other companies and has had great success doing so.\u0026nbsp“Now its content providers are becoming competitors it will have to invest even more into original content as existing deals expire and content is taken off the platform.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  But Instagram seems unlikely to reverse its decision and may even roll it out to even more locations.\u0026nbspWho is affected and why did Instagram do it?Instagram first began trialling the feature in Canada earlier this year, saying it wanted people to worry a little bit less about how many likes they\u0027re getting.The trial has now extended to Australia, Brazil, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand, meaning all users in those countries will no longer be able to see the number of likes and video views a post receives.Senator accuses Facebook of ‘flagrant displays of bulls***\u0027We want your friends to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get, Instagram wrote in a post.The move comes in response to various studies that have found a link between mental health issues and the pressures brought about by social media use.Can you still find out who liked a post?Instagram says the feature is mandatory for all account holders in the seven countries, but even those users will have ways of seeing who likes their own posts.The firm explained: You can still see your own likes by tapping on the list of people who\u0027ve liked it, but your friends will not be able to see how many likes your post has received.arttributed to use of their platforms (Getty Images)If you are not in one of the affected countries, then it is still possible to see the number of likes posts receive from users within those countries.Also, Instagram says it does not mean the era of influencers is over, nor that brands and companies should worry about customer engagement.For businesses and creators on Instagram, this test will not affect measurement tools like Insights or Ads Manager, a spokesperson said.Will the feature spread to other countries?Key markets for Instagram, like the UK and US, remain unaffected but the spread may appear ominous to users in these countries.Despite the trial extending beyond Canada to six other countries, Instagram refuses to confirm the feature is permanent or that it will roll out further.Instead, Instagram said hiding the likes and video views\u0026nbspis a temporary trial and that it will seek feedback before making any further decisions.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The move follows several studies that appeared to link social media pressures with mental health issues.Instagram unveils new anti-bullying feature to discourage trolls“We want Instagram to be a place where people feel comfortable expressing themselves,” said Mia Garlick, Facebook’s head of policy in Australia and New Zealand.“We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive, so you can focus on sharing the things you love.”Not all users are happy with the move, with many taking to social media to complain about how it could affect the income opportunities of influencers.“What about the people using it for income?” one user wrote on Twitter. “The people who work hard creating content, to then have their hard work not praisednot shown how successful it was to others?”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But humanity has been bewitched by our nearest neighbour for far longer than that. David Barnett delves into lunar myth, legend and folkloreClick to followThe IndependentEven a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.”\u0026nbspSo long have we been fascinated by the moon, that bright, progressively changing, ever-present fixture of our night sky, that we could easily believe those lines are some ancient folkish portent, their origins lost in the mists of time.In actual fact they were written by Curt Siodmak, the screenwriter of the 1941 movie The Wolf Man, which terrified audiences as Lon Chaney Jr, attacked by a wolf in darkest Wales, transforms in the silvery light of the full moon into a half-human, half-lupine beast.Even by the time that movie came out, almost three decades before man would walk on the moon, our fascination with Earth’s satellite was already deep-rooted. And why wouldn’t it be? Even to the earliest people, the moon must have been a troubling thing, hanging there in the sky, its face pocked by craters and ridged with mountains, mirroring and echoing the earth, impossibly distant yet close enough to make out its contoured surface. Of the Earth, and yet beyond it, further than mankind could dream of travelling.And yet, if you have no concept of the Earth on which you’re standing, the moon must have seemed stranger still. It’s little wonder that people have always conjured stories about the moon, deified it, given it the characteristics of a living thing.In Romania, they believed that the sun and the moon were siblings, but despite this, the sun desired his sister. To avoid her brother, the moon decided she would only go out at night, when the sun could not bother her.To some of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic circle, the moon was male, and the sun a woman, and they were lovers. Among some Inuit peoples, the moon was a benevolent spirit who welcomed the souls of the dead to other tribes, he was a vengeful being whose wrath was terrible to behold.Created with Sketch.Super snow moon: pictures of 2019\u0027s largest full moon around the world Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A plane flies past the snow moon in Nuremberg, GermanyThe moon lights up the sky behind One World Trade Center in New YorkThe moon setting over Burrow Mump at Burrowbridge in Somerset this morning The snow moon rises over the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las VegasThe moon sets behind Les Jumelles in the Swiss AlpsThe snow moon rises over the banks of the River Loire at Lavau-sur-LoireEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises between columns of the Floesser Bridge in Frankfurt, GermanyThe snow moon in MilanBuddhist monks carry lit candles as the moon rises over the Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple, near BangkokThe snow moon rises over Marina Beach in Chennai, India The snow moon is pictured against street lights of Piazza del Duomo in MilanThe snow moon rises above a construction site in IndiaA ferris wheel is in the foreground as the snow moon rises above Malaga, SpainThe snow moon rises between statues of Alexander the Great and Diogenes of Sinope in Corinth, GreeceThe snow moon rises in Skopje, North MacedoniaThe snow moon rises behind a statue of the Virgin Maty in Skopje, North MacedoniaEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises over the French Mediterranean island of CorsicaThe snow moon rises by the Parthenon in AthensA plane flies in front of the snow moon above LondonThe snow moon rises above the Camlica Mosque in IstanbulThe Madonnina statue of the Virgin Mary atop Milan\u0027s Cathedral is pictured against the snow moon A plane flies past the snow moon in Nuremberg, GermanyThe moon lights up the sky behind One World Trade Center in New YorkThe moon setting over Burrow Mump at Burrowbridge in Somerset this morning The snow moon rises over the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las VegasThe moon sets behind Les Jumelles in the Swiss AlpsThe snow moon rises over the banks of the River Loire at Lavau-sur-LoireEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises between columns of the Floesser Bridge in Frankfurt, GermanyThe snow moon in MilanBuddhist monks carry lit candles as the moon rises over the Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple, near BangkokThe snow moon rises over Marina Beach in Chennai, India The snow moon is pictured against street lights of Piazza del Duomo in MilanThe snow moon rises above a construction site in IndiaA ferris wheel is in the foreground as the snow moon rises above Malaga, SpainThe snow moon rises between statues of Alexander the Great and Diogenes of Sinope in Corinth, GreeceThe snow moon rises in Skopje, North MacedoniaThe snow moon rises behind a statue of the Virgin Maty in Skopje, North MacedoniaEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises over the French Mediterranean island of CorsicaThe snow moon rises by the Parthenon in AthensA plane flies in front of the snow moon above LondonThe snow moon rises above the Camlica Mosque in IstanbulThe Madonnina statue of the Virgin Mary atop Milan\u0027s Cathedral is pictured against the snow moon One time, a Japanese fisherman found a robe made of white feathers on the beach. It belonged to a beautiful woman swimming in the sea. She said she would sing him a song if he returned her robe, for without it she could not go home. He did so and she sang him a hymn to the moon, where she lived, and as she sang her feathered robe became vast white wings, which carried her to her lunar palace.The moon is often considered female, as are the gods who represented it in ancient times. According to the astrologer and occultist Bruce King, who was born in Chicago in 1897 and wrote under the name Zolar:\u0026nbsp“In mythologies worldwide, rulers of the moon are female deities.”Huge, unexplained ‘mass’ spotted under the MoonIn his Encyclopedia of Signs, Omens and Superstitions he lists many of them: “For the Canaanites, the name of the moon goddess was Jerah (for who the city of Jericho was named). For Egyptians, Isis and Hathor were associated with the moon. For the Babylonians, the goddess Ishtar was given similar honours.For the Greeks, Artemis\u0026nbspand Diana\u0026nbsp(hunting goddesses), were both\u0026nbspconnected with the moon as well. Hence, it was not surprising that in medieval Europe, Diana became the patroness of witches, since she already ruled “horned”\u0026nbspanimals such as the stag and goat.Witches, of course, meet by moonlight. Shakespeare’s three witches, or weird sisters, in Macbeth, when cooking up their cooking up their “toil and trouble” in their boiling cauldron, throw in “slips of yew silver’d in the moon’s eclipse”. They are visited by Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft, associated with the moon.Brewer’s Book of Myth and Legend, edited by JC Cooper, tells us that Hecate was the name the Greeks gave to the moon before she had fully risen and after she had set hidden, occult. A crescent moon was identified as Astarte, as Diana or Cynthia when full. The\u0026nbspancients personified the moon as Selene, who fell in love with Endymion, a shepherd, who was put into an immortal sleep by a jealous Zeus.The moon is for lovers, immortalised as such in song:\u0026nbsp“Blue Moon”\u0026nbsp“Give Me The Moonlight”\u0026nbspBeethoven’s Moonlight Sonata. The moon has illuminated lovers’ trysts and in Brazil they say you are only truly in love if you can easily make out the rabbit in the moon, a piece of Chinese-originated folklore that identifies the markings on the face of the full moon as a rabbit.Just as the moon controls the tides of the sea, so it is connected to the bodies of women. In many folk legends, says Zolar:\u0026nbsp“Girls are warned not to stare at the moon or lay in moonlight, or they will be impregnated by the moon and give birth to some kind of monster.”Is there any truth in the old stories that women’s menstrual cycles are linked directly to the moon? The Uaupe tribe of the Amazon refer to a girl’s first menstruation as “defloration by the moon”. The word menstruation is derived from the Latin word menses, meaning “monthly”, and the Greek “mene”, referring to the moon. Science perhaps doesn’t back that up, other than through coincidence the average menstrual cycle is 29 days, the lunar cycle is 29.5 days.Nasa to send spacecraft to Saturn’s moon TitanNasa to open moon rock samples sealed since Apollo missionsElon Musk tweets ‘Occupy Mars’ alongside photo of the MoonAliens could be living on other moons, scientists sayThe moon, of course, only comes out at night...\u0026nbspexcept when it doesn’t. Sometimes we see the pale ghost of the moon in the bright blue sky, because of the passage of the moon around the Earth and, as it gets closer to being a new moon, and at its nearest relative point to the sun, we sometimes see the solar reflection off\u0026nbspthe moon’s surface in broad daylight.But it is generally the dark velvet of the night sky the moon inhabits, which gives it its associations with the occult, and secret things. Charles Walker, in his Encyclopedia of Secret Knowledge, says:\u0026nbsp“The moon is the symbol of the imaginative, reflective, interiorising power in our world. In astrology and alchemy, the moon is an index of the withdrawal principle, and of the subconscious or hidden side of life.”Moonlight is for lovers, but dark deeds are carried out by the silvery glow, as well. The term moonraker is from an old Wiltshire folk tale, about locals who were dredging a pond for kegs of smuggled alcohol. When confronted by the excise men, they played the dumb yokels and said they were trying to rake out the moon’s reflection in the water.\u0026nbspIf you are planning a robbery, then don’t do it on the third day of a new moon, or the enterprise will end in disaster, according to an old proverb. If you fall ill on the eighth day of a new moon, it’s likely death will follow. Should someone die at the time of a new moon, three more deaths are said to be on the horizon. And sleeping with the moon shining on your face will result in distortion of your features, or insanity.Ah, the moon and the mind. The insane were called called “lunatics” for a reason...\u0026nbsptheir state of mind was said to be directly influenced by the phases of the moon. The Lunacy Act of 1845 defined a lunatic as a person who exhibited lucidity in the first two phases of the moon but grew demented during the full moon phase. In 1940 a soldier, charged with murder, pleaded “moon madness” in mitigation in court.Lunacy, and the changes it wrought in humans, brings us back to the man who is pure of heart, and says his prayers by night, yet becomes a wolf. The ditty might have been penned by Curt Siodmak for The Wolf Man, but he was building on a dark tradition that has its roots in classical mythology.Zolar has little truck with the modern portrayal of lycanthropy, commenting somewhat huffily:\u0026nbsp“Just like vampires, the werewolf has been glorified by Hollywood and the motion pictures. For the ancients, a werewolf was a person transformed into a wolf by magical means. It is said that werewolves roamed the country at night and would attack babies and humans.”Murder case where man ‘thought victim was werewolf’ ends in mistrialThere are defences, of course, and ways to spot a werewolf in human form. They have flat fingers, so they used to say, and hair covering the palms of their\u0026nbsphands. And, of course, though werewolves were said to be immune to normal ordnance, a silver bullet, especially if blessed by a priest, would kill one. If that seems extreme –\u0026nbspfor example if the werewolf is a loved one –\u0026nbspsaying their Christian name three times would effect a transformation back into human form.It is said that the first man-to-wolf transformation was at the hands of Zeus, who was somewhat appalled that Lycaon of Arcadia\u0026nbspsacrificed his own child to the ruler of Olympus. Zeus turned Lycaon into a wolf for his crime, which is where we get the term lycanthrope from to denote a werewolf.According to John and Caitlin Matthews’\u0026nbspElement Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures, there was a wolf-cult built around Zeus after this, which survived until at least the first century AD. They write:\u0026nbsp“A member of the Antaeus family told Pliny the Elder that he had been a lycanthrope for nine years, having drawn lots with the rest of his clan to partake in these secret rites.”A werewolf could be created through being cursed, perhaps by a Hecate-worshipping witch, or sleeping in the light of the moon, or being conceived under a new moon. Or, as in the movies, from The Wolf Man to An American Werewolf in London (in which bluff rural Yorkshireman Brian Glover exhorts a couple of naive American tourists to “Beware the moon!”, to no avail), being bitten by another werewolf.Werewolf mania perhaps reached its height in 16th-century France, when dozens of people were tried and executed for being werewolves in a frenzy that spread across Europe, a full\u0026nbspcentury before the Salem witch trials in the United States.Michel Verdun is thought to be the first man to be tried for lycanthropy, in Poligny in 1521. Authorities investigating a wolf attack followed a trail of evidence and supposition that led them to Verdun’s home. He was arrested and under torture confessed to being a werewolf, pointing the finger at two other men, Pierre Bourgot and Philibert Montot.Bourgot told the authorities that he had been approached by three men dressed in black who urged him to reject God, and in return he was promised protection for his flock of sheep and given an ointment which, when applied, allowed him to transform into a wolf by the light of the moon. All three men were executed. Similar trials were carried out across Germany, the Netherlands and Estonia.We now know, of course, that the moon is not imbued with any magical powers, nor can exert any kind of influence over us. It is a lump of rock, about 2,000 miles in diameter.\u0026nbspIt is about\u0026nbsp4.5 billion years old, and is 250,000 miles away from the Earth. It has little atmosphere, and no weather no erosion means that the footprints left by the crew of Apollo 11 half a century ago will endure, untouched, for millions of years.And yet… the moon fascinates us beyond the fact of us actually getting there in 1969.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

He said it was “easy to over-interpret” the significance of quarterly membership numbers.By traditional measures of company performance Netflix is still growing fast. Price rises helped boost revenue by 26 per cent compared to the same quarter last year while profits exceeded expectations at £709m.Mihir Haria-Shah, head of broadcast at media planning agency Total Media said: “Netflix’s head start means it remains in reasonable health whilst the new services such as Disney Plus get over any early teething issues.\u0026nbsp“The bigger concern for Netflix is what happens further down the line once these new entrants have established themselves. It has essentially built its business on the back of leasing content from other companies and has had great success doing so.\u0026nbsp“Now its content providers are becoming competitors it will have to invest even more into original content as existing deals expire and content is taken off the platform.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anything that is hidden in such a way suggests that the person leaving it behind is most definitely aware that it is not the correct way to dispose of their rubbish.“You don’t actually see people just dropping litter these days, they all know better.\u0026nbspSome have suggested adding bins to the hills, but this does encourage folk\u0026nbspto empty their pockets, and leave even more behind.“Pistachio shells make a regular appearance on the Ben, as well as cigarette ends. All litter is bad, but has different impacts. Plastic will never go away, foodstuff\u0026nbspcan poison the wildlife, and tissuesfaeces spread bacteria.”First-time climbers\u0026nbspcan be the worst offenders, Mr Pyne said, likely through ignorance regarding how long organic material takes to break down in a mountain environment a banana skin may take between two and three years to disappear.However, following the Real3Peaks organised litter-picks and the long-term work of other volunteers, “the noticeable volume has gone down, and the place is looking much better for it”, he said.A more pressing problem is walkers going to the toilet because the desire for privacy leads them to pick the same spots over and over again, he said. “Most or all of the accessible and obvious hiding places\u0026nbspare open, unflushed toilets, smelling very bad, often draped in used tissues, a vibrant green algae present, and black coloured soil, which has been tainted by the concentrated urine.”Staying well away from water courses while doing one’s business is important, Mr Pyne said.He added: “The best thing that anyone outdoors can do, whether in the park, down by the canal, or in the mountains, is to pick up litter they see, and be considerate of where they will ‘go’.”The next Real3Peaks Challenge is due to take place on 12 October.Mountaineering Scotland runs a #TakItHame campaign designed to encourage walkers to pick up any litter they see.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I thought: ‘Oh my God they haven’t got a plan’.“That was really shocking frankly because the damage if you don\u0027t have a plan … it’s like Lance Corporal Jones you know, ‘Don’t panic, don’t panic’, running around like idiots.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

It’s not useful to use it.”However, Ms May\u0027s official spokesman later insisted: The Prime Minister was clear in her discussions in public or in private that the UK could leave without a deal.The European Commission’s top official\u0026nbspMartin Selmayr, meanwhile, said he thought the UK was still unprepared to leave without a deal.“We have seen what has been prepared on our side of the border for a hard Brexit. We don’t see the same level of preparation on the other side of the border.”The EU secretly offered to put Brexit “on ice” for five years in order to come up with a new deal for Europe, Ms May’s de facto deputy David Lidington told Panorama.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A group from the National Marine Mammal Foundation monitored the whales by boat.“We’re cautiously optimistic that the group dodged a bullet, and that they’re now on their way to deeper water,” said Clay George, a biologist for the Georgia Wildlife Resources Division.Crews had also flown a helicopter above the area, which is about 90 miles south of Savannah, and determined no other whales were stranded.Pilot whales are essentially large dolphins, and can grow to 24 feet in length and weigh 6,600 pounds.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Dr George said they were still investigating why the animals rushed to shore, an event he called “exceedingly rare in Georgia”.Dr George described the whales as “one to three-tonne dolphins”.“They’re so social that if one animal in the group gets injured or sick, all the other animals in the group can follow them great distances into shore,” he said, “and then they can strand.”Normally these creatures swim 100 miles offshore, he said, which means “something went wrong”, possibly days or weeks ago.In the necropsy, Dr George said researchers will be looking for ingested plastic, evidence of plastic netting or signs of an acoustic disturbance, like bombs or sonars, that could have caused one or more of the animals to swim towards land.“Tomorrow will be the beginning of a process that could go on for potentially weeks,” he said.Normally, added Dr George, he would not advise humans to intervene with pilot whales, but in this case, “it was the right thing to do”.Dr\u0026nbspErin Fougeres, who administers the marine mammal stranding program for the Fisheries ision of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Southeast, said that “mass strandings of pilot whales aren’t entirely uncommon for us.”There have been about 23 mass strandings in southeastern states since 1991, mostly along the Gulf of Mexico, but never in Georgia, she said.“This event, so far, and fingers crossed, has had the best possible outcome,” she said. “We don’t often have happy endings.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has threatened journalists, too, that they face prosecutionthey dare to publish the content of the cables.Trying to justy his threats, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner, Neil Basu, said he was sure the leaks had “damaged UK international relations” and on that basis no one publishing the leaks could plead a public interest defence.What a ludicrous over-reaction to what is really no more than a diplomatic spat over the Ferrero Rochers.Sure, it doesn’t exactly help UK US relations when our Ambassador calls the President of the United States “inept” and his administration “uniquely dysal”.But I would say it is mildly less damaging than some of the things that the Leader of Opposition, the Mayor of London and Scotland’s First Minister have said about Donald Trump. I can’t see Mr Basu dangling his handcuffs in front of them — and neither should he.Obviously, Sir Kim has reason to feel aggrieved that someone — presumably in the diplomatic service or the Foreign Office, because there is no evidence of computers being hacked — has leaked information he intended to be private. But it is a matter for the Government to investigate, not the police.How ridiculous Basu has said of the leaker: “You are now also responsible for erting busy detectives from under-taking their core mission.”No, Mr Basu — it is only thanks to your decision that officers have been taken off front-line duties to undertake this investigation.You could have told officials what police officers are forever telling the rest of us when we report our houses broken into or our bikes stolen: Sorry, but we’ve got too much  to do.It would be a dferent mattersomeone had leaked material that really did harm national security.The sort of information leaked by Kim Philby and his Soviet-sympathising accomplices in the s put British lives at risk.But leaking and publishing a diplomat’s private thoughts hardly comes into that category. Mr Basu’s attack on the principles of the free Press echoes Operation Elveden, the failed attempt by the Met to criminalise journalists who had obtained information from police officers, in some cases for money.The Met switched more than  police officers from other duties and arrested  people. The police probe cost taxpayers £.million and yet of  journalists charged, only one was convicted at trial — and that was quashed on appeal. Just one journalist, Dan Evans, pleaded guilty to an Elveden offence and was given a suspended sentence.The prosecutions relied on an ancient offence, Misconduct in Public Office, which was only ever supposed to apply to public servants, not journalists.As many lawyers, including the Lord Chief Justice, pointed out, it simply isn’t a criminal offence for someone to receive or to publish most forms of state information — only for a public official to sell it.There is a very good reason for this. Leaks, and the freedom to put their contents into the public domain, are an essential ingredient of our democracy. It is what helps the Press to keep in check corrupt or over-bearing politicians and public officials.Without the freedom to publish leaked information, for example, we would never have known the extent to which MPs and Lords were abusing their expenses regime.That required a newspaper to publish information gleaned from a computer disk which had been stolen — but thankfully in that case the Met decided that the public interest over-rode a possible offence of handling stolen goods.Without the Panama Papers we would never have known the extent to which wealthy iniduals and corporations have gone into keeping their wealth out of the taxman’s grasp. Without the “climategate” leaks we would not have known how some climate scientists were prepared to manipulate past temperature records to support their theories.It took a leak, too, to establish that the Blair government knew it was unlikely that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that George W Bush had resolved to overthrow Saddam regardless.Then there was “Plebgate”, when a leaked police log revealed a bust-up between government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and police manning the gates at Downing Street — and led an officer to be jailed when it was revealed he had invented his witness statement.There are, of course, plenty of other countries in the world where journalists would be locked up for publishing information that has leaked from the government, but they are not countries in which most of us would want to live.By over-reacting to what is an embarrassment to the Foreign Office, the Met has taken a leaf out of the book of President Erdogan of Turkey, who has locked up dozens of journalists as he attempts to suppress all opposition to his regime.Neil Basu and other senior Met Police officers should back off and accept that the Press is quite within its rights to publish leaked information that does not threaten national security.We are, after all, one of the world’s oldest ing democracies — not a tinpot state where people get led off in chains for daring to reveal the truth. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His English was fairly limited and my Spanish went no further than: “Paella, mucho gracias.”So when, after several minutes of discussing the musical inspiration for his new single album , I went in for the killer question.“How many women have you slept with ”He shrugged.“ ” I ventured.He pulled an expression to suggest I had woefully misjudged his pulling power with the opposite sex. So I aimed higher.“, ”“Ooo knows ” he drawled with a lazy smile. “A gentleman  . . .  he never tell.”“Shall we go with , then ” I suggested, aswe were making a joint entry to one of those “guess how many sweets” attractions at the local fete. He shrugged again, a gesture I took as implicit confirmation. Well, he didn’t deny it.The interview appeared the following day and shortly afterwards the figure went global when the US-based National Enquirer ran with it.Julio, who is charm personied, made no complaint when his legendary Lothario-ism went stratospheric, though many years later he mitigated to another interviewer who broached the subject: “Me, I don’t have numbers. I respect women very much.”Like Mick Jagger, who is said to have bedded around , women, the Spanish crooner joined the ranks of Warren Beatty, Errol Flynn, Jack Nicholson and the notorious lover Casanova as one of history’s great seducers.Back then, such, ahem, swordsmanship was admired. The majority of women swooned at the mere thought of a sacred moment in their seductive gaze, while young men felt both inspired and intimidated by such a dizzyingly high number of sexual conquests.But now  Thanks to the #metoo and #timesup campaigns, men with more notches on their bedposts than the rest of us have had hot dinners are regarded with certain distaste. Last week, Julio’s tongue-in-cheek statistic popped up again, when a -year-old man finally won recognition as the star’s son — the product of a brief affair in the s.Suddenly, the legendary “,” was being viewed through the modern-day, more puritanical prism, where such behaviour might be regarded as “sex addiction”.Whatever the truth , he’s now been with we Miranda Rijnsburger for more than  years and they have five children.So it’s fair to say that his womanising days are long gone. Just as well, perhaps. Because,the Love Island men are anything to go by, old roues are now old hat and it’s romantic and wholly faithful young men like Tommy Fury who, quite rightly, earn the nation’s admiration. Long may it go on.Though it seems there are still some lotharios refusing to go quietly. Last year, Italian playboy Maurizio Zanfanti,  — dubbed the “Romeo of Rimini” after claiming to have slept with , women — died while having sex with a -year-old tourist in his car. It’s what he would have wanted.JOBLESS Daniel Eyers and his pregnant partner Lucrezia Worrell say they have been evicted from their Kent council house for spending their rent money on takeaways.The couple, who have four children, are now living with Daniel’s mum. Daniel, , says: “I can’t get a job as it would mean my children would miss out on school, as I have to drive them there every day.”Oh let me count the ways.A flexible, part-time job perhaps  How about your partner taking them to school, or asking other parents for a lt  Or perhaps desisting from having a fth childyou can’t afford to keep the other four Meanwhile, let us compare and contrast this “can’t do” attitude with that of this father in Vietnam who drags his son across a raging, muddy river in a plastic bag so he can get to school, before ing to his remote village to work.A couple of years ago, we cowered inside a friend’s French holiday home as hailstones the size of golf balls rained down outside.Oh how we laughed . . . until I remembered our hire car parked outside.It was peppered with more dents than a Swiss cheese and, because we hadn’t taken out the “full insurance”, left us with a bill that cost more than the actual holiday.A BRIEF chat in front of the assembled cameras at Wimbledon was all it took for the Duchesses of Cambridgeand Sussexto dispel the long-standing rumours of a spat.Several weeks ago, it was also reported that the Duchess of Cambridge had fallen out with Rose Hanbury, one of her closest friends in the “Norfolk set”.The story has been dismissed as “unsubstantiated rumours” by sources within the Palace but it flared up again when Rose attended the recent Trump banquet without her husbandand was seated in practically a separate postcode to her old chum. Of course, they could kill those rumours stone dead too by being photographed together while out shopping or having lunch.That it hasn’t happened perhaps speaks volumes.AMAL CLOONEY is a well-regarded human rights lawyer who, together with husband George, uses her  to highlight ious liberal causes.So I was rather perplexed to hear – via a -page leaked document – that in  she reportedly gave legal advice to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on how to potentially sabotage the British government’s bid to arrest him.Whether you think Assange’s role in leaking , classied US documents was espionage or heroism, it remains that he was also trying to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faced charges of sexual assault.How, pray tell, does that fit in with liberal values JENNIFER Lopez is  later this month and credits her youthfulness to daily “self-affirmations”.“I tell myself ‘I am youthful and timeless’ every day a few times a day,” she says. It sounds like cliched bull****, but it’s not. Age is all in your mind.”Hmmm. Quite frankly, I could chant her mantra on a loop and never look like this.One suspects that regular exercise, healthy eating and an expensive skincare regime have played their part too.A SMALL number of residents currently living in the swanky London area of Hampstead are up in arms at proposed boundary changes that would place their homes in nearby Gospel Oak.“By severing political ties, you’re disenfranchising many residents,” says one.What they actually mean is: The price of our houses will plummet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, her child had passed away more than a month previously.Defence counsel Martin Bernhaut said his client knew what she had done was wrong.“Ms Mains accepts that she received a range of payments relating to deceased child during a period when she was not entitled to.“She absolutely accepts that and she did make  representations to Centrelink that her child was alive and in her care and had ious disabilities that required additional care.”However, her solicitor added, the Judge should take into account that her daughter, “died in horric, tragic, circumstances aged five months”.The trauma of this together with her inability to read and write meant she was “never going to be able to work due to her range of conditions.”He noted that at one point her distress over her child dying was so strong that she began “dressing up a doll and pretending it was her daughter”.Mr Bernhaut said her “limited cognitive ability” meant she had been entitled to a range of other welfare payments which she didn’t claim.Ms Mains’ lawyer argued she potentially could have received around £, of Newstart allowance during the same period or nearly £, in disability support.The possible — but never claimed for — disability support payments would have added up to just £, less than she obtained for the care of her dead daughter.Ms Mains had a range of issues that included alcohol abuse and had spent several months in a residential hospital program to detox which her counsel asked to be taken into account in terms of sentencing.Mr Bernhaut said his client had already paid back around , of the funds.The sentencing was adjourned until  September.Similar offenses have happened in this country, including Karen Trant, , from Devon claimed she couldnt leave the house as she was an agoraphobic but snuck off to live in Goa for large parts of the year.She claimed £, in disability benefits, income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit.Ruth Nabaguzzi,  from Forest Gate in London cheated the taxpayer of an estimated £million using   identities.Pensioner Ian Burns, , from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire swindled nearly £,, pretending to be three other people."},{"url":null,"title":"butlins 50s 60s vintage photos","story":"A stunning collection of pictures of packed out Butlins holidays camps from the s and s have been unearthed.Holidaymakers can be seen packing out the pools, playing games in the clubhouse and whizzing around on four-wheel bikes.Ultra glamorous s pin-ups in their bikinis are pictured posing on ing boards and mucking around in a fountain.The images, which were recently discovered in TopFoto’s digital archives, show Butlins glory days when the camps soared in popularity.The firms original owner Billy Butlin wanted to make the British seaside break accessible to all, creating a place of colour and happiness where entertainment would be provided so that families could really enjoy their time together.Butlins started at a camp in Skegness in , followed by Clacton-on-Sea in .During World War Two the parks in Filey, Ayr, and Pwllheli were handed over to the government to help the war effort.Bognor Regis , Mineheadand Barry Islandopened next.The s saw foreign holidays become increasingly affordable and British staycations lost their allure.The Butlin family sold the business to the Rank Organisation in  for £million, before it was bought by Bourne Leisure in .Today the company is investing heavily in its three remaining sites in Skegness, Bognor and Minehead."},{"url":null,"title":"stunning bird photos eagle dragging fox cub","story":"The stunning image shows the fox being lted into the air by its winged nemesis as both refuse to let go of their prey.The image was taken in the US and the photographer says the heartstopping scene ended with the eagle eventually dropping the fox and flying away with the rabbit.He added that the fox escaped unharmed - although the rabbit wasnt so fortunate.The pic was named among one of the best bird photography pics of .The stunning series of photos reveals the majesty of wild birds entered into this year’s National Audobon Society photography contest, the rest of which can be seen below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Crafty George Osborne, who was Chancellor  when a deal was stitched up, believed forcing the BBC to fund the leline would save the Government £million a year from . But the Treasury’s own watchdog yesterday revealed the move could backfire - ultimately costing more than it saves. The Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed spending on Pension Credit was set to rise because of the move to restrict free licences to only those who receive the benefit. Many who are eligible but do not currently take up the benefit are now likely to do so amid a planned advertising blitz by the BBC to raise awareness of entitlement, the OBR said.    The Department for Work and Pensions should be braced for a surge in demand for Pension Credit, it suggests. OBR chairman Robert Chote said it “illustrates the dangers of unintended consequences when governments come up with clever ways to save money”. Its fiscal risks report says: “DWP estimates there were around , people aged  or over who were entitled to the guarantee element of pension credit in - but who did not receive it, almost  per cent of the total number entitled. “These had an average entitlement of £ a week, resulting in around £.billion of unclaimed benefit among this age group. So around half of that group would need to start claiming to wipe out the expected savings from transferring responsibility to the BBC and the BBC cutting its domestic spending by a corresponding amount.”    While “very large increases in take-up are unlikely”, the Corporation’s plan to publicise the availability of Pension Credit will lead to more people taking it up. It adds: “It is relatively unusual for a government to delegate parameters of welfare policy to a broadcasting company in an attempt to save money, and it is perhaps not surprising that this may have unintended consequences. “The BBC’s decision to means-test free TV licences via a link to pension credit receipt may well raise welfare spending by more than it reduces BBC spending ... The net effect on the public finances would therefore be to push the budget deficit up not down.” Stressing the move posed a fresh risk to public coffers, the OBR goes on: “The likely cost of the BBC’s recent decision to means-test free TV licences for the over-s by linking it to pension credit – thereby potentially prompting a material number of those currently not taking it up to do so – poses a fiscal risk that we had not previously envisaged.

I was born in Iran and came over at the age of five with my mum, so people also see it as poetic justice for Nazanin.”    Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe is the imprisoned British Iranian mother further endangered by Boris when he was Foreign Secretary. “The buffoon character has consequences,” Ali says. “Nazanin is one of the consequences.” Johnson was parachuted into Uxbridge as the Tory candidate in , after leaving office as mayor. The  election saw his majority halved, partly due to shting ­demographics, and partly, claims Ali, due to his lack of time spent in the area. “It’s so rare to get Boris here in the constituency that you need David Attenborough to narrate it,” Ali says dryly. “You could drop him off at the end of the road and he wouldn’t be able to find Uxbridge station.” Then there’s the thorny local issue of Heathrow expansion. “Boris was going to lie down in front of the bulldozers but he ran away to Afghanistan instead,” Ali says. “I’m a Heathrow councillor. There are villages that will be devastated by Heathrow expansion in my ward. I’ll stand up for them.”    The contrast between the two men could hardly be wider. Ali grew up in a working-class household where his mum often had to choose between feeding the gas or electricity meter. “Even in my wildest dreams I never thought I would stand to be an MP,” he says. “Becoming an MP doesn’t happen for people like me who grow up in a council house raised by a single mum. MPs are people like Boris – Etonians.”Instead, the Manchester United fan dreamed of becoming a goalkeeper, only losing out on a place at Fulham academy when genetic testing showed he wasn’t going to be tall enough.He pulls himself up to his ft in height. “Science was right,” he smiles.” Ali joined the Labour Party when he was at Brunel University, after hearing alumni and Shadow ­Chancellor John McDonnell speak. “My generation has been hit with everything – tuition fees tripled, we’d lost EMA, the maintenance grant was gone. My mum was made homeless from her council house. “I decided to get politically active and I went to a meeting. I thought I’d give him hell. But by the end of the meeting I said to him, ‘I want to canvas for you’. That broke the barrier in my mind against joining a political party.” The former vice president of the National Union of Students laughs and says a few MPs have advised him to “get a real job” before becoming an MP.    “I don’t need to work in Goldman Sachs for some le experience,” he says. “Real le experience is when your mum can’t afford the electricity to cook. It’s spending my first day at school terried because I couldn’t speak English. It’s considering picking up a kne to protect yourself, which luckily I never did.” In any case, Ali says he’s lost several job offers since announcing his candidacy. “They were with organisations who need to get on with the new prime minister, I understand that.” He’s also had death threats since standing.He shows me a message on Twitter about his candidacy: “I hope your family are well protectedyou do this”.Ali shrugs. “I went to a school in North West London where you left by dferent entrances depending on what gang you were in. I had knives pulled on me regularly. I got beaten up. This has happened all my adult le. So I’m not that bothered.” Boris, he says, “is going the Trump route. The veneer’s slipping. The ­dference between Trump and ­traditional Republicans isn’t policy, it’s that language has dropped the veneer. We need to give our own simple answer that the people with black and brown skin living next door have more in common with you than someone who made £million tanking the economy.“Words have consequences. I was at a primary school to give a talk. When they saw me, a kid said ‘ Brexit means Brexit’."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands more people could dwp","story":"NewsThousands more people could get DWP disabled benefits after Supreme Court caseTodays ruling - the first ever on PIP in the Supreme Court - is a \"landmark moment\" for thousands of people with mental health issuesShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUL NewsA charity celebrated a landmark moment in todays ruling\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands more people with mental health conditions could qualy for benefits after a Supreme Court case. A charity celebrated a landmark moment in todayaposs ruling - the first ever to involve Personal Independence Paymentin the UKaposs highest court. Technically the government won on a limited point in the case, brought by a -year-old man known as aposMMapos. But five judges, led by Supreme Court President Lady Hale, also said benefit chiefs should interpret a key rule on qualying for PIP more broadly than they currently do. Mind said this detail of the ruling is crucial, and could help thousands of people who struggle in social situations.  MM was rejected for PIP because assessors said he didnapost need social support to engage with other people. Instead assessors said he only needed prompting to engage with people - a definition that carries fewer points under the scoring system for PIP. The Department for Work and Pensionsdefended the decision on two counts. First, the DWP said social support meant someone trained and experienced in assisting people - not just a friend.And secondly, the DWP said the supporter has to bepresent at the timesomeone is trying to engage socially.But the five Supreme Court judges said this second part of the definition was too narrow.    They wrote: Social support is likely to take many dferent forms, depending on the inidual needs of the claimant,. It is undesirable to attempt to prescribe, in the abstract, which other forms of support will be sufficient. It will be a question of fact and degree, and is something that will have to be worked out on a case by case basis. Mind spokeswoman Sophie Corlett said: This is a landmark moment in the ongoing battle to make sure disabled people are supported through our benefits system to live well. Far too many are struggling to claim benefits they need because of draconian assessments, which often fail to take fully into account the impact a mental health problem can have. Mind hopes, that, with this ruling, thousands more will be able to benefit from much needed help. We are very proud to have intervened in support of the inidual who took this case on behalf of thousands of people with mental health problems.” "},{"url":null,"title":"age gap lesbian lovers marry","story":"NewsAge gap lesbian lovers marry despite being mistaken for grandma and grandchildJulia, , is  years younger than her we, Eileen, , but both say their sex le is incredible and that they just ignore the abuse they get from trollsShareCommentsByJane LavenderAssistant Editor:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video age-gap-lesbian-lovers-marry-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA lesbian couple with a  year age gap have tied the knot - despite being mistaken for grandmother an granddaughter. Julia Zelg-De Freest, a -year-old YouTuber and singer met political correspondent Eileen Zelg-De Freest, age , on Tinder less than a year ago. They say it was love at first sight and they have been inseperable ever since. Julia said: “When I saw Eileen in person for the first time, I was just in awe of her because she is just the most gentle and lovely person ever.” But the couple have received hateful comments from trolls.    Julia said: “I think we get hate comments mostly because of the age-gap but also because we are gay and there are still a lot of homophobic people out there.” Despite their almost -year gap, the pair have learnt to not let the judgement from others bother them and their romance. And while Julia was singing at a gig in London, she proposed to Eileen. Eileen ed the question when the pair on holiday in Brazil meeting Juliaaposs mum, who is eight years younger than her new we. The couple, who live in London, have said they have received nothing but support from both their families.    The pair flew to Julia’s home country Brazil where they met Julia’s mother for the first time in December last year. Their genuine love won over family and friends and the couple decided to take the next big step – a le-long commitment to each other. The wedding ceremony took place at a -star hotel in Liverpool Street, in London on June . Julia wore an A-line white Maggie Sottero dress with Eileen also donning an elegant white, lace dress. Both brides wore a veil and dyed their hair bright pink.    Julia and Eileen were both in tears saying their vows during an emotional wedding ceremony. The brides weren’t the only ones who couldn’t hold back the tears. Wedding guests were also moved as the happy couple were pronounced as we and we. Before their wedding ceremony, Julia said: “My mom and my auntie and my best friend came from Brazil, I have an aunt that came from Germany as well and Eileen has some family and friends who are coming from America. “So we are super happy that quite a few people came from dferent countries for our wedding. We are very, very grateful they’re here.” Both Julia and Eileen couldn’t hide their excitement before the ceremony.    Julia said: “I know that she’s the one and she feels the same as well, it’s really wonderful. Eileen added: “Getting married is a big process. “It’s a really big business that you could almost lose sight of the thing you’re actually going to do. “And it’s really a very intense feeling so I ordered champagne.” Speaking of how she was feeling before the ceremony, Eileen said: “Really, really nervous and excited. I haven’t felt nervous like this in quite a while.”    Eileen admitted that she never thought of getting married. She said: “I think part of the reason for that is because I grew up in a time where for gay people it was never something that you even had the right to think about.” Eileen’s sister-in-law, Nancy De Freest, said: “The last thing I expected was Eileen to be married but I am so happy for her that she has finally found some happiness in her le.” She said that the age dference between Eileen and Julia at first came as a shock but added: “The age somewhat surprised me but knowing Eileen, she loves fun and she loves le. “When she told me about Julia it just seemed like that would be the perfect person for Eileen.”  Julia’s friend, Lara Sant ’Anna, who flew from Brazil to attend her friend’s wedding ceremony, said that Julia is quite a spontaneous person and added: “It’s not a surprise they are getting married so soon. “They love each other. So itaposs okay.” Celebrating the beginning of their new le together as we and we, the newly-wed couple said that the age gap has never been an issue. Eileen told said: “This is the end point, this is what love does...” Julia added: “Love is love. “We have as much right as everybody  to be happy, to get married and to celebrate our love.” "},{"url":null,"title":"building owners grenfell cladding must","story":"NewsBuilding owners with \"Grenfell\" cladding must take immediate action to fix itLong-awaited government fire tests have confirmed HPL cladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower is lethal and must be fixed “as soon as possible”ShareCommentsByMatthew Young:,  JUL News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower is lethal and must be fixed “as soon as possible”, government fire tests have found. Long-awaited tests carried out on High Pressure Laminatematerial - which is wrapped around the homes of thousands of people in the UK - found it was “clear” in some cases it had to be removed. HPL cladding was deemed unsafe when it was not made with fire retardant or is used alongside a combustible material. The Fire Brigades Union said it was “outrageous” it had taken the Government so long to recognise the dangers, more than two years after the tragedy that killed  in West London. Part of the Mirror’s Grenfell: Never Again campaign is to see the removal of dangerous cladding from UK buildings.    The Fire Protection Association , which carried out the test, said last week that all combustible cladding should be removed from high-rise buildings regardless of the insulation used. In May the Government announced a £ million fund to help with the removal of lethal ACM cladding - which was used on Grenfell - on buildings across the country. But many leaseholders whose buildings have HPL and other dangerous cladding are being forced to foot le-changing bills by developers. Although experts have been calling for tests on non-ACM cladding since September , it was only carried out last Thursday. An expert  for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government found it was “clear” that an external wall fitted with non-fire-retardant HPL cladding “would not have met the al requirements of the Building Regulations”.    It “presents a notable fire hazard on buildings over m,” the government told building owners in an advice note. Building owners who identy these materials “should take immediate measures to remediate their system,” it said. The note added: “Where existing buildings have any HPL  in combination with combustible insulation, they should immediately take action.” Fire retardant HPL was safe when used in combination with a non-combustible material, the experts found. Sarah Jones MP, Labour’s Shadow Housing Minister, blasted: “In the wake of a damning select committee report, the government has finally confirmed what experts have been telling them for years: HPL cladding is lethal and should be removed from buildings. “The fact that ministers waited until two years after Grenfell to confirm to people that they have been living in potential death traps is a disgrace.  “And today’s statement is a poor attempt at a cover-up, highlighting the one combination of cladding and insulation which passed a fire test.  “Worst of all, Ministers were made aware of a failed fire test featuring HPL nine months ago and failed to act. “The Government must immediately require building owners to check for this cladding, as they did with ACM, so we know the scale of this problem.

In her former le as a TV actress, thereaposs a good chance Meghan would have responded to the rumours personally, possibly by posting a comment on social media or her popular blog The Tig. But sheaposs not allowed to do this in her new royal role, and itaposs largely because of her husband Prince Harryaposs great-grandmother.    According to royal expert Victoria Arbiter, the Queen Motheraposs “well-worn mantra” could be causing Meghan a few problems. Speaking to Nine News Australia, she said: “I think really she [Meghan] is doing incredibly well. “It’s very dficult when you come from a celebrity background where a publicist can stand up for you or come out and say ‘no, that report is categorically untrue.’ “But, generally speaking, members of the public follow the Queen Mother’s well-worn mantra: ‘Never complain, never explain.’ “And so you have to sit back while the world’s media and social media just comment. Even though Meghan hasnapost been able to speak out, many of her friends have defended her in a series of TV and magazine interviews.   When the Queen Mother died back in , she left Harry a lot more money than his brother Prince William in her will.But it wasnapost because she preferred the younger brother, and there was actually a very thoughtful reason behind it. Years before she died, the Queen Mother reportedly put a large chunk of her money into a trust fund for all her great grandchildren.Harry and William shared about £m of this, with the bulk going to Harry, reports the BBC .When the Queen dies and Prince Charles becomes king, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, will become the new Prince of Wales.    This means he will take on the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate which funds the public, charitable and private activities of the heir to the throne.Prince Harry on the other hand, wonapost get any of this.After her death, Buckingham Palace released an outline of the Queen Motheraposs will, after going through the high court to try and keep it private. Her estate, which was valued at between £m and £m at the time, was passed onto her daughter the Queen. Her majesty did not have to pay inheritance on the fortune. Many items from the Queenaposs private art collection were given to the royal collection and went on display at the Palace.    Prince Charles moved into her home Clarence House. A statement released at the time read: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother has bequeathed her entire estateto The Queen. In her will, she asked The Queen to make certain bequests to members of her staff, and these bequests will be subject to Inheritance Tax in the normal way.

The coupleaposs builders planned to do further extensive work in the garden of Frogmore Cottage .But the Duke and Duchess of Sussex changed their mind about the design of the garden after they were granted planning permission by their local council. Newly released documents show that the couple are now seeking retrospective planning consent for external landscaping works’’ after opting for a dferent design. They could be forced to reverse the work at their padplanning consent is refused.      The royal couple moved into the Grade II listed Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate in April ahead of the birth of their first child Archie. The cottage received an extensive £. million renovation funded by £.m from the taxpayer and £, from themselves, according to sources. The cottage was gted to the Duke and Duchess by the Queen last year, with Kensington Palace confirming the move in November, saying Windsor was a very special place for the couple. Frogmore Cottage is located near of Windsor Castle, the Queenaposs summer residence, and St Georgeaposs Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Ian Ratclfe, project manager at the Royal Household said in an email to the council’s planning enforcement team: “This application has been submitted following a material change to elements to the granting of planning consent.” Under planning law, a retrospective planning application is submitted to the councila change is made to a property that requires planning permission and approval has not been sought.    A local authority can also request that a retrospective planning application is submitted for the work that has already carried out. However, it does not mean that planning permission will automatically be granted and the application will be treated in the usual way. If the retrospective application is refused, the local authority can issue an enforcement notice which could require the couple to reverse any changes made to Frogmore Cottage. Under the plans revealed by a well-placed royal source last month, the plans include provision for a tennis or badminton court at the coupleaposs Windsor home. There are also said to be plans for exterior painting and landscaping, the installation of security lights and the planting of £,-worth of fast-growing shrubs and trees.  Several baby friendly features for the couple’s child Archie as well as a vegetable garden so the couple can grow their own produce are also included. The revised plans, according to the source, will be slightly dferent following a last-minute change of heart by the royal couple. A well-placed source said: “Some changes have been made to the plans to create the Duke and Duchess’s garden after the original planning consent was granted. “Frogmore Cottage will be the perfect place for a royal prince to grow up with the Duke and Duchess and these changes are very important to create a perfect home for themselves and Archie. “These specic changes are currently being dealt with the local council to avoid the need for any action.

Juan Cerdas said it is one of his “hobbies” to feed and kiss the creatures for tourists on the ‘crocodile river tour’ that sails the Tarcoles River. The river, in the province of Puntarenas, has one of the highest crocodile populations in the world. Many of them are American crocodiles, who are typically found in Florida and are one of the only species that can walk on four legs. They can grow up to  feet long and weigh hundreds of pounds.    But Juan said they are “not as aggressive as they would have us believe”. The river has become a huge tourist attraction in recent years. Tourists flock there to visit a bridge over the Tárcoles River which has become known as “puente de cocodrilo,” or “crocodile bridge.” Underneath it crocodiles sunbathe in the afternoon sun.   Meanwhile the Mirror recently reported on horric scenes of animal cruelty as hundreds of  crocodiles  have been beaten to  death  by a mob of angry villagers after a local was apparently eaten by one of the reptiles.The crocodiles were living in a lake in a property owned by businessman Sorong Regency in West Papau, Indonesia, and were blamed for the death of a villager on Friday.The angry locals stormed his property to take their cruel revenge on the  animals  on Saturday.A video shows the bloodthirsty mob dragging two-metre long crocodiles from the water before beating them to death with picks and other tools.And here are our top  hints on how to survive a crocodile or alligator attack, including: . Stay away from water with crocodiles or alligators in.             Ask local residents about where crocodiles or alligators live in lakes and rivers, and donapost go swimming outside of designated areas. Do not go in murky water, or swim at dusk or at night, when the animals hunt and are harder to see..   Be aware of your surroundings.If youaposre going to be in or around water where they live, you must remain on your guard. Alligators and crocodiles can hide themselves very well in water, often keeping only their eyes and nostrils above water or submerging entirely. Do not dangle arms or legs off a boat into the water, donapost walk too close to rivers or lakes, and avoid thick vegetation that provides these animals with good cover..   Stay at least fteen feet away from alligators or crocodiles.Once youaposve spotted them, give crocodilians a wide berth.  Fteen feet is usually ample on land, but during mating season, or when near babies, itaposs a good idea to stay even farther away. Crocodilians are surprisingly fast - especially in water - so stay as far away as possible.

Matheson urging him to put the brakes on a consultation into the project to dual the A between Huntly and Aberdeen.He has also made repeated calls for transport bosses to reconsider ruling out dualling the road along its existing route.Mr Macdonald said: “At a recent meeting in Inverurie, representatives from the local A Action Group were able to put forward their case for putting the option back on the table to representatives from Transport Scotland and Amey Arup.“Neither Transport Scotland nor Amey Arup have yet been able to provide a clear explanation of why this option was deselected so early and failed during the meeting to answer the Action Group’s compelling arguments.“I have now written to Michael Matheson making this clear, and urging him to bring a halt to the consultation so it can be reopened with Online Inverurie as an option, which the public can be invited to comment on.”Transport Scotland has faced repeated calls to justy why dualling the existing A Aberdeen to Inverness road at Inverurie has not been included in proposals to widen the route.Campaigners have claimed the option has been “rejected prematurely” on “flawed and incomplete” information.However, Mr Matheson previously claimed the dropped option would result in the loss of some properties and gardens of residents along the existing route.But Mr Macdonald said the option would only have an impact on neighbouring propertiesthey built the road to a higher standard than the AWPR – meaning it would be a wider road.He added: “If you dual the existing route at the current standard then you don’t have the impact on properties.”A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “Re-use of the existing route between East of Huntly and Aberdeen has been investigated thoroughly as part of the design and assessment process.“Due to a number of factors, such as the existing trunk road alignment and the impact on existing roadside properties, as well as the high number of junctions and accesses, the assessment concluded it would be more suitable to develop the new dual carriageway offline from the existing trunk road at Inverurie, with the existing A retained for use as part of the local road network.“However, some of the options under consideration do include sections of online upgrade on other parts of the route where this is feasible.“The consultation is now closed and all feedback received is vital and will be taken into consideration as we look to identy a preferred option for the scheme later this year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column

Things have gone a little quiet since then as consultation begins, so let us hope his officials keep his promise to the people of Argyll.Jim Jepson and Inveraray Legion deserve great credit for organising this week#s activities in commemoration of D-Day and the training carried out around Loch Fyne.It is all too easy for these important parts of our history to be forgotten and their signicance ignored, but the work of Jim # as a former curator at the Combined Operations museum and a recognised expert on the subject # has ensured that the memory keeps burning."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 14 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBike scrambling fans out there of a certain age will be feeling nostalgic at the prospect of ato a track described as #one of the best in the world# later this month.Kilmartin is famous in the motocross world and mouths are watering at the prospect.Not that long ago,you had walked into a shop and asked for a bottle of water you would be offered fizzy French stuff or perhaps tonic or soda water.Plain drinking water  We had taps for that.A multi-million pound industry has #sprung# up, selling water to us in plastic bottles.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

So wersquore also proposing a new neonatal leave and pay entitlement to make this time a bit easier for parents whose babies need to spend a prolonged period in neonatal care.The consultation will also consider whether firms should publish their leave, pay and flexible working policies and whether there should be a requirement to consider advertising jobs as ldquoflexible.Mrs May discussed the proposals with parents during a visit to Wimbledon in south-west London.Small business owner Philippa Harris, mother of two-year-old Toby, said she and her husband had been ldquovery lucky as ldquohis organisation fully supported shared parental leave so we took three months each.She told the PA news agency:ldquoI run a small business, so it was really important that I got back to work quite quickly to minimise impact.ldquoI took three months, he took the other three months, that allowed us to have the full six months with Toby at home.She said that the group of parents and Mrs May discussed the proposals for firms to be more open about their parental leave policies.ldquoAsking about the leave almost implies that yoursquore about to take six months to a year off, we really need to be much more open and flexible working is such a big thing, we felt as a group that should really enable change, Mrs Harris said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May launches consultation on shake-up of parental leave system"},{"url":null,"title":"blustery conditions as bowls greens officially open","story":"At Campbeltown Bowling Club on Saturday afternoon, president Bobby Dalziel welcomed a good crowd of players who were willing to endure the cold conditions before his we Lorraine sent the first jack straight down the Stronvaar green.She was presented with a bouquet of flowers by vice president David Brown#s two-year-old daughter, Olivia.Across town at Argyll Bowling Club, president Kenny Kerr welcomed members and wished them success for the new season, after which there was a minute#s silence in memory of those members no longer with us.The president#s we, Alison Kerr, rolled the first jack of the season and was presented with flowers by her granddaughter, Charlotte.Players enjoyed the first game of the new season, with the blustery conditions providing an added challenge.The green played well thanks to the hard work of greenkeeper Bobby Mathieson.The presidents were the winners by a narrow margin over the vice presidents.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

You could call it cowardice, the reluctance to see the player I wanted to win, but suspected would not, brought low. Such was the fight Federer put up, however, that by the fourth set I had rediscovered my nerve, and was back on the sofa, strapped in safely to prevent me hitting the ceiling whenever he won a rally.When Djokovic finally prevailed, the cameras politely kept off Federer for a few moments. Not that it would have made much dference. Unlike the French player who had sobbed uncontrollably after conceding the menrsquos doubles final, the Swiss maestro is made of sterner stuff. Of course being worsted must have been hard. The ferocity of the game spoke to how much each player wanted to win. As the football pundits like to say, this pair left nothing in the changing room, throwing their hearts and souls into combat, and playing through a level of exhaustion only marathon runners can fully comprehend.In a previous age, a duel of this signicance would have resulted in one contestant being carried, mortally wounded, off the field. From that perspective, Federerrsquos defeat ndash a silver salver and a substantial cheque ndash is still victory of a sort. In a gracious speech, he acknowledged Djokovicrsquos brilliance. The new Wimbledon champion was equally sporting, talking of the inspiration he took from Federer, not just for playing so well at , but throughout his remarkable career.Whatever encouragement thirty-something athletes take from the Swissrsquos astonishing performance, there is inspiration also in his acceptance of the result.

Since statistically we are likely to fall short more often than we win, we should be given guidance in how to cope.

He did not want an open-top bus parade when the team ed home after coming fourth in the World Cup. That, he said, would be to celebrate failure. He now wants the team to focus on learning how to win. Hersquos absolutely right, yet one hopes that this process will include a dose of realism, a cushioning of expectations, that allows for coming up short without a crisis of self-belief or losing face.Federerrsquos reactions after the final were a lesson in precisely that. He acknowledged that he and Djokovic had both had their chances to win, and he had blown his.

Mr Hunt thought it was not helpful to use that kind of language about the US President. In other words, donrsquot say what you see. Wrap your measured, liberal response in pretty paper and tie it up with a silky ribbon. That will show him.: Why Iain Macwhirter is lookingforward to a Johnson premiershipThe House of Representatives did the necessary, prompting the President to double down by declaring he did not have a racist bone in his body. If only an X-ray could pick up such things. Even then there would be some running shy of the diagnosis. It was left to George Conway, husband of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway no less, to say it like he saw it. In a piece for the Washington Post, Mr Conway, a lawyer, wrote that he had thought the President boorish, dim-witted, inarticulate, incoherent, narcissistic and insensitive. ldquoNo matter how much I found him ultimately unfit, he added, ldquoI still gave him the benefit of the doubt about being a racist. But Sunday left no doubt. Naivete, resentment and outright racism, roiled in a toxic mix, have given us a racist president. I think we have a winner in this particular round of Catchphrase.Mr Trumprsquos aim is as brutally simple as it is ugly: make the  election about race, because it worked in . As for the aftermath, a country even more ided than it currently is, donrsquot worry about that for now,you ever do. This is not a clever political strategy but a failure of leadership on a breathtaking scale.Failure of leadership is not confined to Republican presidents. Inyesterday,  Labour peers laid the same charge at Jeremy Corbynrsquos door for his negligence in tackling anti-Semitism within the party.ldquoYou have failed to defend our partyrsquos anti-racist values, said the advertisement paid for by the peers. ldquoYou have therefore failed the test of leadership. Quite the eyebrow scorcher. No wonder Theresa May brandished it at the Labour leader during PMQs yesterday.: Suspension of parliament being consideredIt was notable that the signatories to the letter mentioned the Panorama whistleblowers, the former party staff who defied non-disclosure agreements to speak out. Almost all of them were young and at the beginning of their careers. They were risking a lot, and the strain of dealing with so much hate, and seeing accusations filed away with zero action taken, took its toll. Several found their mental health suffering. One contemplated suicide.It was left to these youngsters, as it was left to the four congresswomen in the US, to make a stand against, and to suffer the consequences of, other peoplersquos failure to lead. The older, the wiser, the more experienced and powerful, might come along in time, but they could not be counted on.Accepted wisdom has it that we are living in the era of the populist strongmen. The Trump, the Orban, the Putin, the Duterte. How did it happen  Because as societies we were seduced by the notion of simplicity. Le was busy and stressful, the political problems we faced were complex and seemingly intractable, the pace of change was unrelenting. Along came people who said they had the answers. Who said donrsquot listen to those so-called ldquoexperts who tell you things cannot be done. Who promised to sort things out because it was all very simple, really.: Easier to believe lie than seek truthThe phenomenon was not the sole preserve of the seemingly strong, or men. It was Theresa May, after all, who coined the phrase ldquoBrexit means Brexit and look at the chaos she unleashed. Nor is it only to be seen on the right. Mr Corbyn, or rather his closest aides, operate like a collective strongman, treating any criticism as an attack that must be crushed.There are indeed answers to societyrsquos ills, and at heart we know what they are. Homelessness  Build more houses, and tackle the deep rooted problems that brought the person to sleep on the streets. Itrsquoll cost you, and it wonrsquot be easy. End child poverty  Not cheap, and it will take time. No NHS waiting lists  Open your purse and expect a wait. Save the planet  Extremely expensive, as well as a pain in the backside. So much easier to believe in the simple answer or turn the other way.One would like to think the pendulum was about to swing back, as people began to see that this drive for simplicity was exacting its own price, whether it be in ever widening inequality or worsening social stre. But then this time next week, barring an upset, we will witness Boris Johnson becoming PM. Mr Johnson is a king among Simple Simons. This is a man whose answers to problems are so snappy they can fit on the side of a bus. A man who oozes laziness, who reeks of the quick fix that turns out to be the bodge job, who changes his position to please whoever he is speaking to at the time.The irony is that far from being strong, what all these leaders have in common is their weakness, and that will begin to show itself when their fortunes change.

He says \"responsibility for this tragic outcome rests squarely with the hostage takers\".Two days later David Cameron, the then prime minister confirms that Ms Norgrove may have died as a result of so-called \"friendly fire\", and launched a full inquiry.US commander General David Petraeus had informed Downing Street that a review of the rescue operation had uncovered new information suggesting that a grenade detonated by task force members may have been to blame.An investigation jointly carried out by the UK and US, later concluded she had died of injuries sustained from a grenade thrown by a US soldier during the ill-fated mission."},{"url":null,"title":"bird-tweets-helping-scientists-track-species-move","story":"Multi-coloured Eurasian Nuthatches have long been a favourite of birdwatchers and their gradual migration north has sent the nationrsquos twitchers into a frenzy.But their arrival in southern Scotland over the last decade is far from good news because it is a sign of just how quickly our planet is heating.Scientists at the Zoological Society of London , the international conservation charity, have named nuthatches as one of  species displaced by climate change into the UK.And they have done so thanks to twitchers on Twitter.The researchers conducted searches both on Twitter and Google, attributing  out of the  species identied to people posting images online of the animals in unusual places.The study led by Dr Nathalie Pettorelli of ZSLrsquos Institute of Zoology, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, explains that, due to regular sightings from environmentalists, UK wildle is one of the most intensively monitored in the world, but there is very little centralised tracking of species arriving for the first time in the country or moving to places outside their known UK range, due to climate change.The analysis also considered UK Government environment reports as well as  scientic papers, leading to a total of  speciesbeing identied.The research focused solely on species which had established sustainable populations through natural, rather than human-assisted movement.Little evidence for any one group of animals showing resilience to the pressures of climate change were seen, with invertebrates, mammals and birds all seemingly impacted by rising temperatures. Of the  species identied, % were invertebrates, and only one formally classied as an invasive species ndash the leathery sea squirt.This last beastie ndash said to be one of the ugliest animals in the world ndash is now said to be well established on the bottom of the Clyde.The black bee fly ndash which goes by the unappealing Latin name of Anthrax Anthrax ndash arrived in the UK for the first time in .

It is not, however, dangerous.Dr Pettorelli, lead author and senior research fellow at ZSLrsquos Institute of Zoology, said: ldquoWe are currently massively unprepared for the climate-driven movement of species that is happening right now in the UK. As it stands, society is not ready for the redistribution of species, as current policies and agreements are not designed for these novel species and ecological communities ndash particularlythose species have no perceived valueto society.ldquoOur results suggest that many species are on the move in the UK, and that we can expect a lot of changes in the type of nature we will have around us in the coming years. ldquoBut the lack of an integrated national  dedicated to tracking and communicating about species displaced by climate change is currently a hindrance to mitigating those potential ecological, economic and societal associated impacts.Nuthatches are not the only bird on the move. Tropical-looking European bee-eater ndash identied by keen birdwatchers and which have been nesting in Kent and Nottinghamshire ndash are quite a stretch from their natural breeding grounds in Africa, central and southern Europe and East Asia.The study found that % of new species arriving or displaced were cited as having negative impacts on ecological communities and human society.

Brown and his staff deserve every success ndash you can only hope they rise again.However, itrsquos the use of the word lsquoartrsquo when it comes to Brown and his business which troubles me.

Art, in all its forms ndash music, literature, painting, sculpture, dance, cinema ndash should make you see the world in a new way, should illuminate some thought or feeling inside you that yoursquove never experienced before, art should let you look through another personrsquos eyes, art should change you. Art should make you angry, scared, elated, aroused ndash it should grab hold of your heart and mind and shake up the emotional world in which you live. Art should tell you truths you didnrsquot know or were too scared to learn. Art should make you feel awe, pity, wonderment. It should renew you and nourish you. Art should inspire and humble you.Does Brown do any of that  I feel his work is for people who neither like nor trust the idea of art. To me, Brownrsquos paintings are comfy. Brown provides prettiness and safety. Itrsquos a warm bath, and thatrsquos not art. Brownrsquos work is home decor, interior design. Itrsquos meant to make your living room attractive, not to touch your soul or change you.The irony is that while Brown may not be creating lsquoartrsquo, hersquos certainly reflecting culture. Our culture has become lsquocomfy-cosyrsquo, safe and unthreatening when it comes to art, literature and music. In that sense, Brown is entirely in keeping with a culture that doesnrsquot really value ideas.Therersquos a unormity about Brownrsquos art. Itrsquos there to fill a space ndash not in your heart, or soul, or mind ndash but on your wall. Therersquos also a grating ubiquity to Brownrsquos art, at least in Scotland. It fits with our mass-produced, mass-consumed culture. It sits easily alongside tribal tattoos, European city breaks, mindfulness, Love Island, Med holidays, Netflix and chill, retro breakfast cereal, breakfast for dinner, Ed Sheeran wedding songs, banter not a conversation, Sunday at the shopping mall, and arguments in Ikea. Itrsquos safe. Everyone does it. Itrsquos moribund.Itrsquos also understandable. Itrsquos not hard to work out why so many now chose cultural comfort rather than a cultural challenge. Our world is horrible. The news frightening. Bank accounts depleting. Hate festering. Progress offers only pain. Why not chose the equivalent of easy-listening when it comes to culture, rather than something which unsettles or questions you.:Neil Mackay: Why the Plan B path to independence reveals a world of pain for the SNPHowever,we wrap ourselves in a cultural comfort blanket wersquoll stagnate, calcy. Art is the hard abrasive necessary to keep culture on its toes, to fend off entropy.Wersquove ceased to exist lsquoinsidersquo culture. Now we lsquoconsumersquo culture from without. For something to be consumed it must be easily digestible. No wonder that bland art is called pablum ndash gruel made for weaning infants. And our lsquoartrsquo is infantilising us.Think of music. The common theme in so much mainstream music is \"yoursquore great, you can do it, the world will love you, success waits around the corner\". Le is a constant summer festival and sooner or later yoursquore going to take to the main stage. Literature has been reduced to what supermarket buyers think a good book is ndash a -page pitch for a B movie thatrsquoll never get made. Cinema is a repeating rhythm of superheroes.Mattel is creating a Barbie dressed as David Bowiersquos Ziggy Stardust for the adult market. Grown-ups queue to see Toy Story. No wonder. Wersquove made children of ourselves. Wersquore all guilty of it.Of course, great music, literature and cinema is still being made, but itrsquos increasingly pushed to the fringes, while the centre-ground keeps growing. Irsquom not saying therersquos no place for mere entertainment, and everything should be high art. Irsquom saying that the middle of the road is now the only path to travel.So much of culture is now like a recurring meme, reflecting how the digital rather than the artistic is now the great cultural driver. Perhaps, the meme is the biggest cultural development of late. Brownrsquos art is meme-like ndash he repeats the same images over and over. The simpler it is, the more wersquoll buy it.Our lsquocomfyrsquo culture makes even discussing such issues dficult. To subject Brown to scrutiny as his company fails will be seen by many as cruel instead of what it is: a timely assessment of someone with a position in Scottish culture. To wonder what people see in paintings like McCoo ndash to suggest money may be better spent on a good print from an art store ndash is to risk being labelled an elitist snob. What could be worse in our cosy anti-intellectual society But Brown should be subjected to scrutiny as he affects Scottish culture and how itrsquos perceived. His images of cows with Saltires on their horns are seen by the world as saying something about Scotland. To me, it risks saying that wersquore a sentimental and frivolous people.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmViews are being sought on a strategy for the development of hydrogen projects in the county.

Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “HIAL’s commitment to access for all passengers has been recognised for a third year by the CAA, acknowledging the hard work by all our staff to ensure our airports are as inclusive as possible.#As an organisation, we work with local disability organisations and iniduals to ensure we are always improving our offerings to better meet their needs and provide assistance where required.“For Kirkwall to be listed as Very Good in its first year of reaching the required passenger threshold is a testament to the hard work staff put in to accommodate disabled and mobility restricted passengers.“Kirkwall has made several upgrades to its facilities for those with additional needs in recent years including changing the flooring in the security area from carpet to lino and adding additional counter space in disabled toilets.“We continue to invest and improve and will provide staff with additional disabilities training.#The CAA’s framework was introduced to ensure there is a consistent and high-quality service for disabled passengers across UK airports. The CAA assesses airports against a number of measures to establish how well they are performing for disabled passengers.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The UK is below average among leading economies in the OECD group of countries in terms ofof dedicated paternity leave offered, though it is highest onof maternity leave, demonstrating the size of the current discrepancy.Mrs May said: ldquoThe experience of parenting has changed almost beyond recognition over the past  years, with fathers wanting to share caring responsibilities more equally from the outset.ldquoIn introducing shared parental leave, we have taken signicant steps to support parents to do this, but all too often it is still mothers, not fathers, who shoulder the burden of childcare.ldquoIt is clear that we need to do more and thatrsquos why today we have launched a consultation calling for views on how we can improve the current system. Women and equalities minister Penny Mordaunt added: ldquoFathers should not have to rely on annual and unpaid leavethey want to be involved in the first months of their childrsquos le.Mrs May said the Government also wanted to help parents cope with the ldquounimaginable stress of a premature or sick baby requiring special care.In the UK, an estimated , babies are admitted to neonatal care every year following their birth.For fathers and partners, that means typically their whole two weeks of paternity leave is spent with the mother and baby in hospital.Under the new proposals, parents would receive one week of neonatal leave and pay for every week their baby is in hospital.This would be available to mothers, fathers and partners.Mrs May said:ldquoParents have more than enough on their plates without worrying about their parental leave running out and having toto work before their precious newborn comes home.ldquoThatrsquos not fair and itrsquos not right. So wersquore also proposing a new neonatal leave and pay entitlement to make this time a bit easier for parents whose babies need to spend a prolonged period in neonatal care.The consultation will also consider whether firms should publish their leave, pay and flexible working policies and whether there should be a requirement to consider advertising jobs as ldquoflexible.Mrs May discussed the proposals with parents during a visit to Wimbledon in south-west London.Small business owner Philippa Harris, mother of two-year-old Toby, said she and her husband had been ldquovery lucky as ldquohis organisation fully supported shared parental leave so we took three months each.She told the PA news agency:ldquoI run a small business, so it was really important that I got back to work quite quickly to minimise impact.ldquoI took three months, he took the other three months, that allowed us to have the full six months with Toby at home.She said that the group of parents and Mrs May discussed the proposals for firms to be more open about their parental leave policies.ldquoAsking about the leave almost implies that yoursquore about to take six months to a year off, we really need to be much more open and flexible working is such a big thing, we felt as a group that should really enable change, Mrs Harris said.copy -.

It is they, after all, who made history as ambassadors of humankind, setting foot onto a ­­\u2028far-flung celestial body. Michael Collins, Apollo ’s ­command module pilot, who watched on, fearful that catastrophe would intervene to ensure he would make theto Earth alone, played an integral part in the mission. So too did the many pioneers whose names occupy a mere footnote of history, despite the fact that without their expertise and composure, the disaster Collins feared – or much worse – would have almost inevitably come to pass. The semicentennial celebrations of the Moon landing is an occasion to remember those who occupy the foothills of the credits. One of the statistics surrounding Project Apollo, which seems to me both remarkable and entirely rational, is that around , people were involved in rendering the impossible possible.This army of engineers, scientists, programmers, mathematicians, and technicians defied technological limitations and bureaucratic wrangling to produce approximately five-and-a-half million parts which, working in unison, spirited Apollo’s crew to the Moon and back. : How moon landing conspiracy theories began and why they persist today – Professor Peter Knight:  years since the moon landing: why Scotland is the true home of astronaut Neil ArmstrongIn any other corporate environment, the prospect of workers on the ground feeling disconnected from the mission’s overall goal would barely warrant concern. But Project Apollo’s programme ­manager, George Müller, knew fine well the risks of letting such apathy go unchecked. He ensured the astronauts toured factories across America tasked with manufacturing the spacecraft components. This was no mere public relations exercise. It reminded workers that a single oversight on their part could kill the men standing before them, and it forged a sense of collective responsibility. Nowhere was this esprit de corps more evident than Building  of Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, home to the Apollo mission operations control centre , where the spacecraft’s ­navigation, propulsion, le support, and communications systems were monitored with unflinching ­scrutiny.At any given time, between  and  men – and one trailblazing woman, JoAnn Morgan, the instrumentation controller – held in their hands the lives of three men a ­quarter of a million miles away. Their number included Stephen Bales, the son of a janitor and a ­beautician, who less than five years previously had moved from the farming community of Fremont, Iowa, to join Nasa as an intern, responsible for guided tours. In an interview with  Minutes to the Moon, a superb BBC World Service podcast detailing the graft, ingenuity, and composure which underpinned the final descent to the lunar surface, Bales recently reflected on the mission that would define his career. Without him, it would have probably ended in failure. As the Eagle craft neared the Moon, an alarm code known as  flashed on its on-board computer display. It was the only moment in the entire mission when a degree of urgency,not fear, could be heard in Armstrong’s voice.Bales, by then one of Apollo ’s guidance officers, saw the alarm four seconds later. Initially unsure of its signicance, he remembered the last simulation he and the flight controllers had carried out before the landing proper. Back then a similar code, known as , had appeared, prompting Bales to call an abort. In the subsequent debriefing, he immersed himself in the myriad alarms that could be triggered, working with Jack Garman, a computer specialist, to understand their meaning.In doing so, they realised a  referred to a software reboot which cancelled all the processes that the computer was running crucially, it happened so fast, no vital guidance or navigation data would be lost. So when the code appeared for real, Bales knew the mission could continue. It was a decision made in the space of  seconds – “an eternity,” said Bales – but it saved Apollo . There are countless other stories like his. Take that of John Aaron from Oklahoma, the son of a cattle rancher and a minister, recruited by Nasa at  without an interview. He felt ashe had walked into a foreign country where people spoke another language, on account of the dizzying number of acronyms being hurled around.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”.

I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example.

Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian.

We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector.

However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38323328.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/porto.jpg","title":"portrush traders hoping for a longterm lift from open","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That was up by % in , when , were caught.The highest speed recorded was mph on both the M Southbound in South Yorkshire and the M Eastbound in Avon and Somerset- more than twice the national speed limit.Brake called for an automatic driving ban for those caught travelling at over mph and greater resources provided to the police to help improve speeding enforcement.Drivers caught speeding at more than mph are referred to court, where magistrates have the discretion to issue a driving ban or six penalty points on a drivers licence. The maximum fine for serious speeding offences is £,, rising to £,caught on a motorway.Joshua Harris, director of campaigns for Brake, said:“There is absolutely no justication for any driver to be travelling at such excessive speeds – more than twice the national speed limit in some cases – putting themselves and others in grave danger.\"The number of drivers caught speeding at over mph highlights some deeply concerning issues with speeding across the country and makes clear the need for action. Anyone caught travelling at such speed should always face a ban – we have to make sure these dangerous, selfish drivers are taken off our roads.“The Government must invest in national roads policing as a priority to provide the police with the resources they need to get out on the roads and act as a true deterrent to dangerous driving. The law must also be used to its fullest extent in penalising such dangerous behaviour, making it clear that speeding will not be tolerated.” Four forces recorded more than , motorists exceeding mph last year. West Yorkshire police recorded the most with , followed by Kent Police with , then West Mercia Police with , and Surrey police with ,.Inspector Rosemary Leech: “The position of the Police Service of Northern Ireland on speeding is absolutely clear. “Excessive speed for the conditions is consistently one of the principal causes of the most serious road traffic collisions in which people are killed or seriously injured on roads across Northern Ireland.  “Drivers have to take responsibility for their own actions and by speeding they are causing a danger to fellow road users. “Every time you hear about a fatal or serious collision on the news, there is a family, a circle of friends, a community plunged into mourning.  There are many other people across the country how are having to learn how to cope with le changing injuries after being involved in serious collisions.“This is why it is critically important to remind all drivers that there are consequences to breaking the speed limit and driving in a manner that does not consider the safety of all road users. Police will continue to enforce the law and are determined to make Northern Irelands roads safer. “In , the number of speeding detections rose by .% from the previous year, consequently the number of offenders who are caught travelling at higher speeds is also likely to increase. “Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le changing injuries.“If everyone slowed down, did not drive after drinking or taking drugs, wore a seatbelt and drove with greater care and attention then together we can save lives on our roads.”"},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach should contact parties before discussing backstop change sinn fein","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So we’re also proposing a new neonatal leave and pay entitlement to make this time a bit easier for parents whose babies need to spend a prolonged period in neonatal care.”The consultation will also consider whether firms should publish their leave, pay and flexible working policies and whether there should be a requirement to consider advertising jobs as “flexible”.Mrs May discussed the proposals with parents during a visit to Wimbledon in south-west London.Small business owner Philippa Harris, mother of two-year-old Toby, said she and her husband had been “very lucky” as “his organisation fully supported shared parental leave so we took three months each”.She told the PA news agency: “I run a small business, so it was really important that I got back to work quite quickly to minimise impact.“I took three months, he took the other three months, that allowed us to have the full six months with Toby at home.”She said that the group of parents and Mrs May discussed the proposals for firms to be more open about their parental leave policies.“Asking about the leave almost implies that you’re about to take six months to a year off, we really need to be much more open and flexible working is such a big thing, we felt as a group that should really enable change,” Mrs Harris said."},{"url":null,"title":"airline klm criticised for asking breastfeeding mothers to cover up","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester.

There is currently, after years of campaigning, a genuine momentum of support building in Dublin and in London for a new university here.“We need to harness this carefully and creatively, to deliver a standalone Higher Education institution for our city region.“There is a real chance to redress  years of isolation and alienation and to build hope and prosperity for future generations in northwest Ireland.“We must be careful not to be side-tracked into short-term fixes as we have been before. We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity and build a new, dedicated university in the North West.”The Derry University Group, which is based at Ráth Mór, was established in  by Conal McFeely, Diane Greer and Garbhan Downey.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"eamonn mccann derry treated contempt nationalist leadership","story":"By Eamonn McCanngoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe neglect of Derry on both university education and rail links has been blamed for  years on sectarian unionism.There is a great deal of truth in this - but it’s not the whole truth.The same neglect has continued under politicians wearing green jerseys.It is half a century since unionism held sway in these parts.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances.

Irsquom still in shock, she confessed.The highly-dedicated athlete didnrsquot start the competition that well, but she recovered well to lt bronze.ldquoI had a bad first shoot, which I put down to nerves. I then I had to work my way from the back over the next few circuits.Good shoots and strong running in the next three circuits is what helped to pull me up to bronze, she continued.ldquoMadeira was amazing.

That is just an insult,” Edward O’Neill told the News Letter.Prorogation is the formal process that signals the end of a parliamentary session and brings nearly all Westminster business to a closeDuring a Lords’ debate on the Bill on Wednesday night, NIO minister Lord Duncan gave an assurance that all eligibility criteria procedures for a pension will “abide by the ‘no fault of their own’ principle”.Lord Duncan’s remarks followed the proposal from former NI secretary Lord Hain that: “The secretary of state must make regulations to give effect to a pension for those severely injured through no fault of their own during the period known as the Northern Ireland Troubles.”However, the wording of the final amendment, which was among a number of changes ratied by MPs on Thursday, stops short of blocking payments to former paramilitaries.The clause states: “Regulations ... must make provision as to the eligibility criteria for payments under the scheme which may, in particular, relate to: the nature or extent of a person’s injury how, when or where the injury was sustained ... and whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence”, and adds, “payments to be reduced or repaidin specied circumstances”.DUP peer Lord Morrow said he was “not entirely happy,” but added: “We did seek some assurances, and we got those assurances.”He said: “Whenever Lord Hain said that he was making it abundantly clear, that his aim was that a victim, in his opinion, was someone hurt at the hand of someone  in other words, it wasn’t self-inflicted.“If a victim is not treated as a victim, and a victim maker is not treated as a victim maker, then we will continue to have this problem and we will be ing to it.”Abortion: Radical liberalisation of NI law backed by huge majority as MPs Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Lord Empey said he had serious concerns over the speed at which the legislation was being rushed through the Commons, but said there have been y discussions around the definition of a victim in the Lords.“I think we are reasonably reassured but, when you are dealing with so many issues in the space of two days, it’s not the way to do business. But I think we’ve done the best we could in the time available.”Lord Empey said it was worth noting that, although the wording of the Lord Hain proposal stops short of blocking terrorists from accessing a pension, the debates in the Lords made it clear that the will of Parliament was former paramilitaries should not benefit. “Every single speaker took the same position,” Lord Empey added.“I’m not a lawyer, but the intention of the House could not have been clearer. In specic regard to the pension, I am happier today with what the minister has put on record,” • Two senior Alliance representatives have been challenged over claims only a small number of former paramilitaries are likely to benefit from the proposed Troubles pension.Stephen Farry tweeted his support for a Troubles pension to be implemented, and said: “This can’t be constantly held back due to a debate on where less than  people are in or out.”Trevor Lunn supported his party colleague, saying: “Less than a dozen perpetrators, half of whom would refuse a British pension anyway. Time to move on, swallow the pill for the greater good.”Mairia Cahill said she was “shocked” at the Alliance assertion, and added: “The scheme is open which means figures would change – however the real danger is the precedent it sets.”Former senior police officer Jim Gamble tweeted: “The slippery slope is suggesting that because less than  paramilitary thugs will receive a state pension paid by the taxes of their victims that some greater good is being achieved. Any terrorist receiving payment is wrong  you know it. You are on the slippery slope.”Stephen Farry’s tweet in full said: “Definition of a victim has been a long-running political issue. There are hundreds and hundreds of victims that continue to suffer from le-limiting conditions and urgently need help. This can’t be constantly held back due to a debate on where less than  people are in or out.”Mr Farry was responding to a comment from UUP MLA Doug Beattie, that said: “Perpetrators should not benefit from any Victims and Survivors Pension. We fully support a pension for innocent victims but it is not acceptable to include those injured by their own hand.” try catch  TrendingTributes paid to Northern Ireland road racer Darren Keys following fatal crash at WalderstownThe Twelfth  -

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The UK is below average among leading economies in the OECD group of countries in terms ofof dedicated paternity leave offered, though it is highest onof maternity leave, demonstrating the size of the current discrepancy.Mrs May said: ldquoThe experience of parenting has changed almost beyond recognition over the past  years, with fathers wanting to share caring responsibilities more equally from the outset.ldquoIn introducing shared parental leave, we have taken signicant steps to support parents to do this, but all too often it is still mothers, not fathers, who shoulder the burden of childcare.ldquoIt is clear that we need to do more and thatrsquos why today we have launched a consultation calling for views on how we can improve the current system. Women and equalities minister Penny Mordaunt added: ldquoFathers should not have to rely on annual and unpaid leavethey want to be involved in the first months of their childrsquos le.Mrs May said the Government also wanted to help parents cope with the ldquounimaginable stress of a premature or sick baby requiring special care.In the UK, an estimated , babies are admitted to neonatal care every year following their birth.For fathers and partners, that means typically their whole two weeks of paternity leave is spent with the mother and baby in hospital.Under the new proposals, parents would receive one week of neonatal leave and pay for every week their baby is in hospital.This would be available to mothers, fathers and partners.Mrs May said:ldquoParents have more than enough on their plates without worrying about their parental leave running out and having toto work before their precious newborn comes home.ldquoThatrsquos not fair and itrsquos not right. So wersquore also proposing a new neonatal leave and pay entitlement to make this time a bit easier for parents whose babies need to spend a prolonged period in neonatal care.The consultation will also consider whether firms should publish their leave, pay and flexible working policies and whether there should be a requirement to consider advertising jobs as ldquoflexible.Mrs May discussed the proposals with parents during a visit to Wimbledon in south-west London.Small business owner Philippa Harris, mother of two-year-old Toby, said she and her husband had been ldquovery lucky as ldquohis organisation fully supported shared parental leave so we took three months each.She told the PA news agency:ldquoI run a small business, so it was really important that I got back to work quite quickly to minimise impact.ldquoI took three months, he took the other three months, that allowed us to have the full six months with Toby at home.She said that the group of parents and Mrs May discussed the proposals for firms to be more open about their parental leave policies.ldquoAsking about the leave almost implies that yoursquore about to take six months to a year off, we really need to be much more open and flexible working is such a big thing, we felt as a group that should really enable change, Mrs Harris said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May launches consultation on shake-up of parental leave system article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Entries are now open for the  Deloitte Technology Fast  programme. The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
