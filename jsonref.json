Muhammad studied the Quran under Emer for six years as a kid, following him from house to house in an effort to dodge the authorities. Muhammad said Emer was so respected that the police would phone him with warnings ahead of time before raiding classes at his modest, single-story home of brick and mud.Though Emer gave Party-approved sermons, he refused to preach Communist propaganda, Muhammad said, eventually running into trouble with the authorities. He was stripped of his position as an imam and barred from teaching in 1997, amid unrest roiling the region.         In this 2017 file photo Uighur security personnel patrol near the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar in western China\u0027s Xinjiang regionWhen Muhammad left China for Saudi Arabia and Turkey in 2009, Emer was making his living as a doctor of traditional medicine. Emer was growing old, and under heavy surveillance, he had stopped attending religious gatherings.That didn\u0027t stop authorities from detaining the imam, who is in his eighties, and sentencing him on various charges for up to 12 years in prison over 2017 and 2018. The database cites four charges in various entries: \u0027stirring up terrorism\u0027, acting as an unauthorized \u0027wild\u0027 imam, following the strict Saudi Wahhabi sect and conducting illegal religious teachings.Muhammad called the charges false. Emer had stopped his preaching, practiced a moderate Central Asian sect of Islam rather than Wahhabism and never dreamed of hurting others, let alone stirring up \u0027terrorism,\u0027 Muhammad said.\u0027He used to always preach against violence,\u0027 Muhammad said. \u0027Anyone who knew him can testify that he wasn\u0027t a religious extremist.\u0027None of Emer\u0027s three sons had been convicted of a crime. But the database shows that over the course of 2017, all were thrown into the detention camps for having too many children, trying to travel abroad, being \u0027untrustworthy\u0027 or \u0027infected with religious extremism,\u0027or going on the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. It also shows that their relation to Emer and their religious background was enough to convince officials they were too dangerous to let out from the detention camps.\u0027His father taught him how to pray,\u0027 notes one entry for his eldest, Ablikim Memtimin.\u0027His family\u0027s religious atmosphere is thick. We recommend he (Emer) continue training,\u0027 says another entry for his youngest son, Emer Memtimin.Even a neighbor was tainted by living near him, with Emer\u0027s alleged crimes and prison sentence recorded in the neighbor\u0027s dossier.The database indicates much of this information is collected by teams of cadres stationed at mosques, sent to visit homes and posted in communities. This information is then compiled in a dossier called the \u0027three circles\u0027, encompassing their relatives, community, and religious background.It wasn\u0027t just the religious who were detained. The database shows that Karakax officials also explicitly targeted people for activities that included going abroad, getting a passport or installing foreign software.         A Muslim Uighur woman walks with her son past security forces in the town of Kashgar, Xinjiang Province in April  2008Pharmacist Tohti Himit was detained in a camp for having gone multiple times to one of 26 \u0027key\u0027 countries, mostly Muslim, according to the database. Former employee Habibullah, who is now in Turkey, recalled Himit as a secular, kind and wealthy man who kept his face free of a beard.\u0027He wasn\u0027t very pious, he didn\u0027t go to the mosque,\u0027 said Habibullah, who declined to give his first name out of fear of retribution against family still in China. \u0027I was shocked by how absurd the reasons for detention were.\u0027The database says cadres found Himit had attended his grandfather\u0027s funeral at a local mosque on March 10, 2008. Later that year, the cadres found, he had gone to the same mosque again, once to worship and once to celebrate a festival. In 2014 he had gone to Anhui province, in inner China, to get a passport and go abroad.That, the government concluded, was enough to show that Himit was \u0027certainly dangerous.\u0027 They ordered Himit to stay in the center and \u0027continue training.\u0027Emer is now under house arrest due to health issues, his former student, Muhammad, has heard. It\u0027s unclear where Emer\u0027s sons are.It was the imam\u0027s courage and stubbornness that did him in, Muhammad said. Though deprived of his mosque and his right to teach, Emer quietly defied the authorities for two decades by staying true to his faith.\u0027Unlike some other scholars, he never cared about money or anything else the Communist Party could give him,\u0027 Muhammad said. \u0027He never bowed down to them - and that\u0027s why they wanted to eliminate him.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2817108942eb7193a361f9ae9f90ec0e43d784c5/0_2_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=986a2cfdcd1ac6d6275fb121cbc6c388","title":"va museum of childhood set to close for 13m revamp","story":"London museum will shut in May and reopen in 2022 with new spaces that are ‘less about nostalgia’ The V\u0026ampA’s Museum of Childhood is to get a £13m revamp to create spaces that are less about nostalgia and more about encouraging young people to change the world.Details and concept drawings were revealed on Monday of a radical re-imagining of what the building in Bethnal Green, east London, should be.The building is to close for two years and when it reopens in 2022, there will be more objects going on display from the V\u0026ampA’s wider collections. They include a Superman costume worn by Christopher Reeve, Beatrix Potter’s illustrations of Peter Rabbit and a life-size  horse puppet, Joey, from the West End play War Horse.There will also be examples of contemporary design, such as Olafur Eliasson’s Little Sun solar lamp, on display to encourage young people to experiment and dream up their own ideas.“This will be a V\u0026ampA for young visitors,” said Philippa Simpson, director of design, estate and future plan. “If you imagine South Kensington but rethought totally through the eyes of a child … that’s what we are heading for.”The aim was also to create a more forward-thinking museum. “For the last few decades it has been a site of nostalgia for a lot of people who love it because they show their kids the toys they played with when they were young,” Simpson said.When it reopens there will be more emphasis on unlocking the potential of future generations, the museum added“We want to empower children to realise that every act of creativity is wondrous,” said Tristram Hunt, the director of the V\u0026ampA. “Whether it’s self-expression through their clothes, building a world on Minecraft, or launching a school climate strike.”The museum opened as the Bethnal Green Museum of Science and Arts in 1872, becoming the V\u0026ampA Museum of Childhood in 1974.Many visitors find the Bethnal Green building a dark and cold place so the plan is to create spaces which are more open, exciting and immersive, said the museum.Concept designs by AOC Architecture show rooms inspired by Alice inWonderland and the museum’s main hall reimagined as a town square.Simpson stressed they were “not chucking the baby out with the bath water” and there would still be popular and nostalgic favourites – such as the collection of dolls houses – but displayed differently. “It is about always looking forward rather than just looking back.”Doors will close on 11 May and reopen in 2022 in what will be the museum’s 150th anniversary year. On the May bank holiday before, a three-day festival, RE-INVENT, will be held to signal the new vision.Simpson said it had been impossible to avoid closure because of the scale of the project and the need for total modernisation.“We are looking at every single corner of it and bringing a lot more space into public use,” she said. “It is basically a big Victorian shed so you can’t close off one bit without closing another so we just had to run at it.”There will be three new galleries. “Play” will include everything from the crowdfunded card game Exploding Kittens to chess.“Imagine” will include exploring stories behind characters, whether Paddington Bear, Pikachu or the Loch Ness monster.“Design” will include an artist-in-residence programme entitled the Designer’s House as well as displays which feature examples of contemporary design such as the micro-scooter.Hunt said the aim was offer a free and outstanding day out for children. “Beloved by the local community, but in need of modernisation, this ambitious transformation will enable the V\u0026ampA’s museum of childhood to unlock its huge potential to nurture the potential of future generations and become a global champion of children’s creativity.”The Bethnal Green revamp is part of wider activity in to east London by the V\u0026ampA with a new five-storey museum scheduled to open on the Olympic site in Stratford in 2023. Ten minutes walk away will be the V\u0026ampA’s new storage and research centre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43e2b6be25f249f3606f965acdd7df840ad47f53/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=375f729b9c91be3d51e192835089b86b","title":"citizens assembly climate pointless","story":"A similar set-up broke the political deadlock in Ireland, but the Tories don’t want to hear bold recommendationsWhen MPs announced a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency last June, two crucial things hadn’t yet happened: Boris Johnson’s takeover of the Conservative party and the subsequent general election campaign where the main opposition parties each offered radical plans to address the climate crisis, and then lost to Johnson, who had offered no plan at all.For everyone hoping for action on climate, the election was a particularly bruising experience. First throwing open the door to a previously unthinkable possibility – immediate, concrete plans to fight the crisis, far beyond anything proposed by the inadequate Paris Agreement – and then, just as quickly, slamming that door shut. Perhaps even more tightly than before, given Johnson’s disinterest in all things climate-related. And because now the party without an apparent serious climate plan is in charge of taking the critical first steps towards Theresa May’s government’s goal of hitting net-zero by 2050, while the parties willing to commit to action are shut out of power by the enormous Tory majority.The climate assembly – which met for the second time in Birmingham last weekend – was created to act as a kind of workaround for traditional partisan deadlock, and to chart a safe route forward for governments to act on the climate crisis. Its conceit is that it offers direct access to the real will of the people: 110 citizens – chosen to be representative of the British population – attend sessions where they are briefed by experts on the issue they then come up with a set of policies to solve it. A citizens’ assembly in Ireland helped the government to put forward the referendum that ended that country’s abortion ban last year.The mood at the assembly so far has been hopeful. The setup assumes that our political leaders have the best intentions, but are paralysed by indecision, both because of the unfathomable number of options and the fear that the public will punish them for the wrong choice. The whole function of politics here is outsourced to the public: they’re asked to make their own tough decisions. And so they have sat attentively listening to presentations on the greatest hits of never-tried climate policy, and have been asked to weigh them up. There was mention of personal carbon allowances (be your own carbon market), a very popular idea in 2008, and more recent schemes such as creating nationwide repair networks, and forcing manufacturers to build goods to last.All the solutions presented reflect the mainstream of British climate policy over the past two decades. The experts put forward a fairly cautious mix of technocratic market incentives and regulation, with large spending programmes reserved for infrastructure projects. Still, there were signs that the assembly might take some bold decisions. The experts barely mentioned free public transport, yet were quizzed on it incessantly. And the members wanted to know who was most responsible for emissions, and how they could be made to pay. The polls suggest that public opinion has leapt ahead of the government’s climate ambition over the past year, and it’s possible that the assembly recommendations will confirm that.But even if the assembly puts the most progressive options in front of the government, there’s still the sticky question of implementation. “How can we be sure the government will follow on our recommendations,” an assembly member asked Labour MP Rachel Reeves, one of only three elected officials in attendance. She didn’t have a good answer, but she could easily have told them it’s not on her – she’s only ever been in opposition during her 10-year tenure in parliament. The assembly’s most valuable contribution may be breaking the deadlock between equally effective but controversial policies – a land-use carbon tax or a consumption tax, for example – although the Tories may well choose neither. The problem with how to tackle the climate crisis in the UK is not partisan deadlock, but lack of government interest.A citizens’ assembly can’t change that. Its decisions aren’t guaranteed to sway the government from its prearranged course. The Irish assembly is held up as a model for its recommendations on the abortion referendum. However, it also submitted proposals on the climate crisis, from huge investments in peat restoration and public transport to a tax on agriculture emissions. The Irish government ignored all of these, in favour of what the prime minister, Leo Varadkar, called “ambitious but realistic” policies to “nudge people to change behaviour”. Nudging people towards radical change is a depressing continuation of the managerial away-day optimism that has dominated thinking on the climate crisis over the past 20 years. One would have better luck trying to nudge a stream back up a mountain.Instead, the best chance for tackling the crisis comes from politicians and parties who don’t wait for incremental solutions. Party politics has become an unexpected laboratory for fusing climate policies to big, popular, social spending programmes – based on the model of a green new deal, which was first put forward by experts in 2008. Unlike a sitting government, opposition policy shops are a frictionless environment: ambition can be doubled and redoubled without pushback.And if the programmes capture the public attention, they are quickly copied by other parties. Labour proposed a green industrial revolution based on using the resources of the state to foster green industries, creating jobs and increasing living standards. This in turn pushed the Liberal Democrats to try to match the offer – remarkable for a party committed to the decentralisation of state power. In the US, the Bernie Sanders campaign is not only currently leading the polls to win the Democratic nomination with the Green New Deal as a top-line policy, it has also pushed every other candidate towards embracing the idea – something that would have seemed impossible just four years ago. For a long time it has been assumed that public opinion is a barrier to climate action. But the climate assembly will likely confirm what the polls have been indicating for the past year: that people are now ready to move further and faster on climate action than the minimal effort shown by the government. If their advice is ignored or diluted beyond recognition, then maybe citizens’ assemblies are an imperfect mechanism for the scale of change needed to tackle the climate crisis. Only a green new deal for the UK will do.• Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068216b9c9f8882406d57a421a22333984d78edd/0_365_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17f91cbd9ef72cb6fc477877aaa3cdf5","title":"wuhan china doctors coronavirus","story":"Doctors are told not to cause alarm over coronavirus, social media posts are deleted and vital information is dismissed as rumour• The author is a Chinese writer living in north AmericaI got a phone call from Dr Song* one night. He had just finished a shift at a hospital in Wuhan and was about to go back to work again. He told me it had been weeks since he had had a full night of sleep or a day off. He couldn’t remember the last time he had spent time with his family or eaten a warm meal. At work, he wraps himself in raincoats due to a lack of protective gear across the hospital. Some of his colleagues wear diapers to work to avoid having to remove their protective suits.“Maybe you can write something to let the patients know we have all tried our best,” he said. Just a few hours before, when a patient had died at a Wuhan hospital, family members had beaten up and severely injured two doctors. Even though he and his coworkers were working non-stop – overwhelmed, under-equipped and exhausted – they still faced a backlash from patients, many of whom he had to reject due to the lack of hospital beds. Some left disappointedly. Others abused him.I got to know Song when I was helping a medical supplies donation group. He was not the only one pleading for help via social media – I was contacted by dozens of medical workers, who all described a desperate situation. I also received a lot of pleas for help from patients. They had been waiting in packed hospital lobbies for days, in fear of being left untested, untreated and ultimately dying from what is now officially called Covid-19. Some people had felt ill for almost a week, and in that time, their family members had started to feel ill as well. But they had a long wait to be diagnosed and treated.Lin*, a college student, started to feel light-headed and thought she had caught a cold – at the time, there was still no official information about the coronavirus outbreak – but her condition deteriorated drastically. The ban on local transport meant that she and her mother had to walk for hours to get to the hospital. She waited in the lobby for an entire night, then was given some medicine and advised to come back the next day in case there were coronavirus testing kits available.She was diagnosed at the end of January. So was her mother, who was infected while taking care of her. They were told again and again to remain confined at home and wait to be taken to hospital. As time went by, her messages seemed more and more depressed. One night, she told me that she felt like she was waiting to die. The last time we spoke, she was back at the hospital, waiting again: “If there is only one bed, I will let my mother take it. Her health is declining rapidly. I will quarantine myself at home.” She couldn’t stop crying.Lin is not alone. On Weibo, one of the biggest social media platforms in China, there is a group of more than 150,000 people – mostly patients and their families – asking for help. Reading through the posts, it’s clear there is a shortage of everything. Many people have to decide whether to prioritise their mother or daughter, grandson or grandfather, wife or husband.Knowing how both medical workers and patients are struggling, I couldn’t stop thinking about what caused all these tragedies in a country that should have learned a lot from its Sars outbreak 17 years ago.According to the Financial Times, there was at least a three-week period when Wuhan authorities were aware the virus was spreading but “issued orders to suppress the news”. In early January, eight medical professionals were reprimanded by the police for rumour-mongering, including Dr Li Wenliang – the whistleblower who died from the disease – who has become a symbol of public frustration over the Chinese government’s censorship and poor management. These “rumours” were actually based on infection cases in hospitals in Wuhan, and if the government had instead put its energy into investigating these cases, then lives could have been saved.In mid-January, a nurse told me that medical workers in Wuhan had been advised to not wear protective gear to avoid causing panic. Later, Song told me that medical workers had been advised not to appeal for help on public media outlets. Now 1,700 medical workers nationwide have been infected.Even now, when the virus has made 70,000 people sick and taken more than 1,700 lives, the government is still trying to hide information. Thousands of posts were deleted from the online group asking for help, including Lin’s. I was told by editors of Chinese media outlets that I couldn’t write about anything that reflected negatively on the government.It is not new for figures in government to put their political interests ahead of public health. But given the rapid spread of the virus and the gravity of the situation in China, I thought the government could put aside the censorship and propaganda for a while. I was wrong. * Dr Song and Lin are pseudonyms• The author is a Chinese writer living in north America"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52c8b65bd7c2066f46d49dc8f18aa010d0699c44/0_19_3979_2388/master/3979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bf723194cf2a069f4f210e9609eee36","title":"canal istanbul erdogans crazy plan to plot route between black and marmara seas","story":"Proposed route slices through a major drinking water source and an important stop for migratory birds To the west of Istanbul, between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, lie erse landscapes of forest, farms, marshes and ancient settlements. Following a curving line from north to south would connect you through the Terkos Lake, Sazlıdere stream and reservoir and Küçükçekmece lagoon, important water sources for migratory birds – not to mention the city’s residents.This line, however, is also the path of Kanal İstanbul, a $12.6bn(£9.7bn) mega-infrastructure plan described by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as his “crazy project” when he first mentioned the idea in 2011.Kanal İstanbul, approved by the environment ministry last month, would be a 45km (28 mile) shipping canal joining the Black Sea to the Marmara, running parallel to the Bosphorus strait, which already cuts through the centre of Istanbul. The government says the canal is needed to reduce water traffic through the city.Critics – who include the mayor of Istanbul – warn of a great environmental cost, including the potential ecological destruction of the Marmara Sea. There is a delicate ecological balance between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, currently connected by the Bosphorus strait.“The salinity of Black Sea is less than Marmara Sea, and the organic content of Black Sea is much higher than that of Marmara Sea,” says Cevahir Efe Akçelik, Istanbul secretary of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects.Because the Black Sea is 50cm higher than the Marmara, both the level and salinity density would change if the two were connected by the canal.Not only that, the flow of cellular organisms into the Marmara would eat up extra oxygen.The loss of oxygen could see bacteria and other organisms create a sulphurous gas, the scent of which could spread across Istanbul like rotten eggs. And there are fears it could wipe out life in the Marmara entirely.“Some oceanographers say 30 years later there will be no oxygen left in the Marmara Sea. It’s a really harmful and dangerous project.” said AkçelikOne section also directly threatens Istanbul’s water supply. Terkos Lake and Sazlıdere reservoir provide a quarter of the city’s drinking water the city has drawn water from the lake since the Roman period and it has always been regarded symbolically as Istanbul’s main water source.Should those reserves be lost, Akçelik says, there is no alternative water source on the European side of Istanbul. Instead the government would have to pump water from the Sakarya River, deep on the Asian side.That would be much more expensive. It also carries health hazards, given the river passes through Turkey’s capital, Ankara, and through polluted industrial areas to reach the Black Sea.The canal would also destroy Küçükçekmece lagoon, which in turn could see hundreds of different species vanish, scientists warn. The lagoon is an important stop for migratory birds, particularly the Cetti’s warbler, grey heron, eastern imperial eagle and the flamingo, who all lay their eggs in Küçükçekmece.“If you lose that lake, you lose not only a drinking water source, but a really important ecology,” Akçelik says.The ministry of environment and urbanisation opened the project to public consultation. More than 70,000 people signed a petition against it.The mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, who is affiliated with Turkey’s main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), has been at loggerheads over the project with Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).İmamoğlu has started to campaign publicly against the canal, and the municipality is taking legal action to halt construction.According to the head of the zoning and urbanisation department, Gürkan Akgün, the objections made by public institutions, non-governmental organisations and residents have been ignored.“The north end of Istanbul is the life support system for all of us,” he says. “It all will disappear irreversibly with this project.”He argues that the ministry’s report contains “erroneous assumptions and insufficient analytical surveys” and says the city is appealing the decision.Greenpeace has submitted an appeal of its own.“In many respects, Istanbul, one of the most important and unique cities in the world, is going to be thrown into disaster with this unpredictable project,” says Greenpeace’s Mediterranean program director, Deniz Bayram.The national government and the city’s ministry for environment and urbanisation did not respond to requests for comment. Erdoğan has said there is no alternative to the Kanal İstanbul project for limiting traffic through the Bosphorus, and claimed all appropriate environmental and technical surveys have been undertaken.The Bosphorus strait is an internationally important shipping route. Around 48,000 ships pass through its waters annually, including oil tankers and war ships. The government claims there are risks posed by ships carrying dangerous goods.The construction of new petroleum and natural gas pipelines between countries has meant less reliance on ships and tankers to transport resources.Accidents have been falling as well, according to municipal officials, who point to improvements in maritime transport and shipping sector technology. “For many years, we have not encountered a serious accident in the Bosphorus and I hope we will not in the future,” Akgün says.Akçelik says he believes the true long-term aim of the canal, rather than easing shipping traffic, is to create a major infrastructure project north of the city to spur development.“The main idea is creating a new city in northern Istanbul,” Akçelik explained.Akgün agrees and says he believes the new works will significantly disrupt the area’s climate. “The construction areas to be formed around it will transform into an urban heat island, changing the temperature, humidity, evaporation and wind regimes in a very short time,” he says.“Considering all these points, it becomes clearer what kind of an environmental disaster we are facing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd22a8b284ef830583c71ec60fc5a122d0172fe/0_7_4151_2491/master/4151.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6e3d1141ed316d4c6c31bdfab203465","title":"ireland revokes license of livestock ship operator over low performance rating","story":"Decision concerns two ships regularly transporting live animals to the Middle East, prompting questions about monitoring of fleetThe Irish government revoked approvals for the operator of two regular livestock carriers, the Atlantic M and the Express 1, last week, following questions from the  and Irish farm animal welfare organisation Ethical Farming Ireland (EFI). Internal emails appear to show that Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) was unaware that the performance ratings for the ships’ operator was below the required standard until a campaigner from EFI got in touch last year.Last week DAFM told the  it had written to the “owneroperator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1 regarding the department’s intention to revoke their approval … once the department became aware of the performance rating”.“The operator was given 14 days to make representations”, the email went on to say, before the “ownersoperator’s approval was subsequently revoked”.Shipping is an opaque and complex area, however, all the more so when live animals are involved. In 2016, to complement EU law, Ireland introduced another layer of regulation on the carriage of livestock by sea.The regulations stipulate that the performance level of companies operating livestock vessels “must not be listed as ‘low or very low’ on the performance tables of Port State Control published by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)”.But the operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1, two ships that regularly carry livestock from Ireland, fell into EMSA’s “low or very low” bracket. The EMSA website and Panama-based shipping registration service, PMA Certification, show both vessels are operated by Turkish company Emiroglu Deniz Nakliyati. The list is updated daily and relates to the previous 36 months. contacted DAFM to ask for more information about the situation. On 10 February the department replied, saying that it had revoked the operator’s approval for both ships. Questions about the future of both ships, or the approval of a new operator, were not answered.Emails seen by the  indicate that the DAFM was previously unaware that the safety and compliance manager for the Atlantic M and Express 1 was on the EMSA’s “low or very low performance” list.In an interview with the , the ships’ former safety management company, the Istanbul-based Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyatı, confirmed that the DAFM had revoked their approval in January this year because the company was on the EMSA’s low-performing list. Explaining the rating, Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyati’s operations manager Erhan Çavdar said this had followed the detainment of some of its ships. One of the detained ships was the Atlantic M.Caroline Rowley of EFI told the  she had emailed the DAFM on 30 December, raising concerns about the Atlantic M and the Express 1. The same day, the DAFM raised those concerns with the ships’ management in an email marked “urgent”. Earlier in December, Rowley had also notified the DAFM about problems with the operator of a third Irish livestock carrier, the Sarah M. At that point, the Sarah M was operated by the Beirut Shipping Company, whose performance was listed by EMSA as “low or very low”. The Sarah M is now operated by DMS lines, which is not on the low or very low listing.Despite Rowley’s emails, which the department acknowledged, the next Sarah M cattle shipment went ahead at the end of 2019. tried to contact the Beirut Shipping Company, but was told by Farouk El Murr, who works for the Sarah M’s current operator, DMS Lines, based at the same address, that the Beirut Shipping Company had closed in “late December, early January”. El Murr said the closure had come “after its licence was revoked by the Irish DAFM because it was on the low or very low performing EMSA list”. An Irish marine law expert, who has asked to remain anonymous, told the  that the Irish carriage of livestock regulations appeared to make no provision for monitoring any changes to an operator’s rating. Nor, the lawyer said, do they appear to require an operator to inform the DAFM if it is placed on the EMSA’s “low or very low performance” list after it has been approved.Responding to the lawyer’s comments, the DAFM said the “system for the approval of vessels for the carriage of livestock in Ireland involves a comprehensive inspection by a marine surveyor and by a departmental veterinarian to determine the suitability of the vessel for that particular purpose”.“In addition to that, the department requires the vessel to have a valid classification certificate issued by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. This is clearly not the sole requirement for approval.”Rowley fears that if she had not contacted the DAFM, “these vessels would still be operating in breach of regulations with the department being none the wiser.”She said there is a wider issue in the way that these regulations are being monitored and what seems to be a gap between what the agriculture department says and what it does. “The DAFM prides itself on its exceptionally high standards. But when we see vessels with operating companies that don’t meet the criteria, vessels transferred to new operators just a few weeks after we send emails, we have to wonder whether anyone really cares about those animals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea6d012422bd0fe5c1c80c20d6aa5f676a8b4cf/0_1674_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d081e7d0f344d75297f915d8f207fc3","title":"spring clean the key looks from the new collections in pictures","story":"Power shoulders, pastels, frills and black tie dressing, we take some of the trends from the SS20 season for a spin• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7863867c40c8715a756d7fbd08c8e33bc5ac6ffb/0_221_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e651b5e53f28d535697827708af27623","title":"forget models walking in straight lines why a new generation are sashaying down the catwalk","story":"There are a few moments every fashion month that puncture the industry bubble. This season it came with J-Lo’s surprise appearance on the Versace catwalk. Sashaying, hips swaying, arms swooping, moving her dress as if on the cusp of flight, it created that most modern of reactions: “melting” the internet.Another such moment wasn’t from a megastar, but a relative unknown, 20-year-old model Leon Dame, who marched down the Maison Margiela runway, jerky and inelegant, legs crossing fiercely each step, neck jutting forwards. The video of him walking received tens of thousands of likes. Rihanna even started following him. Both brought into focus the power of the catwalk walk, a phenomenon as old as the catwalk itself – and one that, right now, is threatening to distract from the clothes.As Derek Zoolander himself knows, walking isn’t as easy as it looks. Model Veronica Webb likens it to “when you see a swan gliding across a pond – below the surface the poor beast is pedalling like mad”. Then there’s the coordination needed to be part of a troupe of models all walking at once: “What happens when a traffic jam meets a beauty contest? A fashion show!” she says. “Navigating through the other models, then getting the perfect picture at the end of the runway takes trial and error.”Now, there is more of an emphasis on performance. See Issey Miyake, a brand known for its theatrical shows, where models this season upped the ante, twirling, ballet-dancing and skateboarding. Or the Charles Jeffrey show which was, says model Lorna Foran, “choreographed from start to finish”. For the finale, she and other models were instructed to stop “and almost act as if you were engulfed by euphoria!”“Maison Margiela asked us to look weird and fierce,” says Steinberg, another model. The Row’s Olsen sisters requested that models “walk slow and a bit romantic”, according to one, Lia Pavlova. Alessandro Michele wanted Gucci model Delphi McNicol to move “as I would walking down the street”.In real life, gait is often considered a signifier of identity, as unique as handwriting or voice. We see a friend from a distance and recognise their gait before their face. Gait can mask fictional criminals – see Kevin Spacey’s faux limp in The Usual Suspects – and, as scientists have found, can help the police catch real ones, too. That our walks are identifiable is remarkable given “we all walk in a very similar way… for efficiency,” says Dr Andy Kerr, an expert in human movement from Strathclyde University. Kerr is intrigued when I send him the clip of Dame and understands the furore over his outlier gait. “That young man’s walk is very unstable and jerky – normally you roll over your foot relatively smooth and elegant he was bouncing down.” He stays upright, Kerr believes, only “because he’s doing it fast”.If all this dancing, moving and straying outlandishly from the old school catwalk strut seems like a cynical ploy to generate a viral moment online, well, perhaps sometimes it is. But that doesn’t explain the hold it has recently taken over the industry. Take the Deveaux show, where a erse cast of models danced to a live rendition of Janet Jackson’s Love Will Never Do (Without You). “You can’t fake fun,” says Galloway of that show (again, his work), which brought more than one seasoned fashion journalist to tears. “It falls flat. And I am extremely sensitive to that because I’m a fun guy, I can find fun in a rock.”Part of the shift is down to who gets to be models. Buzzy, eco-minded brand Collina Strada cast friends and family in a show in which movement veered drastically from the norm – one model ran down the catwalk clutching an orange and wearing only pants, her body scribbled with environmental slogans. If you’re not a veteran industry insider, you might be free of some of the shackles generally imposed by it.According to Charlie Engman, who styled that show, “wider access to media and platforms of self-expression” are beginning to mean more inclusion. “There was the era of the supermodel, where walks had iniduality and power but upheld certain conventions of wealth, health, body type and a very specific idea of gender. Now, different experiences and bodies bring different walks.” In fact, this circles back to the freer catwalks of 80s London where club kids and designers’ friends modelled. The key difference now is dissemination through the internet.For Webb, who walked for the likes of Azzedine Alaïa and Karl Lagerfeld in the 90s and, after a hiatus, began walking in shows again a few years ago, this season was ripe with opportunities to emote. Tommy Hilfiger, where models danced down a Harlem catwalk as if they were at the block party the set had been made to look like, was “a real chance for me to express what it means to own your age, own your beauty and own your power.” While Deveaux was a chance to bring iniduality in a way “that has been out of style for runway struts for at least a decade. Best of all,” she says, “the model lineup looked like the world I really live in.”• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46938824e7cd5893e76553c30554221589f8f56/0_665_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=856fa8d3150aaf684f3894a8b7510624","title":"thomasina miers potato and leek soup recipe with nduja crumb","story":"A nourishing soup that freezes well for the days when you really don’t have time.

Sometimes this is just what the doctor ordered, but it is telling how even the smallest culinary act can make supper feel more nourishing perhaps the ultimate in looking after yourself.This soup is simplicity itself but can then be adapted and garnished a hundred different ways: here with spicy, garlicky crumbs.

Stir in the breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt, then fry for a minute or so until the crumbs have absorbed the fat set aside until ready to serve.When the potatoes are ready, use a hand blender to blitz the soup smooth. Check and adjust the seasoning, remembering that the crumbs will be salty. Scatter over the crumbs and serve at once.If you are vegetarian, try topping the soup with black olive crumbs or garlicky croutons instead.

Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200217-58536-gnl.fw.20200217.jf.jarsofurine.mp3 City have furiously rejected the conclusion, and suggestion that Etihad did not wholly fund the sponsorship, claiming that the CFCB’s two “chambers” were biased, “flawed,” had prejudged the outcome, and had ignored “irrefutable evidence.”The US aviation industry document was produced in 2015 by the “Partnership for Open and Fair Skies”, an alliance of three major US airlines and aviation staff unions. They were arguing to the US departments of commerce, transportation and state that Etihad was receiving enormous subsidies from the Abu Dhabi government, which, they claimed, distorted fair competition. The document refers to an internal report on Etihad prepared for the Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, by consultants in 2010, which was leaked in 2014 to the Australian Financial Review. The consultants noted, in reference to a list of Etihad’s sponsorships: “Executive Council covers Man City.”The Executive Council is in effect the Abu Dhabi governing body, and is chaired by the Crown Prince, who is widely considered the most powerful member of the ruling family. The senior business executive and political figure who was appointed to be City’s chairman after Mansour’s 2008 takeover, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, is a member of the Executive Council. He also chairs the Executive Affairs Authority, which advises on Abu Dhabi’s strategy and image, and works principally for the Crown Prince.Etihad denied that absolutely in their response to the US airlines’ allegations, submitted to the US departments in May 2015. The Abu Dhabi airline rejected the claim that its huge funding from the Abu Dhabi government represented “subsidies,” and said of the City deal: “The assertion that the Abu Dhabi government paid for Etihad’s sponsorship of English Premier League football club Manchester City is equally false. In 2011, Etihad and Manchester City entered into a 10-year sponsorship agreement, which included naming rights for Manchester City’s stadium. Etihad funded this sponsorship from its own liquidity. It is not uncommon for airlines to have sponsorships with sports teams and their venues.”Etihad did not refer in that response to the consultants’ review, or explain why the consultants had said “Executive Council covers Man City”.Following the publication of the internal City emails suggesting that Mansour’s own company was heavily subsidising the sponsorship, Etihad responded by saying in a statement: “Etihad Airways is proud to have been Manchester City FC’s main club partner since May 2009. The airline’s financial obligations, associated with the partnership of the club and the broader City Football Group, have always been, and remain, the sole liability and responsibility of Etihad Airways. This is reflected in the airline’s audited accounts.”The airline’s audited accounts are not published, but the US document published an apparent copy of the 2013-14 accounts which showed that Etihad had accumulated losses of $3.8bn, and had drawn down $5bn of loans from the Abu Dhabi government, which had also contributed a further $2.5bn in share capital. The accounts stated that Etihad had spent a total $150m during the year on advertising and promotion, although that was not itemised and the City sponsorship was not specifically referred to.City have denied throughout that Etihad’s sponsorship is subsidised, and said they are to appeal the Uefa CFCB conclusion and penalty to the court of arbitration for sport.

Leonardo is instilling discipline off it. And, for once, Neymar looks happy By Adam White and Eric Devin for Get French Football NewsPSG’s dumbfounding defeat to Manchester United in the last-16 of the Champions League last season was among the worst moments in the club’s 50-year history. There is fierce recent competition for that accolade, however, with the 6-1 defeat at Camp Nou in 2017 perhaps even more difficult to stomach. Things are looking better this time around though. As the club look forward to a last-16 tie with Borussia Dortmund, they are better placed than ever before to reach the promised land.Neymar’s birthday is probably circled in bold red pen on every PSG fan’s calendar. Every year since he arrived at the club his birthday party has been quite the event. The lavish, 300-guest, late-night affair – which usually arrives in the middle of a busy run of games – provides an opportunity for the often fragile relationships between PSG players, coaches and officials to become ever more strained, while also attracting criticism and unwanted attention.However, this year’s party became a positive story for PSG. Around midnight Neymar reportedly delivered a speech, saying: “For the first time, I am entirely happy in Paris,” and that he wants to “do everything I can alongside my teammates to win everything this year”. After the transfer tug-of-war between PSG and Barcelona last summer, when Neymar agitated for a move, the sighs of relief were practically audible outside the Parc des Princes.Neymar’s newfound contentment has been obvious on the pitch for some time. Despite an utterly ridiculous booking following an exchange of words with an official during PSG’s 5-0 win over Montpellier earlier this month, he has quietly (by his standards) gone about hitting his best and most consistent form since arriving in France in 2017.While Ángel Di María remains the hugely underappreciated creator-in-chief and Kylian Mbappé continues to attract his own headlines, Neymar, when fully fit, has been unstoppable. He has 11 goals and eight assists in his last 11 games and it is clear that genuine chemistry is developing between the “fab four” of Neymar, Mbappé, Di María and Mauro Icardi.The squad remains cliquey but Tuchel deserves credit for keeping his team together, both sportingly and socially. PSG are a far more tactically versatile, fluid and streetwise unit under the German than they ever were under Laurent Blanc or Unai Emery, who were both far less successful in asserting their authority over an unruly group.Leonardo – who returned as sporting director last summer – has played his part in achieving some relative calm. His remit extends well beyond recruitment and he has acted as something of a bad cop for Tuchel in issues of discipline, refusing to accept the previously rampant double standards, while also drawing media attention away from the coach and his squad.“I am going to speak to you in French. If some of you don’t understand me, all you have to do is take lessons.” Leonardo told the squad in July before publicly criticising Neymar for his late return to pre-season. “He was supposed to turn up and didn’t,” Leonardo told Le Parisien. “We are going to look at the measures we can take, like we would have done for all employees.” His deft handling of the Neymar-to-Barcelona saga was also crucial he played hardball with both the player and the Catalan club, while giving honest assessments of the ongoing situation in the press. Meanwhile, Neymar’s relationship with Tuchel and the rest of the squad remained intact, helping his eventual repatriation.Leonardo had left the same role back in 2013 under something of a cloud after a lengthy touchline ban following an altercation with a match official. After that PSG lost any semblance of a holistic approach to recruitment. Patrick Kluivert was a disaster as director of football – infamously not even recognising new signing Thomas Meunier when they shared a taxi together – and his successor, Antero Henrique, had a discordant relationship with Tuchel. Expensive transfer failures have been common. Grzegorz Krychowiak (€25m), Gonçalo Guedes (€30m), Thilo Kehrer (€37m), Jesé (€25m) Julian Draxler (up to €45m) and Leandro Paredes (€40m) have all flopped to varying degrees.Leonardo oversaw much of PSG’s initial rise under QSI ownership, with Thiago Silva and Zlatan Ibrahimovic being two of many marquee additions during his first spell. He is playing his part again this season. Leonardo has listened to Tuchel’s concerns about the balance of the squad and filled key gaps in defence and midfield. Abdou Diallo arrived from Borussia Dortmund to bolster the centre-back position Pablo Sarabia (10 goals in his last 13 games) joined from Sevilla and added versatility Keylor Navas is the experienced and consistent elite level goalkeeper the club have long needed and Idrissa Gueye has finally replaced Blaise Matuidi as a dynamic midfield presence.Improvements and problems aside, PSG are still PSG. The mental frailty that has characterised previous Champions League exits still lurks in the background and, as Mbappé’s touchline toy-throwing against Montpellier underlined, things still are not perfect. However, since the Manchester United defeat, Tuchel and Leonardo have quietly begun to mould a well-rounded, astute, harmonious and more committed squad, who are now better placed than ever to satisfy the club’s European obsession. Things might finally be coming together in Paris. Even Neymar is happy.• Yassine Benrahou was instrumental in midfield for Nîmes as they secured their fourth straight victory – a 1-0 win at home to Angers – and climbed out of the bottom three. Les Crocos have been sorely lacking a creative presence since Téji Savanier – the standout player in the league last season – joined Montpellier in the summer. Benrahou, who is on loan from Bordeaux, is just 21 and looks like a real prospect.• Toulouse are as good as down. They were beaten 2-0 by Nice on Saturday and had two players sent off in the process. The defeat – their 14th in their last 15 league games – leaves them 14 points from safety and 13 from the play-off place. Dijon occupy the play-off spot at the minute but it is tight – they are just four points behind Angers in 14th.• A much-weakened PSG side prepared for their Champions League showdown with Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday with an eight-goal thriller at Amiens. After being 3-0 down at half time, PSG roared back to take a 4-3 lead thanks to a brace from rapidly developing defensive midfielder-cum-centre-back Tanguy Kouassi. Serhou Guirassy rescued an important point for the hosts in injury time.• Lyon stumbled at home once more, drawing 1-1 with Strasbourg on Sunday afternoon. The visitors outplayed Lyon in the closing stages, hitting the post twice late on. Even though Lyon enjoyed the majority of possession, they could only muster five shots all game – the lowest they have achieved in the league since December 2016. Lyon are now 11th in Ligue 1 they have not been in the bottom half of the table at this stage of a season since 1997.• This is an article from Get French Football News• Follow Eric Devin, Adam White and GFFN on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ddf1f62130f6cde7a879a721a3d2f98bed2fb92/295_206_1369_822/master/1369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa8291b075e33f5895f543aed0b290c8","title":"can alexa help lower my screen time while keeping me connected","story":"With an Amazon Echo Dot at hand,  Alim Kheraj learns to break free of social media bad habitsI used to feel quite superior because of how little I relied on the tiny gods in our pockets – the devices that require so much time and devotion from everyone else. Then I started to get “screen time” notifications. This unwanted weekly intrusion was sobering: on average, I was using my phone for nearly four hours a day. And the bulk of that time was spent on social media.When I really thought about it, I could see how this came to be. Setting an alarm before bed turned into scrolling through Twitter for an hour checking the weather became a marathon Reddit session. All roads led back to social media, even if I’d picked up my phone with entirely different intentions.I was eager, then, to see if an Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa could change my behaviour. Reflecting on how I found myself inevitably in a social media hole whenever I used my phone, it felt logical that, if I could replace tasks I used my phone for with the smart speaker, I’d avoid wandering on to Twitter and ultimately prevent unnecessary phone time.When the Echo Dot arrived, I decided that the living room would be the best place for it. Setting it up was a doddle, although it did involve using my phone, but before long I had linked the speaker with my music streaming provider, my Audible account and had even saved recipes that I thought I might try during the week. That first evening – seduced by the allure of shiny new technology – I sat for two hours listening to podcasts on the sofa, my phone forgotten.Conscious that the Echo wasn’t there just to feed my true crime addiction, I scoped around to find out some other skills and tasks I could assign it. To prevent myself from waking up and looking up the news, weather and tube status on my phone, I decided to programme a morning routine – a set of Alexa’s commands triggered by a simple voice instruction. The next morning while having breakfast, I asked Alexa to “start my day”. First came a fact of the day, then the weather and finally the ’s news briefing, a 30-minute cut of the latest news, sport and reviews, read to you by Alexa.It was all very useful, but, being in a shared flat, having Alexa tell me the weather forecast out loud while my flatmate slept felt a little inconsiderate. And while I wish I had 30 minutes to spare to listen to a podcast each morning before leaving the house, it’s just not realistic. Like with any new addition to your home, Alexa and I needed to adjust.Diving back into the app, I reprogrammed my morning routine, replacing the news briefing with a mindfulness exercise. To get the news, I decided that I would use the  skill. The next morning, after being told that it was Britney Spears’s 38th birthday that day, I luxuriated in a minute’s worth of mindfulness, bathed in the soundscape of a forest, before asking Alexa to read me the headlines. When it was time to leave, I realised that I had only used my phone that morning to tweet a happy birthday to Ms Spears. Win.My phone use in the evening, however, was still a problem. Flatsharing means you have to be flexible, and arriving home after my flatmate I soon understood that it would be impossible to sit in the living room all night listening to audiobooks or podcasts or even doing Harry Potter trivia. I could hardly ask him to turn the TV off and vacate our shared space so I could listen to an episode of My Dad Wrote a Porno. So, the decision was made: I would take Alexa to my bedroom.Not only could I now set up alarms to wake me up, but I could also add little reminders each morning to water the plants or to not forget my phone charger before leaving the house without Alexa booming them out at 8am and freaking my housemate out. In the evenings, I found that I didn’t mind being holed up in my bedroom, as Alexa read me audiobooks and podcasts. As someone who needs background noise to sleep, I found that dozing off to a podcast was far more comfortable than wearing headphones in bed. I even added a sleep timer so that I didn’t miss anything when I eventually fell asleep.Most notable, though, was how easily using the Echo and Alexa replaced my phone. Sure, I was still drawn into the odd scour of Reddit and Twitter, but just asking Alexa to play me the latest episode of What Makes a Killer (yes, I know, not really light bedtime listening) instead of scoping it out on my phone before ultimately playing it while simultaneously bingeing on social media, meant I gave the podcast my full attention. I also didn’t fall asleep with my phone in my bed, either.It’s probably still too early to say that the Echo and Alexa have changed my life. But without doubt, it has shifted my behaviours. I make time in the mornings for mindfulness and engage properly, instead of just getting riled up by the latest scandal on Twitter. Mostly, though, it’s made me realise how much easier it is to find time in the day to take for yourself when you’re not sucked into hours scrolling on your phone. This week alone I’ve made my way through five hours of a new audiobook and my morning mindfulness is a revelation.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee642f6c562f83dafab00540528703f0da0fa8cb/0_216_1535_920/master/1535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=986f753312d3888bce1213002ff53bb7","title":"british ecj could sue eu eleanor sharpston","story":"Eleanor Sharpston, an advocate general, will replaced by a Greek candidate because of BrexitThe last British member of the European court of justice has said she could sue the EU over an attempt by the bloc’s 27 member states to force her out.Eleanor Sharpston, who is an advocate general to the court in Luxembourg, is set to be replaced by a Greek candidate because of Brexit.Asked whether she might take the EU to the court of justice over her removal, Sharpston said she was considering her case.“I have not made up my mind,” she told the Law Gazette. “It may be that the very last service I can render to my court is to see whether there is something I can do to push back against the member states intruding into the court’s autonomy and independence.”Shortly before the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, the member states stated that the mandates of all UK-related members of the bloc’s institutions would automatically end on 31 January.Sharpston, whose mandate will end in October 2021, has been told that she will only remain in post until her replacement has been appointed. The number of advocates general, who advise the court’s judges, remains fixed at 11.The EU member states’ position in relation to Sharpston’s tenure is said to be legally doubtful. The court’s statute states the mandate of a serving member can only be terminated for disciplinary reasons, by the court acting unanimously. Sharpston, a fellow of King’s College, Cambridge, and a former joint head of chambers in London, has been at the ECJ since 2006.The court’s British judge, Christopher Vajda, has already lost his seat despite the UK remaining within the single market and customs union until the end of 2020. There are 27 judges sitting on the ECJ – one for every member state.Vajda, who would otherwise have stayed a judge on the court until 2024, told the Law Gazette it was a pity the British government could not retain representation through the so-called transition period. “The UK had a very weak hand,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a5c98497787991807cfeec384847868575bb7b3/0_379_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a00185a7216d319bac7e7af5b4d4195","title":"all tindered out the surprising return of the singles night","story":"From naked dating to dirty Scrabble, singles nights and speed dating have been reinvented. Can these increasingly quirky events lead to lasting love?‘I used to torture frogs when I was young,” the man was telling me, with a stare that would make the most experienced serial killer uneasy. I wasn’t at a Halloween party. It was Friday night in London and I was attending my first singles event. When my friend suggested it, I had expected the evening to be awkward. I hadn’t expected to be nursing a glass of a wine while a stranger described the many brutal ways he had culled the north London amphibian population. After two hours of painful conversation with other guests, we eventually escaped, although not before our new friend leaned in for a bum grope.Yet despite people’s preconceptions, the dating app company hasn’t been deterred. It holds 55 events a year, including parties, skiing trips and bingo. The average number of party attendees doubled to more than 300 between 2018 and 2019, suggesting the events are more popular than ever.Meanwhile, more traditional event organisers are also seeing a rise in demand, with SpeedDater running 70 events a month across 23 cities in the UK. “We are trying to break down the stigma,” says Sarah Payne, the events manager at SpeedDater Events. “There used to be a big stigma about online dating but that has gone now. It is completely normal to meet online and we’d like to see the same thing happen with events. We do speed dating, but we also run parties, cooking classes and wine tasting.”As people develop “app-based dating fatigue”, singles events are making a comeback. “Apps are very appearance-based and events give people the chance to get a better idea of who a person is. People might be unsure about attending them, but then find they enjoy the face-to-face interaction.”Lynn, a 58-year-old life coach from Liverpool, turned to speed dating after becoming disillusioned with Tinder. “A few years ago, people were enthusiastic on apps and wanted to meet up, but that doesn’t seem to happen now,” she explains. “I tried speed dating, because it’s a faster version of apps and you get to meet lots of different people.” Although she hasn’t found any serious romantic prospects, she has had fun and made new friends. “You can’t take it too seriously or expect too much. You might have to meet a huge number of people to find someone you are actually compatible with.”Some dating companies are putting a spin on singles mixers with events such as naked speed dating or pheromone dating, where people can try to sniff their way to true love. For Alice, 28, a copywriter from Reading, these gimmicks can be fun, but they aren’t likely to lead to love. “I went naked speed dating because I thought it would be something different,” she explains. “Usually, women’s tickets for dating events sell out faster than the men’s tickets, but the opposite was true for this.”She chose to wear her underwear, although many people were naked. While she admits there was a novelty factor, it is not something she will repeat in a hurry. “There was a weird guy there and a woman told me he was touching himself during the event, which was uncomfortable. I think it might be a good way to meet people if you are into exhibitionism, but I’m not sure it was for me.”Alice is unconvinced that any type of speed dating leads to love. Instead, she prefers to attend general meet-up groups, where there is no pressure to look for a partner. “I think it’s better when things develop organically. Although some dating events have been OK, I tend to find the women are much more up for it and the men aren’t really people I’d go for.”The desire for organic interaction is something dating companies are aware of, and it has led to a surge in the number of activity events for singles. In 2017, Charlie Spokes set up her own dating business, My Friend Charlie, after a conversation with her mum sparked the idea. “She couldn’t understand why I wasn’t dating people I met in real life. Whenever I went out, I’d go for dinner, speak to friends and come home,” she explains. “I wanted to start something where people could meet up, enjoy an activity and actually talk to each other.” The company has run more than 150 quirky events across Manchester, London and Bristol, including sunset cycling, quizzes, darts and axe throwing.Paul, a 36-year-old IT consultant from Manchester, has attended several of Charlie’s events. “I gave up with online dating after putting lots of effort into my responses and getting no replies. So far, all the events I’ve tried have been good. You can talk about the activity you’re doing, which breaks the ice, especially if it’s something unusual.”He also believes you get a better picture of a person when you meet face-to-face. “You can’t hide behind a screen and pretend to be something you’re not. You have to be yourself.” Like Lynn he hasn’t found any dating prospects yet, but remains optimistic.In the past, dating apps, event companies and websites have come under fire for commoditising the search for love. Advertised by pearly toothed sex gods, they charge a heavy premium to find a “soulmate”. And although many websites and event organisers cite great success rates in uniting couples, ultimately they are businesses, not magic love machines. If everyone found their fairytale ending on the first attempt, profits would decline.Jordi Sinclair, who runs Smudged Lipstick Events, says it’s important to be honest about what you are selling. “We don’t promise anyone they will find love,” he explains. “We promise to put on great events, where you’ll meet new people and try something different. We have also found that it’s a misconception that all single people are desperately hunting for The One. Sometimes they want to meet other singles with similar interests, especially if lots of their friends are married.”As well as life drawing, Jenga dating and dirty Scrabble, the company runs an open mic night where people can come and share their dating war stories. “We put a lot of effort into choosing good venues and hosts. We also ban people from using phones to encourage interaction and get everyone talking.” While dating events are increasingly popular in big cities, there are fewer options available for older people and gay singles. “A lot of the experience-based meet-ups aren’t in my area,” explains Lynn. “For the over-50s, there isn’t much choice and there’s virtually nothing for people in their 60s and older. Dating is a numbers game, but that can be hard when there aren’t many options to meet people who are a similar age to you.”Andrew, 36, a London-based advertising specialist, says there is less variety for same-sex events, too. “I tried a gay-speed-dating event once, but I ended up getting really drunk. The only person I matched with was the man I met outside when I was smoking.” Likening the experience to “human scrolling”, he found the process artificial and awkward.However, he would be keen to try activity events if more existed for gay singles. “There are lots of meet-up groups for gay people, but I haven’t seen many fun same-sex events specifically for singles. I’d definitely like to see companies setting these up.” While SpeedDater already offers same-sex events, newer companies including My Friend Charlie and Smudged Lipstick Events are hoping to expand their offering to attract a wider range of people.As for me, I’m determined to put frog man behind me and keep an open mind. I might not meet The One, but there’s always wine, gin and throwing axes at strangers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba2385873a580fbe1f4e2e5ab47e0ffdbc0272c5/0_33_1436_862/master/1436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00b70aec7aa594b0189d31b83d4942a1","title":"how we met jenny and andrew bar vienna","story":"Jenny Jenkins-Pullen, 40, a clinical psychologist, and Andrew Pullen, 49, an academic coordinator, live in ViennaOne Saturday night, Andrew saw Jenny walk down the steps to the bar in Vienna where he worked. The other bartenders recognised her as a regular, but it was the first time Andrew had seen her. He had left his job as a lawyer, and was picking up shifts in an Irish pub, the now defunct Billy’s Bones. “We all tried to serve her first,” remembers Andrew. He got there first. She ordered cider and opened a tab.“She couldn’t see because there was a kind of lip under the bar and I wrote down ‘my future wife’ on the tab,” says Andrew. “All the other bartenders were like, dream on.”Maybe he wrote it “just to wind the guys up”, he says, “but I don’t feel that I did. It was a feeling of, ‘Wow, even in these short few minutes together, this is someone I want to spend more time and, ultimately, the rest of my life with.’”He had never felt like that before. Was it love at first sight? “Yes and no,” says Andrew. “I just had a feeling that this was an important person and something important was going to happen.”Jenny recalls that Andrew was “very charming” and thanks to a Welsh link – she is half-Welsh, half-German and Andrew is originally from Wales – “there was a bit of a connection straight away”.Did he spend the rest of the evening keeping an eye on her? He laughs. “Don’t make it sound so creepy. Yeah, of course. I think she had two or three ciders over the night. I kept looking over to see who she was with and looking at her drink to see if she needed another one.”He didn’t ask for Jenny’s number at closing time. “You knew I was going to come back,” she says. But he did slip her bar tab into his pocket after cashing up. “Something made me not throw it in the bin,” he says. “I took it home and put it in a drawer.”Soon afterwards, Jenny, who was a student, started work at the bar too. “We had shifts together and sometimes went out afterwards,” she says. “We used to hang out and go dancing or drinking with the other bartenders, or on our own. He used to walk me to the night bus.”They both had partners at the time and weren’t looking for anything else but, Andrew says, “We couldn’t deny it in the end. There are sausage stands in the city where you can buy hotdogs. I think we fell in love eating sausages in the middle of Vienna.”Jenny remembers becoming more aware of Andrew’s feelings as they walked together to the tram after leaving a nightclub. The sun was coming up and he implied he wanted more than friendship. “I felt nervous, in a nice way,” she says. “Butterflies.”Andrew was about to go to Spain for a few weeks, but they stayed in touch by email. “We expressed a lot of what we felt,” he says. “We both had the time to think about it and formulate what we wanted to say.”Back in Vienna, they went out on their first official date.Two years later, the couple moved in together and, eight years after meeting, got engaged on holiday in Thailand. “We were sitting next to each other on the beach, looking at the stars, looking out at the sea,” Jenny recalls. “He pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to me. I was like, what’s this? I opened it and it was that bar tab from eight years ago, and it said ‘my future wife’. I knew what was coming … but that was very emotional.”They married in 2010 and now have two daughters. Is Andrew amazed that he wrote his marriage into existence? He laughs. “I just wish I could do the same with the lottery numbers – to be so sure about something and have it pay off.”• Want to share your story?

But you’re still staring at the ceiling in the small hours. Here’s whyYou land in your body with a start, or else it slowly comes into groggy focus: either way it’s night-time, but you are now awake. Why? Alice Gregory, a psychology professor at Goldsmiths, University of London and the author of Nodding Off, says it’s quite normal to wake up during the night.After dropping off, we move through different stages of sleep, a cycle that takes the average adult about 90 minutes to complete and speeds up towards morning.“The night is also punctuated by brief awakenings,” says Gregory. “Typically, people return to sleep without realising that they had ever been awake.” But sometimes we might at least be more aware of it, or pulled entirely awake. Reasons range from the fairly obvious (being too hot or cold, needing the loo, having a nightmare, a crying baby) to the medical (disordered breathing such as sleep apnoea, or nocturia: excessive night-time urination).Waking up during the night does not necessarily mean you have insomnia, which, says Gregory, is diagnosed alongside other criteria such as the frequency of this occurrence and how long it has been happening. “If you find yourself waking regularly during the night, certainly flag this with your GP so they can consider any possible underlying causes.”Still, sleep deprivation takes its own toll, from irritability and reduced focus in the short term, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes. If you do find yourself regularly waking up without any apparent reason – what can you do about it?“It’s a misconception that we sleep the night through – nobody ever does,” says the sleep coach Katie Fischer. Waking as much as five or seven times a night is not necessarily a cause for concern – the most important thing is how you feel when you get up. “In the morning, do you feel refreshed, or groggy and unable to function, 30 minutes after waking?”If there is nothing to suggest an underlying medical issue, Fischer will look at the bigger picture with a patient. “It’s really important to know if they have children. Do they have a partner who snores, or works shifts?” she says. “They might not have their own sleep issues but they might be sleeping next to someone who does.”Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, even for people suffering from sleep apnoea (although that should be treated by a specialist). It is hackneyed to point the finger at caffeine, but people tend to underestimate how long its effects can last – Fischer says to stop consuming it by 2pm or 3pm. Water intake during the day is also a factor: “Even going to bed mildly dehydrated can disrupt our sleep.”Similarly, although people commonly turn to alcohol to help them fall asleep – Fischer says one in 10 use it as a sleep aid – it has a disruptive effect beyond the initial crash, causing spikes in blood sugar and cortisol levels. Diet can function in the same way, with “anti-sleep foods” that are high in sugar or cause flatulence or heartburn (such as broccoli and cabbage).A “pro-sleep” bedtime snack is a small amount of complex carbohydrates and protein, such as wholegrain cereal with milk, or toast with peanut butter, says Fischer. An “anti-inflammatory” diet favouring fruits, vegetables, lean protein, nuts, seeds and healthy fats (and limiting processed foods, red meats and alcohol) has been shown to improve sleep apnoea.As for exercise, although being active during the day aids sleep, anything strenuous is to be avoided before bedtime. A lot of advice for preventing night-time “awakenings” falls under the umbrella of what has come to be known as “good sleep hygiene”: restrict the bedroom to sleep and sex, ban screens emitting blue light, keep to regular bedtimes and so on.Our bedrooms – even our beds – have come to double as home cinemas, offices, “a dining room, maybe,” says the sleep consultant Maryanne Taylor. “You would be amazed at how significant that is for sleep. You’re training to associate your bed with wakefulness.” For that reason, if you do struggle to fall back asleep on waking up during the night, the advice is to get up for a bit. “Don’t just lie there – it’s counterproductive.”So, too, is looking at the clock, especially if it doubles as your phone. “As soon as your brain has registered that it’s 2am, you convince yourself that that’s your lot,” says Taylor. Such worry loops might be waking you up in the first place.For many of us, bedtime might be our first opportunity of the day to be alone with our thoughts, she says. “It’s connected to waking in the night because, if we haven’t had any processing time during the day, it’s the first time we stop and just be.” Managing stress and anxiety during waking hours and learning how to relax body and mind are key to a good night’s sleep – but ironically, fixating on getting your full eight hours can make it harder to achieve. “You get this awful self-fulfilling prophecy that’s quite hard to break,” says Fischer.A mindset change may be what’s needed. “People might have this belief that they are a ‘bad sleeper’ and there is nothing that they can do about it. Sometimes it’s about changing people’s perceptions of what good sleep looks like.” Taylor says she “really cannot bear” fitness trackers, which monitor sleep, for focusing people’s minds on often inaccurate data. It is wrong to assume that you must sleep through the night, every night, she says. “We all have blips in our sleep – it’s never going to be that you sleep brilliantly all the time.”But accepting that – even as you lie awake, hours before dawn – might be the first step towards it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7254b6c6fd2c10f6d43157c2a76d3a4338bc946/0_34_1824_1094/master/1824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ae6c49a63204d76f1d8404f7b558358","title":"the people who matchmake their own parents looking back it was a rash thing to do","story":"With the numbers of single over-50s growing, playing cupid for separated or bereaved parents can seem tempting. But there are potential pitfalls ...When he was widowed after almost 35 years of marriage, it seemed as if my dad might not find anyone else to love again. My mum was his first relationship, he had no experience of dating and, even if he had, the dating ecosystem had changed out of all recognition since the days of my parents’ romance in the 70s. There were, of course, plenty of dating apps, subscription sites, singles’ activities and old-fashioned blind dates to contend with, but for him the choice was overwhelming. He would rather have settled for being alone.Five years after my mum’s death, however, with our father’s stubborn reluctance well and truly established, my brother and I decided to take matters into our own hands. Taking advantage of the effects of the wine we had drunk for his birthday dinner, we downloaded Lumen – an app marketed as “Tinder for over-50s” – to his phone. Then we did an impromptu photoshoot and employed our best copywriting skills to sell him to the lucky ladies in a 10-mile vicinity.It took him a while to overcome the initial awkwardness of online messaging. He struggled to understand that most people prefer some informal chat before meeting up: he scared off some suitors by suggesting coffee straight away. After a few months of swiping, messaging and meeting up with strangers, he met someone who is now his partner.With the numbers of single over-50s growing in the UK, matchmaking for our parents is an increasingly likely prospect, and one that can be just as fraught as it is rewarding. For Jack (not his real name), the sudden death of his father in 2007 was devastating for him and his 58-year-old mother. “My mother suddenly found herself a widow, and since my dad was the love of her life, she was so lonely – and terrified at the idea of spending retirement on her own,” he says. “So I suggested internet dating, which was in its infancy at the time, but she wouldn’t contemplate it – she was too shy and I think she thought it may have been a bit vulgar, too.” Feeling helpless at the prospect of his mother’s solitary retirement, Jack decided to set up a page on a dating site without her knowing.“Looking back, it was a very rash thing to do,” he says. “I even set her age as a couple of years younger than she was because she has always looked young. But, just before I was going to launch the page, my girlfriend at the time persuaded me I had to come clean, and at least get my mum’s blessing.” There followed an awkward confession during which Jack persuaded his mum to give it a try for two months. “She went on a few dates, but didn’t meet anyone special and let her membership lapse,” he says. “That was until she checked back on her email alerts from the site and saw a photo of a widower, James, and decided to pay the £7 rejoining fee.”Jack was none the wiser until his mum introduced James to him as her boyfriend four months later. “I was shocked and elated,” he says. “They were clearly such a good match, and had hit it off after meeting up through the site. They ended up getting married in 2012, and my mum says that was the best £7 she ever spent. I’m glad I signed her up in the first place and that she was brave enough to take the plunge.”Julia Godoy’s parents had been separated for more than 10 years when, last summer, her 50-year-old mother decided to venture into the online dating world. “She was very close to a man, and they had a complicated relationship in which they were friends. But perhaps she hoped for more, and then in the summer she found out he was in a relationship and had been lying to her the whole time. She felt really betrayed and lost,” says Godoy. “But a friend of hers who is always on dating apps persuaded her to give it a try to help her move on and take back some control.”Godoy helped her mother, who was living in France, set up a profile on the French website Meetic, where she had paid for a three-month membership. Then they waited for the dates to start rolling in. “I was so surprised when she decided to sign up because my mum is usually shy and very private,” Godoy says. “But I’m glad she has taken that step.” Now two months into her subscription, her mum has been on a handful of dates. “She still feels awkward about it all, but I want her to keep trying,” she says. “It must all be very intimidating – even I have never signed up to any of the apps or sites – but all you can do is just be supportive to your parents and help them move on when they’re ready. I feel optimistic that she will meet someone soon – she deserves to.”Before internet dating was an option, Gillian Ross was matchmaking her widowed mother in a more traditional manner. In 1976, Ross, then 16, worked as a bookkeeper in an office where she met an older colleague, Derek. “I was hopeless at my job, and Derek was always so kind in offering to help me,” she says. “Sometimes, when I was walking home, he would see me and offer me a lift in his car and if we saw my mum walking back from her job at a nearby bacon factory, he’d stop to pick her up.” Initially assuming Derek was married because of the neat packed lunch he would bring into work each day, Ross found out that he was orced with two children, and encouraged her mum to set up a date with him.Ross says: “I was writing out Christmas cards that year, and I said to my mum: ‘Why don’t we send one to Derek and ask him to come for a drink on Boxing Day?’ But she was too embarrassed, and refused. She thought it would be too pushy.” Ross sent the card anyway, and when Derek replied saying he would love to come, the relationship began. “They started going out together every other weekend and getting to know each other – it was so nice to just see her happy with someone. My mum had a really rough time of it. My father died when I was seven and my brother not much older, so she was left with a massive responsibility. Then Derek came along and it was another lease of life for her – I think she’d given up before then.”The couple remained together for 38 years before Derek died of a brain tumour in 2015. “When Derek was dying, he took my hand and said: ‘Your mum gave me the happiest years of my life – I didn’t start living until I met her.’ They stayed as in love as when they had first met, and it was lovely to know that I had picked him out all those years ago. He really became a dad to me, too.”Ross is herself orced, and often finds her two children now trying to act as matchmaker for her. “People say to me: ‘Why don’t you go on Tinder?’ But I’m just not into it – I’d much rather meet people the old-fashioned way,” she says. “My kids have tried to set me up a couple of times because they would like to see me with someone again, but most of the decent men seem to be taken. If I don’t meet anyone, that’s fine by me, but, to be honest, I wish they would set me up more!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e460cabe205ee0b7a04f438880c42029253602/123_0_4684_2812/master/4684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c028194f426cd57626976192b11b85e7","title":"from ganafest to notte bianca your guide to maltas arts and culture festivals in 2020","story":"With events taking place across all seasons, there’s always a good time to visit MaltaThere’s always something happening in action-packed Malta.

Sources told the  that people such as the Any Questions presenter, Chris Mason, and the Today programme presenter Nick Robinson had also been approached.Stig Abell, the editor of the Times Literary Supplement who is coordinating the launch of the station, said he hoped Pienaar’s hiring would help make it a “new destination for those people hungry for quality reporting and trusted, expert analysis”.There has been disquiet in the BBC that the station’s launch is being coordinated by Abell, who is helping to poach many of the BBC’s leading presenters while still regularly presenting Radio 4’s flagship arts programme Front Row.The new station will be available on national DAB digital radio but will also try to take advantage of the rapid growth of smart speakers which are making it easier to try new stations.The BBC is under enormous pressure, both structurally and politically. Over the weekend the Murdoch-owned Sunday Times ran an anonymous Downing Street briefing which said the licence fee was under threat and that the government wanted to shut down or sell off every BBC radio station other than Radio 3 and Radio 4.Pienaar said: “It’s been a huge pleasure and a great privilege to work at the Beeb. Now, I couldn’t be more thrilled about joining the greatest and oldest title in journalism – in such a new and ambitious project on the digital frontline. The guiding aim is to offer listeners high-quality discussion and analysis of the stories and issues of the day, and make it a compelling, enjoyable listen.

The US and Canada have already introduced such measures, and the European Union announced in December it was looking at similar proposals.The aim is to target anyone throwing journalists in jail, or shutting down the internet. Whole countries will not be targeted, but iniduals, ministers, prosecutors and jailers. The chief sanction will be confiscation of assets and travel bans.It is a novel approach building on the so-called Magnitsky human rights sanctions first introduced in the US.“If world leaders are becoming more united and more innovative in finding ways to silence the press, shouldn’t we as defenders of the press do the same,” Clooney said.She acknowledged that the current state of global media suppression would make things difficult for the Foreign Office (FCO). Foreign governments, discovering their communications minister has been sanctioned, are hardly likely to rush to strike a trade deal with the UK.“We recognise diplomatically it could be awkward for a foreign minister in their first day in office to impose sanctions on scores of other ministers of foreign affairs due to human rights abuses,” she said.Clooney’s report has proposed ways to embolden ministers by protecting them from the likely diplomatic flak. Ending what has been described as “the silence of democracies” over media repression was more likely, she argued, if the democracies all spoke with one voice. “There is safety in numbers, so that is why this needs international sign-up,” something the FCO is seeking with its pledge on media freedom, which has been signed by more than 30 countries.Canada felt badly isolated when Saudi Arabia launched economic reprisals for Ottawa’s sanctions after the killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.The report suggested that UK ministers could be shielded from diplomatic fallout by the establishment of an independent national body that made objective recommendations on the most egregious cases of media repression. Clooney’s panel now wants to look at the consular assistance diplomats give threatened journalists, the possibility of emergency visas to rescue journalists at risk, requiring countries to open trials of reporters, and improving obligations on countries to be transparent about the arrest of journalists.Reports by the high-level panel are due this year on the improper curtailment of free speech via sedition laws, overly broad hate speech laws, anti-terrorism laws and the misuse of concepts such as fake news.Time will tell how far Raab is prepared to run with this campaign. “Autocrats hold dear control of the media,” Clooney said – and there are many modern autocrats in the world that would resent a western country telling them to un-muzzle their media.“All I can do as a human rights lawyer is keep trying to move an issue further up the to-do list and keep pushing so where a country is wavering they are more likely to do something than not. But yes, it is a pretty bleak landscape when it comes to accountability for human rights abuses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2118abd680c9036c91ec17934b3a16dbe7bb2209/0_177_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e8f52741e8dc2039df25cc296bfaa06","title":"womans day headline declaring meghan and harrys marriage over blatantly incorrect","story":"Australian Press Council says readers were misled and standards of accuracy were breachedA Woman’s Day cover story which said the royal family had confirmed Prince Harry and his wife Meghan’s marriage was over was “blatantly incorrect” and a breach of standards, even though gossip magazines are not held to the same factual standards as other media, the press watchdog has found.An issue of Woman’s Day published in May last year said on its cover: “Palace confirms the marriage is over! Why Harry was left with no choice but to end it”.The Australian Press Council has ruled that Woman’s Day, which is a member of the self-regulatory body, was in breach of standards for accuracy for the headline, which was not backed up by the article.Even allowing for the latitude given for factual exaggeration and inaccuracies in publications of this kind, the magazine had crossed a line, the council said.The magazine, published by Bauer Media, had to publish the adjudication in print and online on Monday.“While an entertainment publication can be expected to use some exaggeration, the headline was expressed as an unqualified fact that the palace had confirmed the marriage was over,” the council said.“The council considers that the statement in the headline was such that it was more than just an exaggeration, and that it was misleading.“The council acknowledges that celebrity and gossip magazines are purchased for light entertainment, with readers not necessarily assuming that everything presented is factual.”The publisher told the press council that neither the royal family nor the couple had complained about the article so it had not been corrected.On 8 January Harry and Meghan announced that they planned to step back from senior roles in the royal family, in part because of their unhappiness about living life in the public spotlight. They have launched several defamation actions against the British press.The Woman’s Day article used several anonymous sources and alleged the duchess had and “online relationship” with the British singer Matt Cardle.Meghan, who has consistently attracted negative press, was accused of being “absent from royal duties”.“ ‘Until now Harry has been giving Meghan the benefit of the doubt’, says our source,” the article said.“‘But he’s only willing to take so much and it’s reached the stage where enough is truly enough.’”Woman’s Day argued that magazines trading in gossip and celebrity had readers who understood it was “light entertainment” and it would be “unreasonable to hold such publications to a standard similar to that of other news media”.“Readers should expect a level of exaggeration and a complaint could be made about almost every gossip magazine,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee39c29cf48479db726581fde4d767e9e2506ed0/3152_2987_5362_3217/master/5362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61b53fe9f44667d819d4a9f5dbb23315","title":"the unwelcome revival of race science","story":"Its defenders claim to be standing up for uncomfortable truths, but race science is still as bogus as ever. By  Gavin EvansOne of the strangest ironies of our time is that a body of thoroughly debunked “science” is being revived by people who claim to be defending truth against a rising tide of ignorance. The idea that certain races are inherently more intelligent than others is being trumpeted by a small group of anthropologists, IQ researchers, psychologists and pundits who portray themselves as noble dissidents, standing up for inconvenient facts. Through a surprising mix of fringe and mainstream media sources, these ideas are reaching a new audience, which regards them as proof of the superiority of certain races.The claim that there is a link between race and intelligence is the main tenet of what is known as “race science” or, in many cases, “scientific racism”. Race scientists claim there are evolutionary bases for disparities in social outcomes – such as life expectancy, educational attainment, wealth, and incarceration rates – between racial groups. In particular, many of them argue that black people fare worse than white people because they tend to be less naturally intelligent.Although race science has been repeatedly debunked by scholarly research, in recent years it has made a comeback. Many of the keenest promoters of race science today are stars of the “alt-right”, who like to use pseudoscience to lend intellectual justification to ethno-nationalist politics. If you believe that poor people are poor because they are inherently less intelligent, then it is easy to leap to the conclusion that liberal remedies, such as affirmative action or foreign aid, are doomed to fail.There are scores of recent examples of rightwingers banging the drum for race science. In July 2016, for example, Steve Bannon, who was then Breitbart boss and would go on to be Donald Trump’s chief strategist, wrote an article in which he suggested that some black people who had been shot by the police might have deserved it. “There are, after all, in this world, some people who are naturally aggressive and violent,” Bannon wrote, evoking one of scientific racism’s ugliest contentions: that black people are more genetically predisposed to violence than others.One of the people behind the revival of race science was, not long ago, a mainstream figure. In 2014, Nicholas Wade, a former New York Times science correspondent, wrote what must rank as the most toxic book on race science to appear in the last 20 years. In A Troublesome Inheritance, he repeated three race-science shibboleths: that the notion of “race” corresponds to profound biological differences among groups of humans that human brains evolved differently from race to race and that this is supported by different racial averages in IQ scores.Wade’s book prompted 139 of the world’s leading population geneticists and evolutionary theorists to sign a letter in the New York Times accusing Wade of misappropriating research from their field, and several academics offered more detailed critiques. The University of Chicago geneticist Jerry Coyne described it as “simply bad science”. Yet some on the right have, perhaps unsurprisingly, latched on to Wade’s ideas, rebranding him as a paragon of intellectual honesty who had been silenced not by experts, but by political correctness.“That attack on my book was purely political,” Wade told Stefan Molyneux, one of the most popular promoters of the alt-right’s new scientific racism. They were speaking a month after Trump’s election on Molyneux’s YouTube show, whose episodes have been viewed tens of millions of times. Wade continued: “It had no scientific basis whatever and it showed the more ridiculous side of this herd belief.”Another of Molyneux’s recent guests was the political scientist Charles Murray, who co-authored The Bell Curve. The book argued that poor people, and particularly poor black people, were inherently less intelligent than white or Asian people. When it was first published in 1994, it became a New York Times bestseller, but over the next few years it was picked to pieces by academic critics.As a frequent target for protest on college campuses, Murray has become a figurehead for conservatives who want to portray progressives as unthinking hypocrites who have abandoned the principles of open discourse that underwrite a liberal society. And this logic has prompted some mainstream cultural figures to embrace Murray as an icon of scientific debate, or at least as an emblem of their own openness to the possibility that the truth can, at times, be uncomfortable. Last April, Murray appeared on the podcast of the popular nonfiction author Sam Harris. Murray used the platform to claim his liberal academic critics “lied without any apparent shadow of guilt because, I guess, in their own minds, they thought they were doing the Lord’s work.” (The podcast episode was entitled “Forbidden knowledge”.)In the past, race science has shaped not only political discourse, but also public policy. The year after The Bell Curve was published, in the lead-up to a Republican congress slashing benefits for poorer Americans, Murray gave expert testimony before a Senate committee on welfare reform more recently, congressman Paul Ryan, who helped push the Republicans’ latest tax cuts for the wealthy, has claimed Murray as an expert on poverty.Now, as race science leaches back into mainstream discourse, it has also been mainlined into the upper echelons of the US government through figures such as Bannon. The UK has not been spared this revival: the London Student newspaper recently exposed a semi-clandestine conference on intelligence and genetics held for the last three years at UCL without the university’s knowledge. One of the participants was the 88-year-old Ulster-based evolutionary psychologist Richard Lynn, who has described himself as a “scientific racist”.One of the reasons scientific racism hasn’t gone away is that the public hears more about the racism than it does about the science. This has left an opening for people such as Murray and Wade, in conjunction with their media boosters, to hold themselves up as humble defenders of rational enquiry. With so much focus on their apparent bias, we’ve done too little to discuss the science. Which raises the question: why, exactly, are the race scientists wrong?Race, like intelligence, is a notoriously slippery concept. Iniduals often share more genes with members of other races than with members of their own race. Indeed, many academics have argued that race is a social construct – which is not to deny that there are groups of people (“population groups”, in the scientific nomenclature) that share a high amount of genetic inheritance. Race science therefore starts out on treacherous scientific footing.The supposed science of race is at least as old as slavery and colonialism, and it was considered conventional wisdom in many western countries until 1945. Though it was rejected by a new generation of scholars and humanists after the Holocaust, it began to bubble up again in the 1970s, and has returned to mainstream discourse every so often since then.In apartheid South Africa, the idea that each race had its own character, personality traits and intellectual potential was part of the justification for the system of white rule. The subject of race and IQ was similarly politicised in the US, where Jensen’s paper was used to oppose welfare schemes, such as the Head Start programme, which were designed to lift children out of poverty. But the paper met with an immediate and overwhelmingly negative reaction – “an international firestorm,” the New York Times called it 43 years later, in Jensen’s obituary – especially on American university campuses, where academics issued dozens of rebuttals, and students burned him in effigy.The recent revival of ideas about race and IQ began with a seemingly benign scientific observation. In 2005, Steven Pinker, one of the world’s most prominent evolutionary psychologists, began promoting the view that Ashkenazi Jews are innately particularly intelligent – first in a lecture to a Jewish studies institute, then in a lengthy article in the liberal American magazine The New Republic the following year. This claim has long been the smiling face of race science if it is true that Jews are naturally more intelligent, then it’s only logical to say that others are naturally less so.The background to Pinker’s essay was a 2005 paper entitled “Natural history of Ashkenazi intelligence”, written by a trio of anthropologists at the University of Utah. In their 2005 paper, the anthropologists argued that high IQ scores among Ashkenazi Jews indicated that they evolved to be smarter than anyone else (including other groups of Jews).This evolutionary development supposedly took root between 800 and 1650 AD, when Ashkenazis, who primarily lived in Europe, were pushed by antisemitism into money-lending, which was stigmatised among Christians. This rapid evolution was possible, the paper argued, in part because the practice of not marrying outside the Jewish community meant a “very low inward gene flow”. This was also a factor behind the disproportionate prevalence in Ashkenazi Jews of genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs and Gaucher’s, which the researchers claimed were a byproduct of natural selection for higher intelligence those carrying the gene variants, or alleles, for these diseases were said to be smarter than the rest.Pinker followed this logic in his New Republic article, and elsewhere described the Ashkenazi paper as “thorough and well-argued”. He went on to castigate those who doubted the scientific value of talking about genetic differences between races, and claimed that “personality traits are measurable, heritable within a group and slightly different, on average, between groups”.In subsequent years, Nicholas Wade, Charles Murray, Richard Lynn, the increasingly popular Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson and others have all piled in on the Jewish intelligence thesis, using it as ballast for their views that different population groups inherit different mental capacities. Another member of this chorus is the journalist Andrew Sullivan, who was one of the loudest cheerleaders for The Bell Curve in 1994, featuring it prominently in The New Republic, which he edited at the time. He returned to the fray in 2011, using his popular blog, The Dish, to promote the view that population groups had different innate potentials when it came to intelligence.Sullivan noted that the differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews were “striking in the data”. It was a prime example of the rhetoric of race science, whose proponents love to claim that they are honouring the data, not political commitments. The far right has even rebranded race science with an alternative name that sounds like it was taken straight from the pages of a university course catalogue: “human bioersity”.A common theme in the rhetoric of race science is that its opponents are guilty of wishful thinking about the nature of human equality. “The IQ literature reveals that which no one would want to be the case,” Peterson told Molyneux on his YouTube show recently. Even the prominent social scientist Jonathan Haidt has criticised liberals as “IQ deniers”, who reject the truth of inherited IQ difference between groups because of a misguided commitment to the idea that social outcomes depend entirely on nurture, and are therefore mutable.Defenders of race science claim they are simply describing the facts as they are – and the truth isn’t always comfortable. “We remain the same species, just as a poodle and a beagle are of the same species,” Sullivan wrote in 2013. “But poodles, in general, are smarter than beagles, and beagles have a much better sense of smell.”The race “science” that has re-emerged into public discourse today – whether in the form of outright racism against black people, or supposedly friendlier claims of Ashkenazis’ superior intelligence – usually involves at least one of three claims, each of which has no grounding in scientific fact.The first claim is that when white Europeans’ Cro-Magnon ancestors arrived on the continent 45,000 years ago, they faced more trying conditions than in Africa. Greater environmental challenges led to the evolution of higher intelligence. Faced with the icy climate of the north, Richard Lynn wrote in 2006, “less intelligent iniduals and tribes would have died out, leaving as survivors the more intelligent”.Set aside for a moment the fact that agriculture, towns and alphabets first emerged in Mesopotamia, a region not known for its cold spells. There is ample scientific evidence of modern intelligence in prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa. In the past 15 years, cave finds along the South African Indian Ocean coastline have shown that, between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago, biologically modern humans were carefully blending paint by mixing ochre with bone-marrow fat and charcoal, fashioning beads for self-adornment, and making fish hooks, arrows and other sophisticated tools, sometimes by heating them to 315C (600F). Those studying the evidence, such as the South African archaeologist Christopher Henshilwood, argue that these were intelligent, creative people – just like us. As he put it: “We’re pushing back the date of symbolic thinking in modern humans – far, far back.”A second plank of the race science case goes like this: human bodies continued to evolve, at least until recently – with different groups developing different skin colours, predispositions to certain diseases, and things such as lactose tolerance. So why wouldn’t human brains continue evolving, too?The problem here is that race scientists are not comparing like with like. Most of these physical changes involve single gene mutations, which can spread throughout a population in a relatively short  of evolutionary time. By contrast, intelligence – even the rather specific version measured by IQ – involves a network of potentially thousands of genes, which probably takes at least 100 millennia to evolve appreciably.Given that so many genes, operating in different parts of the brain, contribute in some way to intelligence, it is hardly surprising that there is scant evidence of cognitive advance, at least over the last 100,000 years. The American palaeoanthropologist Ian Tattersall, widely acknowledged as one of the world’s leading experts on Cro-Magnons, has said that long before humans left Africa for Asia and Europe, they had already reached the end of the evolutionary line in terms of brain power. “We don’t have the right conditions for any meaningful biological evolution of the species,” he told an interviewer in 2000.In fact, when it comes to potential differences in intelligence between groups, one of the remarkable dimensions of the human genome is how little genetic variation there is. DNA research conducted in 1987 suggested a common, African ancestor for all humans alive today: “mitochondrial Eve”, who lived around 200,000 years ago. Because of this relatively recent (in evolutionary terms) common ancestry, human beings share a remarkably high proportion of their genes compared to other mammals. The single subspecies of chimpanzee that lives in central Africa, for example, has significantly more genetic variation than does the entire human race.No one has successfully isolated any genes “for” intelligence at all, and claims in this direction have turned to dust when subjected to peer review. As the Edinburgh University cognitive ageing specialist Prof Ian Deary put it, “It is difficult to name even one gene that is reliably associated with normal intelligence in young, healthy adults.” Intelligence doesn’t come neatly packaged and labelled on any single strand of DNA.Ultimately, race science depends on a third claim: that different IQ averages between population groups have a genetic basis. If this case falls, the whole edifice – from Ashkenazi exceptionalism to the supposed inevitability of black poverty – collapses with it.Before we can properly assess these claims, it is worth looking at the history of IQ testing. The public perception of IQ tests is that they provide a measure of unchanging intelligence, but when we look deeper, a very different picture emerges. Alfred Binet, the modest Frenchman who invented IQ testing in 1904, knew that intelligence was too complex to be expressed in a single number. “Intellectual qualities … cannot be measured as linear surfaces are measured,” he insisted, adding that giving IQ too much significance “may give place to illusions.”But Binet’s tests were embraced by Americans who assumed IQ was innate, and used it to inform immigration, segregationist and eugenic policies. Early IQ tests were packed with culturally loaded questions. (“The number of a Kaffir’s legs is: 2, 4, 6, 8?” was one of the questions in IQ tests given to US soldiers during the first world war.) Over time, the tests became less skewed and began to prove useful in measuring some forms of mental aptitude. But this tells us nothing about whether scores are mainly the product of genes or of environment. Further information is needed.One way to test this hypothesis would be to see if you can increase IQ by learning. If so, this would show that education levels, which are purely environmental, affect the scores. It is now well-known that if you practise IQ tests your score will rise, but other forms of study can also help. In 2008, Swiss researchers recruited 70 students and had half of them practise a memory-based computer game. All 35 of these students saw their IQs increase, and those who practised daily, for the full 19 weeks of the trial, showed the most improvement.Another way to establish the extent to which IQ is determined by nature rather than nurture would be to find identical twins separated at birth and subsequently raised in very different circumstances. But such cases are unusual, and some of the most influential research – such as the work of the 20th-century English psychologist Cyril Burt, who claimed to have shown that IQ was innate – has been dubious. (After Burt’s death, it was revealed that he had falsified much of his data.)A genuine twin study was launched by the Minneapolis-based psychologist Thomas Bouchard in 1979, and although he was generously backed by the overtly racist Pioneer Fund, his results make interesting reading. He studied identical twins, who have the same genes, but who were separated close to birth. This allowed him to consider the different contributions that environment and biology played in their development. His idea was that if the twins emerged with the same traits despite being raised in different environments, the main explanation would be genetic.The problem was that most of his identical twins were adopted into the same kinds of middle-class families. So it was hardly surprising that they ended up with similar IQs. In the relatively few cases where twins were adopted into families of different social classes and education levels, there ended up being huge disparities in IQ – in one case a 20-point gap in another, 29 points, or the difference between “dullness” and “superior intelligence” in the parlance of some IQ classifications. In other words, where the environments differed substantially, nurture seems to have been a far more powerful influence than nature on IQ.But what happens when you move from iniduals to whole populations? Could nature still have a role in influencing IQ averages? Perhaps the most significant IQ researcher of the last half century is the New Zealander Jim Flynn. IQ tests are calibrated so that the average IQ of all test subjects at any particular time is 100. In the 1990s, Flynn discovered that each generation of IQ tests had to be more challenging if this average was to be maintained. Projecting back 100 years, he found that average IQ scores measured by current standards would be about 70.Yet people have not changed genetically since then. Instead, Flynn noted, they have become more exposed to abstract logic, which is the sliver of intelligence that IQ tests measure. Some populations are more exposed to abstraction than others, which is why their average IQ scores differ. Flynn found that the different averages between populations were therefore entirely environmental.This finding has been reinforced by the changes in average IQ scores observed in some populations. The most rapid has been among Kenyan children – a rise of 26.3 points in the 14 years between 1984 and 1998, according to one study. The reason has nothing to do with genes. Instead, researchers found that, in the course of half a generation, nutrition, health and parental literacy had improved.So, what about the Ashkenazis? Since the 2005 University of Utah paper was published, DNA research by other scientists has shown that Ashkenazi Jews are far less genetically isolated than the paper argued. On the claims that Ashkenazi diseases were caused by rapid natural selection, further research has shown that they were caused by a random mutation. And there is no evidence that those carrying the gene variants for these diseases are any more or less intelligent than the rest of the community.But it was on IQ that the paper’s case really floundered. Tests conducted in the first two decades of the 20th century routinely showed Ashkenazi Jewish Americans scoring below average. For example, the IQ tests conducted on American soldiers during the first world war found Nordics scoring well above Jews. Carl Brigham, the Princeton professor who analysed the exam data, wrote: “Our figures … would rather tend to disprove the popular belief that the Jew is highly intelligent”. And yet, by the second world war, Jewish IQ scores were above average.A similar pattern could be seen from studies of two generations of Mizrahi Jewish children in Israel: the older generation had a mean IQ of 92.8, the younger of 101.3. And it wasn’t just a Jewish thing. Chinese Americans recorded average IQ scores of 97 in 1948, and 108.6 in 1990. And the gap between African Americans and white Americans narrowed by 5.5 points between 1972 and 2002.No one could reasonably claim that there had been genetic changes in the Jewish, Chinese American or African American populations in a generation or two. After reading the University of Utah paper, Harry Ostrer, who headed New York University’s human genetics programme, took the opposite view to Steven Pinker: “It’s bad science – not because it’s provocative, but because it’s bad genetics and bad epidemiology.”Ten years ago, our grasp of the actual science was firm enough for Craig Venter, the American biologist who led the private effort to decode the human genome, to respond to claims of a link between race and intelligence by declaring: “There is no basis in scientific fact or in the human genetic code for the notion that skin colour will be predictive of intelligence.”Yet race science maintains its hold on the imagination of the right, and today’s rightwing activists have learned some important lessons from past controversies. Using YouTube in particular, they attack the left-liberal media and academic establishment for its unwillingness to engage with the “facts”, and then employ race science as a political battering ram to push forward their small-state, anti-welfare, anti-foreign-aid agenda.These political goals have become ever more explicit. When interviewing Nicholas Wade, Stefan Molyneux argued that different social outcomes were the result of different innate IQs among the races – as he put it, high-IQ Ashkenazi Jews and low-IQ black people. Wade agreed, saying that the “role played by prejudice” in shaping black people’s social outcomes “is small and diminishing”, before condemning “wasted foreign aid” for African countries.Similarly, when Sam Harris, in his podcast interview with Charles Murray, pointed out the troubling fact that The Bell Curve was beloved by white supremacists and asked what the purpose of exploring race-based differences in intelligence was, Murray didn’t miss a beat. Its use, Murray said, came in countering policies, such as affirmative action in education and employment, based on the premise that “everybody is equal above the neck … whether it’s men or women or whether it’s ethnicities”.Race science isn’t going away any time soon. Its claims can only be countered by the slow, deliberate work of science and education. And they need to be – not only because of their potentially horrible human consequences, but because they are factually wrong. The problem is not, as the right would have it, that these ideas are under threat of censorship or stigmatisation because they are politically inconvenient. Race science is bad science. Or rather, it is not science at all.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d3acf286e52a5aabd485cb954622141b6ab642/0_1155_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b04f0375fe432844886c1ffd81b062be","title":"what is it like to come out late in life podcast","story":"Nicholas McInerny, a writer, came out as gay aged 45 and after nearly 20 years of marriage.

The study had MPs discuss particular experiences.Dawn Butler, who is standing to be Labour’s deputy leader, said she had once been removed from a room in parliament by police. “A police officer came to physically escort me out of the member’s tea room even though he was told I was a member of parliament,” the Brent Central MP said, adding that the officer later sent her a written apology.Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, told ITV that when she was pregnant a colleague had expressed surprise to be told Siddiq was having a daughter, as she thought people from Asian backgrounds were likely to abort girls.Siddiq said: “Speaking to a colleague of a mine, she looked at me in astonishment and said: ‘You know you’re having a girl, because normally they don’t tell people of Asian origin they’re having a girl because you know, then Asian people decide …’ And I looked at her and I couldn’t believe what she was saying.”Siddiq added that when she was first running for parliament someone advised her to use her husband’s surname, because “people wouldn’t vote for ‘Tulip Siddiq’”.Comments from MPs who asked to remain anonymous included one who said they had been spat at in the street because of their religion. Other said they had experienced racist comments while campaigning, as well as racist letters and emails.Afzal Khan, the Labour MP for Manchester Gorton, said: “You get loads of tweets saying: ‘You’re drumming on about Muslims.

The trip to India during parliamentary recess was to visit family and friends.She said: “Along with everyone else, I presented myself at the immigration desk with my documents including my e-visa, had my photograph taken and then the official looked at his screen and started shaking his head. Then he told me my visa was rejected, took my passport, and disappeared for about 10 minutes.“When he came back he was very rude and aggressive, shouting at me to ‘come with me’. I told him not to speak to me like that and was then taken to a cordoned-off area marked as a deportee cell. He then ordered me to sit down and I refused. I didn’t know what they might do or where else they may take me, so I wanted people to see me.”Abrahams arrived in Delhi with her aide Harpreet Uppal on an Emirates flight from Dubai at 9am on Monday.

At 29, she is thought to be the youngest cabinet secretary in the devolved administration’s 20-year history.With the SNP running a minority government, she now has to negotiate a deal with at least one other party to ensure the budget is passed on 5 March.Despite strong pressure to resign as an MSP, including from within the SNP, Mackay is reportedly preparing to return to Holyrood while the party considers his future.Sturgeon appointed Ben Macpherson, another rising star in the Scottish National party’s ranks, who became an MSP in 2016, as Forbes’s replacement as public finance minister, with responsibility for migration and climate policy.Another recent arrival, Jenny Gilruth, has been made minister of Europe and international development in her first government appointment.Gilruth will support Mike Russell, the veteran cabinet secretary for the constitution and European affairs, whose brief has been expanded to include external affairs.Fiona Hyslop, who has held ministerial posts since the SNP first won power in 2007, has been moved to become cabinet secretary for economy, fair work and culture, putting economic policy in the hands of two women for the first time.Fergus Ewing, another veteran SNP figure and a member of the Ewing political dynasty, has been given additional responsibility in the cabinet for tourism as well as being cabinet secretary for the rural economy.Sturgeon said the appointments meant seven out of her 12 cabinet members were women, with a fully gender-balanced government team.“These appointments bring new talent into government and deliver a real focus, not only on driving forward our economy, but also on addressing the challenges of Brexit, increasing our population and ending Scotland’s contribution to the climate crisis,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90529358f8e62e9060629170f8eb1eaf75fe6a71/0_101_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bffcc6dedb13b99e50937b57c96bd994","title":"opioid vending machine opens vancouver mysafe canada","story":"MySafe scheme for addicts aims to help reduce overdose deaths in Canadian cityA vending machine for powerful opioids has opened in Canada as part of a project to help fight the Canadian city’s overdose crisis.The MySafe project, which resembles a cash machine, gives addicts access to a prescribed amount of medical quality hydromorphone, a drug about twice as powerful as heroin.Dr Mark Tyndall, a professor of epidemiology at the University of British Columbia, came up with the project as part of an attempt to reduce the number of overdose deaths in the city, which reached 395 last year.“I think ethically we need to offer people a safer source,” he said. “So basically the idea is that instead of buying unknown fentanyl from an alley, we can get people pharmaceutical-grade drugs.”Don Durban, a social worker from Vancouver, is one of 14 opioid addicts using the MySafe vending machine. After being prescribed opioid-based painkillers in the early 2000s, the father of two developed an addiction and now feels unable to cope without a daily dose of hydromorphone.Unlike most addicts, Durban, 66, does not have to break the law by sourcing his fix through drug dealers. Instead he is prescribed Dilaudid – the brand name for hydromorphone – and, for the past couple of weeks, has been able to collect his pills from a vending machine near his home in Eastside, a rundown neighbourhood with a large homeless community.“This is a godsend,” he told the  during one of his visits to the machine. After verifying his identity with a biometric fingerprint scan, the machine dispensed Durban with three pills for each of his four daily visits, in line with his prescription.“It means I don’t have to go and buy iffy dope,” he said. “I have a clean supply. I don’t have to deal with other people so much. You’re treated like an adult, not some kind of demonic dope fiend. We’re just people with mental health issues.”Vancouver already has several schemes in place to accommodate for its large community of drug addicts. A pioneer of so-called harm reduction techniques, Vancouver was the first North American city to introduce a supervised injection site – where users can administer drugs in front of medical professionals – in 2003, and there are now several in the area. There are also programmes allowing users to access prescribed Dilaudid or pharmaceutical heroin.Tyndall believes his scheme, which he hopes to roll out in other cities, will help addicts by giving them more autonomy – allowing them to pick up supplies at their convenience without having to visit pharmacies at specific times.However, the MySafe project and Vancouver’s other harm-reduction techniques are not universally popular.Dr Mark Ujjainwalla, an addictions doctor who runs Recovery Ottawa in eastern Canada, says users of illegal drugs need treatment for their conditions rather than easier access to substances. He argues such schemes are in effect ushering users towards death, rather than treating curable conditions.“I’ve got people here who have changed their lives. They were in jail, prostituting, and they came to my clinic, we put them on methadone, they got their lives back, they’re working again. Isn’t that a better story?”Ujjainwalla also fears drugs distributed from machines such as MySafe could end up on the black market.Dr Ricky Bluthenthal, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, disagrees. “It’s always better for someone to use licitly produced, safe medication rather than illicitly produced or illicitly distributed substance, which often have contaminants and other things that are unhealthy for people,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1daa6b2e1573ff2b9c420cfa7c048681372a09c6/0_219_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13828cc3336fd6bc076d7d9418a99f0a","title":"do you have a job but struggle to make ends meet","story":"If you are working but your wages don’t cover your living costs, we’d like to hear from you.

England’s white-ball tour of South Africa had been billed as preparation, refinement, revision for the T20 World Cup in Australia. In the event it split neatly into two halves.The second of these was an adrenal three-stage drag race along the coast and back to the Highveld, and a series that suggested while England may or may not be the best Twenty20 team in the world they are surely the most entertaining, flaws and all.South Africa provided a wonderful staging. There were boisterous full houses. Cricket of various types filled out the TV channels and daily newspapers. Even in the glow of his match-winning knock on Sunday night Eoin Morgan took a moment to step outside the bubble and praise the warmth and youth of the host nation. The crowd at Buffalo Park, gleefully mixed as night fell over the grassy banks, was perhaps the enduring image of the tour.Around the same time rumours began to circulate, later confirmed, that Faf du Plessis has stepped down as South Africa’s Test and T20 captain. Du Plessis has been a fine servant, captain of his country in 112 games. But sport moves on and South African cricket will hope to evolve from here in all manner of ways.Before that the 50-over matches had coalesced into one slightly soggy entity. This was an one-day international series fulfilled as an obligation to the listings. Given the demands of all-format cricket, there was never going to be any sense of a victory lap.That team have now gone, or been mothballed. It might have felt a little odd for the home spectators, there to watch Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler but finding instead Sam Curran bringing the new-ball fire, Matt Parkinson and Joe Denly sending down some floaty twirlers. Look on our magnificence. For we are the champions.Lessons are in short supply. Saqib Mahmood bowled the most significant spell of the ODI series for England, five overs in Johannesburg that suggest he has the fire, skill and athleticism to develop as an international bowler. Parkinson needs to do a lot of bowling wherever he can, and also improve his fielding. Tom Banton looked entirely at ease at the Wanderers right up until the moment he got out just when he shouldn’t have.Ignition came in East London with the start of the T20 internationals. Suddenly there was significance to every turn as England seek to finesse their strongest 11. The evidence suggests there are only two spots left to fill.In Jofra Archer’s absence they lack an effective opening Powerplay bowler. England have gone for a lot of runs in that period over the past two years. So it proved to be in South Africa as Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma sparkled as an opening pair.Mark Wood had talked down his own credentials as a T20 bowler before the series – and he was as good as his word, going for 118 for four in his 10 overs. Chris Jordan showed he is a fine death bowler but less effective at the start. Tom Curran is England’s most skilful purveyor of variations and held his nerve very well in Durban. But he can also find himself plonked into the stratosphere when he gets that skiddy length wrong. Win or lose in Australia, it’s going to be a ride.Happily Archer’s return in place of Wood should fill that hole with a high-class specialist. The spinners are also “a lock”. Adil Rashid, still only 31 and apparently free of shoulder-knack, bowled with wonderful craft. Moeen Ali was reliable enough and batted with pyrotechnic grace.The second question to be settled is the identity of the final member of England’s top six. Had Dawid Malan been given three matches ahead of the Team England comfort blanket that is Denly he might have advanced his own case to be more than a reserve.There is an obvious move here. Tom Banton is a rare talent in T20 cricket. He’s ready to go. His introduction to this team would, though, highlight the one slightly wonky cog in that order. England are convinced Buttler should open. But an edgy 50 on a concrete road on the Highveld is clinching evidence of his undoubted talent as much as any suitability to face the new ball, which was called into question by 78 runs there in his previous four innings.If England’s T20 top six is ided into two blocks, starters and finishers, which side of this ide should Buttler realistically be on? Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow and Banton are the obvious bangers at the start. Morgan, Buttler and Stokes is an awesome-looking finishing block. This is England’s best batting lineup.It isn’t the one they’ll go with, though. England under Morgan have a habit of being stubborn over these things – and of being proved right, too. It is part of England’s tight team culture, the net gain from absolute certainty in their own methods.The logic of trying out some talented outsiders – Alex Hales as a batting option, David Willey as an effective Powerplay bowler – bumps up against this sense of a team that defines itself against the rest of the world. It can seem prissy, hostile to those who don’t fit, and tiresomely moralising in Hales’s case. But this is also England’s way of winning.A final conclusion from this white-ball tour: the Morgan supremacy continues. England’s captain has a natural authority. Success has given him a kind of power-halo, so much so that right now Morgan is the single most important person on the playing side of English cricket. Fully committed to the job, and with a sublime finisher’s innings behind him in Johannesburg, his authority is emphatically secure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1ab4179ece4ea32003d758ac654111d2af80d1e/0_40_677_407/master/677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10a471e220854c33c9eef50127637b04","title":"homeland the show that became a work of genius after you stopped watching","story":"As its final season kicks off, here’s how the terrorism thriller went from the Carrie-Brody chemistry show to the most unnervingly prescient TV of our timeAs Homeland began its eighth and final season on Sunday, there was a strong sense that it was ending at the right time. When it bows out on 26 March (3 May in the UK) it will be on its 96th episode. Eight seasons is a rare accomplishment for a scripted drama these days, and it’s amazing it has got this far. The show arrived in 2011 with a barnstorming first season that filled the gap left by 24.The premise was a doozy: missing marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), who had been presumed dead, is freed from years of imprisonment under terrorist Abu Nazir and returns home a hero. However, CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) sees the truth: Brody is a double agent, turned in captivity and primed for atrocity. As Carrie cried conspiracy, it was dismissed as the product of her bipolar disorder. Her condition was at once her superpower and her fatal flaw in her manic phase she spotted connections no other agent could, but she also saw things that weren’t there. The job she needed to survive was almost certainly going to kill her. It was the tightrope Danes walked each week, and it won her a Primetime Emmy and critical praise.Of course, it was a given that Carrie and Brody would write a bad romance. As brilliant, beautiful and broken as her, he matched her energy every time they faced off. A heady mix of betrayal and lust between mortal enemies developed. It didn’t hurt that Danes and Lewis had the kind of chemistry that can carry an entire series if it needs to. Once viewers are invested in a relationship, they are on the hook. The heavy lifting storytellers are accustomed to becomes light work.When a isive finale in season one caused consternation, viewers tuned in to see how these two patched things up. Of course, it eventually ended with Brody hanging from a giant crane in Iran. There would be no last-minute reprieve or glorious resurrection. Three seasons in, Homeland had slaughtered its beloved son. What direction would it take? Could Homeland survive without him?As it turned out, Homeland thrived. Carrie became the Drone Queen, the CIA’s youngest-ever station chief, carrying out her unique brand of car-bomb diplomacy with the relish of the true fanatic. While her relationship with father-figure Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) increasingly became the heart of the show, what was most impressive was how events on-screen mirrored real life. In the Berlin-set fifth season, it depicted an attempted terrorist attack on a European capital in the same timeframe as the November 2015 attacks in Paris. Then, season six opened with president-elect Elizabeth Keane at war with the intelligence community at the same time Donald Trump and the National Security establishment went to the mat in Washington.The eerie resonance continued with sock puppet-stuffed troll farms, foreshadowing Robert Mueller’s indictment of 13 Russians from the notorious Internet Research Agency and when the Kremlin co-opted “alt-right” goons for their own ends, Homeland had fake news master Yevgeny Gromov sowing discord. It was starting to get more than a bit spooky.These plots weren’t just blind luck. The annual conference of showrunners, stars, the intelligence community and state department officials has been crucial to the show’s prescience. The week-long event was a grounding in the state of affairs that Danes referred to as a “massive, terribly unnerving download about what’s really happening and what is likely to happen”. It allowed Homeland to stay ahead of the game and ensure that, particularly in its later seasons, there was no more relevant show on TV.None of which is to argue for a stay of execution. Eight seasons is an epic innings for a show that could easily have run out of ideas a lot earlier – 24’s more desperate episodes bear witness to that. Homeland deserves to go out on top. Apart from everything else, Carrie looks as if she could do with the break. Its greatest achievement was its reinvention as a commentary on the war on US enemies, foreign and domestic.

And imagine preparing for marriage – everything is ready and then the other side doesn’t show up, so let’s not speak about dates or months.”Rama was in Brussels attending an international conference to raise funds to rebuild homes and infrastructure, devastated by last November’s earthquake that killed 51 people in Albania. According to a study by Rama’s government and international agencies, the country will need €1.08bn (£900m) to help rebuild accommodation for at least 17,000 people left homeless after the 6.4-magnitude earthquake in the west of the country.Rama, who has been prime minister since 2013, said he had “no illusions or excessive expectations” about what could be raised from donors. Stressing “we will be very, very, very grateful” for whatever sum was reached, he added: “We have learnt the hard way we should not have excessive expectations from today’s EU.”Describing the EU’s decision to veto talks as a “political earthquake” one month before the real seismic event, he insisted his country had done everything necessary to start accession talks. But France, Denmark and the Netherlands were not convinced, rejecting a positive assessment from the European commission on Albania’s progress in tackling organised crime and starting judicial reforms.The commission has since vowed to overhaul the EU’s enlargement process to meet French concerns about countries backsliding on the rule of law. Rama said the new methodology “looks good”, adding that he had a “great relationship” with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, whom he praised for sending in troops to rescue people from the rubble.He said his country had become “collateral damage” because of “infights” inside the EU, citing the bloc’s difficulties with weak majorities, anti-European parties and populism.“It’s unfair, but it is what it is,” he said. “We are not in that process because we want to please people in Berlin or Paris or the Hague or wherever, but because we need it for our country or our children.”His country was countering “a very, very stingy history in terms of democracy and institutions”, having been isolated under communist rule as “the North Korea of Europe”, he said.He compared Albania’s parliament favourably with other democracies. “Looking at the British parliament while trying to do Brexit, looking at the American Congress and House, we are in good company I think. There are bigger and much more mature countries that have their own disruptions in their own parliaments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004c38e093af53e1cb3175e7f859247ccd0b1519/0_238_4977_2987/master/4977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de1fefddf3b5e4abd7767d1284bfdaff","title":"coronavirus japan braces for hundreds more cases as another china city locked down","story":"Evacuations begin despite continued quarantine as Japan warns outbreak ‘entering new phase’Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus onboard the stricken Princess Diamond cruise ship docked in Japan, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 454.Meanwhile concern is growing over possible infections among passengers from another cruise liner that docked in Cambodia last week. On Sunday a traveller from the MS Westerdam was confirmed to have the virus in Malaysia, days after disembarking along with hundreds of other passengers.It is not clear how many travellers remain in Cambodia and how many have already travelled on to further destinations. The Cambodian health ministry did not respond to requests for comment.The cruise operator, Holland America Line, told Reuters that guests who had left Cambodia would be “contacted by their local health department and be provided further information”. It is not clear if passengers will be asked to self-isolate once they return home. Hundreds of American passengers from the Diamond Princess, where travellers have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February, have been flown back to the US. Fourteen passengers tested positive during the evacuation, the US state department said.Australia said it would follow suit on Wednesday. Both countries have said citizens will face a further two weeks of quarantine after arriving home. Forty American passengers who were diagnosed with the virus have already been transferred to hospitals in Japan.Some Diamond Princess passengers still on the ship face another two weeks in isolation if they have shared a cabin with someone who tests positive.The total number of people infected around the world climbed to more than 71,000 on Monday, including a further 2,048 confirmed cases in China, where the total number of deaths stands at 1,770. Five people have died outside China. Of the 105 deaths reported in China on Monday, 100 were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak.Cities in Hubei have stepped up measures to stop the virus’s spread. The city of Xiaogan – which has a population of nearly 5 million people and the second highest number of confirmed cases in China – ordered residents to stay in their homes or face detention of up to 10 days. China also said it may postpone its annual congress in March – its biggest political meeting of the year – because of the outbreak. Japanese public health experts advising the government defended the decision to isolate passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess.With fresh cases emerging daily, the Japanese government has advised citizens to avoid mass gatherings. On Monday it cancelled celebrations for the emperor’s birthday, while organisers of the Tokyo marathon cancelled next month’s mass participation race, in which 38,000 people were due to take part.Omi said any disruption to this summer’s Tokyo Olympics – including possible cancellation of the Games – would depend on how and if the virus mutates in the coming months, as well as the effectiveness of the international community’s attempts to contain the outbreak.“Whether the virus is under control by the time of the Olympics is anyone’s guess,” he said at a media briefing in Tokyo.Omi conceded that tracing the chain of domestic transmissions not related to the Diamond Princes was proving difficult, but denied that Japan, which has confirmed 65 cases on land, was becoming a second major infection cluster.“Our focus now is on community-based preventive action to lower the speed of the transmission of the virus,” he said. “It is true that there have been silent transmissions, but Japan is certainly not in a state of pandemic.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.A hospital near Tokyo said it was no longer accepting new patients because one of its nurses had tested positive for the virus after treating an infected patient who later died.A member of the diagnosis team from Japan’s health ministry also tested positive for the disease, the ministry said. The virus’s spread in Japan has prompted calls for the government to speed up testing and offer clearer advice on when to seek medical help.Analysts warned of potentially “huge” damage to Japan’s economy, saying the widening fallout from the virus was damaging output and tourism, undermining growth and risking pushing the country into recession.There is concern, too, over the growing number of reported cases in Japan involving people who have not visited China recently or knowingly had direct contact with people arriving from the country.“We agreed that the present situation represents the early stage of a domestic outbreak. This could progress further,” said Takaji Wakita, the chief of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, after the first meeting of a taskforce at the prime minister’s office.Pressure on Japan’s health services increased again on Monday with the arrival in Tokyo of a government-chartered flight carrying 65 Japanese nationals from Wuhan, bringing the total number repatriated from the Chinese city to 763.Japan’s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, urged the public to avoid crowds and “non-essential gatherings”, including notoriously packed commuter trains, and said the country was “entering a new phase” in the outbreak of the virus.Koji Wada, a professor of public health at the International University of Health and Welfare, told the Asahi Shimbun: “There is the possibility that the infection may have spread to people well beyond the groups of patients who have been identified.”The government has made extra funds available for emergency countermeasures it says will be in place by the end of March. Employers in Japan are also starting to feel the effects of the outbreak. On Monday, Nippon  and Telephone, one of the country’s biggest firms, said it was urging its 200,000 group employees to work from home or stagger their commutes.Agencies contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b10317444a99b13801665ab2c2360fa09c6faa3/86_11_1754_1052/master/1754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=002d5b8eb9de662d88fcc91fa4616e22","title":"ghost ship mv alta washes ashore ireland year sea storm dennis","story":"Public warned away from MV Alta, which ran aground on Cork coast during Storm Dennis Abandoned by its crew, the cargo vessel made a lonely odyssey across the Atlantic, a ghost ship seemingly destined never to make port.The 77-metre MV Alta drifted for over a year, skirting the Americas, Africa and Europe, rusting and derelict yet resolutely afloat.Its voyage came to an end during Storm Dennis on Sunday when it ran aground near Ballycotton, a fishing village in County Cork, Ireland, overlooking the Celtic Sea. The Alta wedged itself on to rocks, apparently intact.On Monday experts from the local council, the Irish coastguard and Ireland’s commissioner of wrecks were discussing what to do with a visitor that was drawing lots of attention.“Cork county council is asking members of the public to stay away from the wreck location as it is situated on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and is in an unstable condition,” the council said in a statement.Environmental scientists who visited the area on Monday did not see visible pollution, the council said. It has asked a marine contractor to board the Alta – the next opportunity will be on Tuesday at around 7am, during low tide – for a closer inspection. “Any risk in relation to oil, other hazardous substances and pollution from the vessel will be evaluated.”Built in 1976, the Alta was flagged in Tanzania, changed owner in 2017 and was sailing from Greece to Haiti in September 2018 when it become disabled about 1,380 miles (2,220km) south-east of Bermuda.Unable to make repairs, the 10-strong crew was rescued by the US coastguard cutter Confidence, which brought the crew members to Puerto Rico. According to gCaptain, a maritime industry news site, the US coastguard contacted the ship’s owner to arrange a commercial tug to tow it to shore.It was reportedly towed to Guyana only to be hijacked, with its subsequent fate unclear until August 2019 when a Royal Navy ice patrol ship, HMS Protector, encountered it in the mid-Atlantic, apparently unmanned.It is thought to have later drifted up from Africa and past Spain to Ireland.In ocean lore, the story of the ghost ship the Flying Dutchman is a myth dating from the 1700s. The Mary Celeste, in contrast, was real: it was found abandoned, heading for the strait of Gibraltar in 1872, the crew’s fate a mystery.More recently, in 2006 the tanker Jian Seng was found off the coast of Queensland, Australia, without a crew, the identity of its owner and its origins unclear.In 2016 a wooden houseboat washed ashore on Ireland’s Atlantic coast. Made with driftwood and polystyrene and fitted with solar panels, it turned out to have been built by Rick Small, a Canadian environmentalist who had given the boat away and had no idea how it ended up crossing the ocean unmanned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ab467ee090ed88ecd77e858beb1ea692255259/476_311_4140_2486/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2acff6370363ce37ee48d86825c55c85","title":"river insects and lichens bucking trend of wildlife losses","story":"Reductions in air and water pollution are most likely reason, say scientistsFreshwater insects, mosses and lichens are bucking the trend of wildlife losses in the UK and have expanded their ranges since 1970, according to a new study. Reductions in air and water pollution are the most likely reason.Scientists say their new analysis shows that amid big declines in wildlife, action can help to reverse the trend for some species. The work analysed millions of sightings of 5,000 different invertebrate species by volunteers over 45 years.The scientists also said much wildlife had already been lost by 1970, which means that date is a low baseline. The pressures on invertebrate life, as well as better studied mammals and birds, include destruction of natural habitats, pollution and pesticides and, increasingly, the impacts of the climate crisis.“By looking at long-term trends in the distribution of understudied species, we found evidence of concerning declines but we also found that it’s not all bad news,” said Charlie Outhwaite at University College London, who led the new research.The new work, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, also shows that the ranges of many insect groups in the UK have declined since the mid-2000s. Other research has shown big falls in insect populations since that time, which was when neonicotinoid pesticides were introduced.“The trends in bees seen in this new study mirror the bee trends found in our 2019 research,” said Gary Powney, at the UK Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology, which was not part of the latest work. “The rapid and substantial decline in these pollinators in the late 2000s is a major cause for concern.”Other groups losing range in the new analysis included spiders and freshwater snails and mussels. The molluscs did not recover after 1994, Outhwaite said, “so something else is driving that change, potentially invasive species”. But fungus gnats and weevils showed strong expansion of their ranges.Determining the exact causes of changes is difficult, she said: “It’s challenging because you have multiple threats happening at the same time.”Prof Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new study, said data collected by volunteer recorders had to be treated carefully. “Recorder effort has greatly increased in recent years, along with the publication of new identification books, online guides, recording apps and so on,” he said. “Obviously the more you look, and the more experienced the recorder, the more you will find. The modelling purports to take this into account, but I do not see how.”The relationship between the range and abundance of species is not clear, Goulson said, although they would be expected to track one another. But the new work suggests range could expand for some species while their abundance falls. “All in all, it’s very puzzling,” he said.“This kind of data is very messy in terms of biases, like sampling effort over time,” said Outhwaite. “But the models are designed to try to take those into account, so they don’t influence our trends.”She also paid tribute to the volunteer recorders. “Our study demonstrates the power of citizen science, as anyone can contribute to impactful research. There are over 80 recording schemes in the UK now, so there is definitely something for you if you are interested.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4175776.1581946108!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus irish passengers trapped on cruise ship in japan set to be evacuated","story":"The coronavirus has now spread to 25 countries, and experts here regard it as highly likely it will arrive in Ireland at some point. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t US citizens wave from a bus as they leave the Diamond Princess cruise ship  in Yokohama on Sunday night. Photograph:  Franck RobichonEPAIrish passengers trapped on a cruise ship off Yokohama in Japan for the past fortnight because of the coronavirus are expected to be evacuated after the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was examining proposals for them.The United States on Sunday began taking its citizens off the Diamond Princess. Canada, Italy, South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong were also making plans for their citizens among the 3,700 passengers and crew.In response to queries about the possible evacuation of at least two Irish passengers, a department spokeswoman said: “We are working with other like-minded countries.”She added the Irish passengers, believed to be a couple from Co Meath, were receiving consular assistance. They were expected to face another two-week quarantine period once off the ship.The Japanese authorities had said the results of tests for the virus performed on everyone on board would be available by Friday, when staggered disembarkations could begin. However, the US authorities had begun to take about 400 of its citizens off the ship on Sunday.Some 355 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed among the ship’s passengers, including 70 on Sunday. All of the ill have been brought ashore to hospitals.About 420 cases of the virus have been officially recorded in Japan, including one fatality - making it host to the worst outbreak outside China. Japan’s government admits it is increasingly struggling to keep track of new infections. Five people, including a doctor and his wife, have come down with the virus at a hospital in Wakayama Prefecture, hundreds of kilometres from Yokohama. The government has revealed a cluster of eight new cases in Tokyo, most apparently infected by the same taxi driver.“Japan seems to have entered a new phase where the infection route of several new cases is unclear,” health minister Katsunobu Kato warned on Monday. The US was the first country to remove its citizens from the stricken liner. On Monday morning, about 340 Americans were flown by chartered flight to California and Texas, where they will be quarantined for two weeks at military bases. A total of 40 Americans have reportedly been infected on the ship. Some have been transferred to hospitals in Japan but 14 who have the virus but no symptoms were controversially allowed to fly home in what the US Department of State called a “specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft”.Matthew Smith, an American passenger who decided to stay on the Diamond Princess tweeted on Monday: “OMG: US Gov’t said they would not put anyone on planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus. Decision not to be evacuated  best decision ever.”The remaining passengers, most of whom are aged 60 or older, are scheduled to be released from quarantine in stages from Wednesday.Experts fear the Covid-19 crisis could begin to overwhelm Japanese medical facilities if it spreads. One hospital in the western suburbs of metropolitan Tokyo was forced to stop treating outpatients on Monday after a nurse fell ill. The nurse had been treating an elderly woman who died last week. The Japanese government is taking increasingly severe measures to keep the disease at bay. On Monday it cancelled public celebrations for the birthday of Emperor Naruhito later this week. Tokyo’s Marathon, which is scheduled for March 1st and expected to draw 38,000 runners, has also been curtailed.

File photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons The Unionism must wake up and realise that the old certainties are gone and that it is no longer a majority in Northern Ireland, former Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt said at Stormont at the launch of a new report on sectarianism.And it must become aware of the change in society, he said at the official publication of the report, Sectarianism: The Key Facts. The report was written by independent researcher Dr Robbie McVeigh and commissioned by the Equality Commission, a coalition of non-governmental agencies and trade unions promoting equality in Northern Ireland.Mr Nesbitt said there was a message for unionism from the current societal changes. “Wake up, the old certainties have gone. We are not a majority any more,” he said at the launch convened by public service union Unison and human rights organisation, the Committee on the Administration of Justice.He added that partition was designed to have a Protestant majority in the North and a Catholic majority in the South.“Those days are gone. People’s values, people’s priorities, people’s needs are very different today,” he added.“I encourage unionism to think about that, to think about the implications of where we are and to realise that Northern Ireland in 2020 is not about binaries any more we are much more complex than that.”‘Frog in hot water’Mr Nesbitt said he was reminded about the tale of the frog being placed in a pan of cold water which very slowly was brought to the boil and how the frog fails to realise the deadly danger he is in.“I think and fear that sometimes unionism is that frog,” he said. “We need to be aware how things are changing, and we need to stop disregarding the importance of human rights, and we need to think about how we tackle sectarianism.”One possible way was to have a single education system. He said if you raise children together from the age of three or four “you are giving them a virtual inoculation against sectarianism”.Sinn Féin junior Minister Declan Kearney said the Northern Executive was committed to tackling the “poison” of sectarianism. “Sectarianism remains endemic within northern society and in my view it is at the very crux of all our political, social and community isions,” he said.“Sectarianism isn’t some kind of abstract concept it is omnipresent. In many ways, it is our elephant in the room.” The 52-page report by Dr McVeigh addresses a range of issues such as changing demographics, shifts in the work force, the growth of the “other” group that does not identify as Protestant or Catholic, sectarian violence and criminal justice, housing, education and the Irish language.Dr McVeigh, referring to how Northern Ireland “soon” may have a Catholic majority, said that “Catholics may well discover what women have known for many years - namely that being in the majority does not necessarily guarantee any protection from discrimination and inequality”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4176333.1581952472!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"social democrats co leader considers run for ceann comhairle post","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKildare North TD Catherine Murphy’s potential move  indicates that the party, who now have six TDs, are likely to remain in Opposition.

Video: Irish Coast GuardA pollution control team has been deployed to east Cork after a ghost ship washed up onto rocks after drifting across the Atlantic over the last year.Locals in Ballycotton alerted the Irish Coast Guard Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Valentia at about 1.15pm when they spotted the freighter driven high on to rocks at Ballyandreane during Storm Dennis.According to the Coast Guard, the vessel is the MV Alta, a 77-metre freighter that has been derelict since the US coast guard rescued the 10-man crew from the vessel in October 2018.The ship had been en route from Greece to Haiti but became disabled and had been drifting for almost 20 days when the crew radioed for help after their food and water supplies began to run low.The crew was taken off the vessel about 2,220km southeast of Bermuda in October 2018 but since then the ship has continued to drift being driven eastwards by the prevailing winds.The Royal Navy ice patrol ship, HMS Protector came across the abandoned vessel off Africa on August 30th 2019 as it sailed towards the Bahamas to assist with hurricane relief efforts.The Royal Navy attempted to make contact with the ship but received no response and it now appears it continued to drift before coming to lodge on the rocks at Ballycotton.According to the Coast Guard, it is continuing to monitor the vessel amid fears it may pose a pollution risk from its fuel tanks if it breaks up on the rocks due to stormy seas.It is expected that the Coast Guard will be liaising closely with Cork County Council, the Port of Cork and the Commissioners of Irish Lights in the coming days to decide what to do with the ship.It is understood the Coast Guard will also be liaising with a number of international agencies to try and establish the ownership of the vessel, which was built in 1976 as a general cargo ship.The ship has been the subject of an ownership dispute in the past, with claims it was once hi-jacked and towed to Guyana, but efforts will be made to establish where it was last registered.Some reports suggest the MV Alta was sailing under a Panamanian flag when its crew were rescued and it was abandoned in October 2018 while other reports suggest it was registered in Tanzania.Meanwhile Cork County Council has convened its Oil Spill Assessment Team as part of its Oil Spill Contingency Plan in response to the grounding of the cargo ship in Ballycotton on Sunday afternoon.The council is currently liaising with the Irish Coastguard in relation to the pollution risk and with the Receiver of Wreck in relation to ownership of the vessel, the council confirmed in a statement.Cork County Council, which has responsibility for land based oil pollution risk, is continuing to monitor this ship in relation to any possible oil spillage or risk arising from cargo.The Council said it understands that the vessel was most likely diesel fuelled which poses less risk of pollution than heavy fuel oil but said it could not confirm the exact risk level at this time.The ship will be inspected in day light on Monday and from a land vantage point in order to access further the risk of the vessel breaking up and discharging its fuel into the sea at Ballycotton. The council is asking members of the public to stay away from the wreck area due the ship’s unstable condition."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Encouraging results reported from early findings as death toll heads towards 1,800Passengers will have to spend period of time at US military facilities for virus checksElderly Chinese tourist dies after falling ill on visit to Europe global toll rises above 1,500Some 500m Chinese affected by movement, travel restrictions to contain infectionsQuarantine ship treads water as prestige and fear interact ahead of Japan\u0026rsquos July gamesHundreds of infections reported worldwide but only two deaths outside mainland ChinaProject believed to be New Zealand\u0026rsquos largest mass relocation of a bird colonyVirus named Covid-19 at two-day meeting of World Health Organisation in GenevaDeath of whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang sparked uproar on Chinese social media platformsOpposition AAP on course for more than 60 seats after bitterly isive campaignOther countries advised to consider adopting China-style containment measuresCases outside China \u0026lsquocould be the spark that becomes a bigger fire\u0026rsquo, WHO chief warnsHospitals overwhelmed by epidemic turn away sick residents like the Zhang familyTV presenter apologises for screaming when Bong Joon-ho\u0026rsquos film named best pictureFour-day downpour on Australia\u0026rsquos east coast brings relief after bushfires and droughtUK confirms fourth case of coronavirusGunman posted video on Facebook Live of shooting rampage in shopping mallDr Jiang Yangyong\u0026rsquos fate under spotlight in wake of coronavirus whistleblower\u0026rsquos deathAuthorities extend Lunar New Year holidays with more than 811 people killedMore than 50 others injured near shopping centre in country\u0026rsquos worst mass shooting"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Storm Dennis: River levels in Hereford reach record high as death toll reaches fourCoronavirus latest news: Britons stuck on quarantined ship to be flown homeSign up to the \u0026#39s Politics WhatsApp group for the latest Brexit news and daily updates from WestminsterFar-Right German terror cell was \u0026#39planning attacks on ten mosques\u0026#39Man, 38, charged with 1994 murder of Rikki Neave Coronavirus: Holiday Inn at Heathrow to be used as emergency quarantine centre Archaeologists discover sarcophagus linked to cult of Romulus, fabled founder of RomeSurvivor of Magdalene home for unmarried mothers in Ireland takes case to UN torture committee in landmark casePolitics Latest News: Boris Johnson under pressure to cut ties with Huawei after Donald Trump warned US could stop intelligence sharing Secretary stole £1.2m from property tycoon boss to buy herself sports cars, court hears as she is spared jailAmazon Prime show Outlander fueling theft from historic sites in ScotlandOliver Cromwell letter in which he talks about his depression put on display for the timeComment: Can Bernie Sanders really break the curse of Corbynism?State-of-the-art moveable road barrier to keep Kent’s motorways movingArmed gang steals lavatory rolls as panic-buying hits Hong KongComment: Rishi Sunak needn\u0026#39t be a \u0026#39Chancellor in Name Only\u0026#39 for longMilitary veteran first person to get 3D-printed \u0026#39hero arm\u0026#39 on NHSFirst carbon and plastic neutral food product developed by British farmerSurge in virus cases sparks more fear on Diamond Princess cruise shipLove Island to pay tribute to Caroline Flack as ITV faces calls for show to be cancelledWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2019/07/11/TELEMMGLPICT000201862214_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=45","title":"reality tv recklessly blurs line public private","story":"Shows like ‘Love Island’ invite us to judge strangers – sometimes forgetting they are human beings, tooCaroline Flack, the former host of Love Island, has taken her own life at the age of 40. I’m sensitive about the age because it is not far off my own, and there seems so much to live for, especially when you are as beautiful and loved as Caroline was. Her boyfriend has said: “My heart is broken.”I used to review Love Island for the Catholic Herald (not its natural audience) and I compared the show to a wildlife documentary: here was nature in tooth and claw, and it obviously had some animal magic because it became a big hit. Then two of its former contestants took their own lives, triggering a debate about the dangers of reality television. Had the format taken a bad turn? Was it too intrusive, too intense?No, it had just reached its logical conclusion. Love Island is not about the commodification of sex (there is barely any in it), it’s about the commodification of everyday life, and the problem with reality television is that it has blurred to the point of erasure the necessary line between public and private. In most careers, you do the job, you go home, the job stops. In reality television, the job is being you. You go home and you are still you, so the job goes on and on. There is nowhere to hide. You are trapped in a cycle of publicity. You do well, you become famous. You make a mistake, people talk about it. You get depressed and stop going out, people talk about that too.Television and social media have taken the place of God as the all-seeing eye, except that God balances judgment with mercy, whereas humans tend just to judge. Caroline had talked bravely about her mental health in the past and was facing trial for the alleged assault of her boyfriend, a case that he insisted was completely unnecessary. Either way, it was none of our business. But what little people felt they knew about Caroline made her a target for comment, almost up to the moment that her death was announced.Time, now, for thoughts and prayers, which are welcomed and treasured, no doubt – but, as Caroline’s fans have pointed out, some of them have been sent from those who make money out of criticising others and perhaps don’t think hard enough before they do it. I know I don’t. It is something I need to work on. Suicide is a desperately private and lonely act. In the absence of information, we leap to judgment: blame the tabloids, blame the haters, blame Love Island. But from what I can make out, Caroline liked her job and was good at it because people liked her. She was everybody’s big sister.It is easy to dismiss television personalities because it looks like they are coasting on just being themselves, but actually a lot of work and talent goes into being a human being. If it were easy, the world would be a much nicer place.  The Samaritans are available 24 hours a day, at samaritans.org or on 116 123Former police officer Harry Miller outside the Royal Courts of JusticeI would love to declare the Harry Miller trial a victory for free speech but, having read the full judgment, I can see we are not there yet.Mr Miller, to recap, was publicly critical of transgenderism and accused of a “non-crime hate incident”. This earned him a visit from a copper who gave Mr Miller the impression that he might face prosecution if he continued to speak out.The High Court declared the police probe misleading and unlawful and made some scathing comparisons with Nineteen Eighty-Four, but the judge actually defended the police’s policy on the recording of non-crimes even though they are the very guidelines the Pc thought he was trying to uphold. In other words, this ruling was about procedure, not policy.The judge permitted Mr Miller to take the policy to the Supreme Court, and good luck to him because it is flawed on two counts. First, it’s incredibly subjective: the police define a hate incident as that which is “perceived by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice”.The complainant “does \u2028not have to provide evidence or justify their belief”. Second, if no crime has been committed, all the police can do is spend precious time recording \u2028them – and in this instance, the officer says he was only trying to gather \u2028 some facts, perhaps unaware that all contact with the fuzz is inherently intimidating.I am convinced the guidelines are open-ended precisely to have a chilling effect on speech. The state does not want to lock up everyone who says something controversial – that would be a logistical and legal nightmare – so it is much easier to signal to society that the police might take an interest if we cross a line that no one can possibly define. The result? We won’t say anything. Just in case. The Pc disputes Mr Miller’s account of their conversation but, if it is true, it is a revelation about police culture. According to Mr Miller, the officer tried to explain how transgenderism works, saying: “You have to understand, sometimes in the womb, a female brain gets confused and pushes out the wrong body parts, and that is what transgender is.” Mr Miller said: “You’ve got to be kidding me. Wrong body parts?... Is this really the official police line?” He said the officer replied: “Yes, I have been on a course.”Storm Dennis: River levels in Hereford reach record high as death toll reaches fourCoronavirus latest news: Britons stuck on quarantined ship to be flown homeSign up to the \u0026#39s Politics WhatsApp group for the latest Brexit news and daily updates from WestminsterFar-Right German terror cell was \u0026#39planning attacks on ten mosques\u0026#39Man, 38, charged with 1994 murder of Rikki Neave Coronavirus: Holiday Inn at Heathrow to be used as emergency quarantine centre Archaeologists discover sarcophagus linked to cult of Romulus, fabled founder of RomeSurvivor of Magdalene home for unmarried mothers in Ireland takes case to UN torture committee in landmark casePolitics Latest News: Boris Johnson under pressure to cut ties with Huawei after Donald Trump warned US could stop intelligence sharing Secretary stole £1.2m from property tycoon boss to buy herself sports cars, court hears as she is spared jailAmazon Prime show Outlander fueling theft from historic sites in ScotlandOliver Cromwell letter in which he talks about his depression put on display for the timeComment: Can Bernie Sanders really break the curse of Corbynism?State-of-the-art moveable road barrier to keep Kent’s motorways movingArmed gang steals lavatory rolls as panic-buying hits Hong KongComment: Rishi Sunak needn\u0026#39t be a \u0026#39Chancellor in Name Only\u0026#39 for longMilitary veteran first person to get 3D-printed \u0026#39hero arm\u0026#39 on NHSFirst carbon and plastic neutral food product developed by British farmerSurge in virus cases sparks more fear on Diamond Princess cruise shipLove Island to pay tribute to Caroline Flack as ITV faces calls for show to be cancelledWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"shamima begum says whole world fell apart losing citizenship","story":"Shamima Begum said her whole world fell apart when she lost the first stage of her appeal against losing her British citizenship.Appearing for the first time without her black burka, in line with deradicalisation efforts in Roj, a camp managed by Western-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, \u0027Isil bride\u0027 runaway Begum told ABC News: I kind of saw it coming because I did my research.I thought it would be a bit different because I had not done anything wrong before I came to Isis.The Bethnal Green schoolgirl left the UK when she was 15 with two other friends, marrying a Dutch fighter with whom she had three children while living under the rule of the terror group.The 20-year-old was found, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp in February last year - a re-emergence that prompted the then Home Secretary to strip her of her citizenship.Asked about her previous comments to the Times where she appeared unrepentant after being found in Al-Hawl camp after fleeing the village of Baghuz, she said she was afraid for my life.Wearing a maroon head scarf, jeans and a diamante nose stud, she said: I had just come into the camp. I had just given birth. I was hearing all these stories about women threatening other women, you know, folk uncovering their faces or speaking to men or doing interviews, or anything like that.I just was afraid for my life.Ms Begum’s lawyers have argued the decision to strip her of citizenship was unlawful as it rendered her stateless. Such a decision is lawful only if an inidual is entitled to citizenship of another country.Last year, Ms Begum took legal action against the Home Office at the High Court and the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), a specialist tribunal which hears challenges to decisions to remove someone\u0027s British citizenship on national security grounds.The tribunal, led by SIAC president Mrs Justice Elisabeth Laing, found in a judgment earlier this month the decision by Sajid Javid “did not make her stateless”. It also concluded the move did not breach her human rights by exposing her to a risk of torture or death.On the final preliminary ground for appeal - that Ms Begum was unable to have a fair and effective appeal outside the UK - the judgment said: “We accept that Ms Begum cannot have an effective appeal in the current circumstances but it doesn’t follow that her appeal succeeds.”Ms Begum now has the opportunity to appeal against the decision and, if that fails, the court will be asked to consider further issues, such as national security concerns. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/14/12/BP-oil-rig.jpg","title":"climate change greenwashing bp net zero 2050 advertising","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.BP’s aim of achieving net zero emissions has rightly been criticised for lacking substance, but its commitment to stop misleading adverts about its impact on the climate is a welcome start – it must be held to account on this, writes Ben ChapmanBuried a couple of thousand words beneath BP’s eye-catching announcement that it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 was an important promise that garnered much less attention.The oil company said it would stop funding “corporate reputation advertising” which, in the context of the oil and gas industry, is more commonly known as greenwash.This means BP will end its multimillion-pound “Possibilities Everywhere” campaign, which touted the company’s questionable green credentials. That’s a fairly rapid u-turn, given that the global campaign was only launched last year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesPerhaps BP has realised the futility of spending large sums highlighting the tiny part of its business that generates renewable energy when the company remains synonymous with fossil fuels.\u0026nbspAdverts on billboards, newspapers and television in the UK, US and Europe as well as on social media and online\u0026nbsppictured\u0026nbspgreen fields and windmills alongside phrases like, “working to make energy cleaner”. The ads missed out the fact that\u0026nbsp96 per cent of BP’s capital expenditure is on oil and gas.Thanks in part to the efforts of groups like environmental lawyers ClientEarth which launched a complaint against over the campaign, the company has been held to account.Two decades – and billions of barrels of oil – since BP had the chutzpah to relaunch itself as “beyond petroleum”, people have seen through the facade.“In future, any corporate advertising will be to push for progressive climate policy communicate our net zero ambition invite ideas or build collaboration,” BP said.This statement, unlike the target to go carbon neutral by 2050, can be scrutinised immediately and it will be. I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too. Earlier this month Ryanair was banned from claiming that it was Europe’s “lowest CO2 emissions airline”. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the statement couldn’t be backed up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BP sets target to achieve net zero by 2050 to tackle climate emergencyThe climate crisis is real, but Boris Johnson still ‘doesn’t get it’Boris Johnson forces out UK president of climate change summitAnyone can make a complaint to the ASA about an issue like an misleading environmental claim, it just requires filling out a few boxes on an online form.If this action does not stop airlines and oil companies producing dodgy ads on climate change, sterner laws must be enforced. ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I am not sure if they were trolling me but both (not being a party to my pledge) in particular asked me to buy these items for them.Okay, I also bought myself a vintage shirt, non-plastic food covers to replace cling film with and cotton face pads to cleanse the face without the need for additional products.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m changing my spending habits to help save the planetApart from the vintage shirt these latter purchases are also part of my new outlook on the things I consume: considering materials used in production the use they have and what happens once they become waste.From trying my best to avoid buying lunch wrapped in plastic to opting for plastic free cosmetics, I am trying to progressively reduce my waste.My phone is 20 months old and previously that would mean I would be ready to buy the new shiny phone with the improved camera. Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

Floating masses of garbage offshore from some of the Caribbean\u0027s pristine beaches are testimony to a vast and growing problem of plastic pollution heedlessly dumped in our oceans,  locals, activists and experts say.A man climbs down to a garbage filled river in Manila. Plastic rubbish will outweigh fish in the oceans by 2050 unless the world takes drastic action to recycle the material, a report warned in 2016.Garbage on East Beach, Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands), in the south Pacific Ocean. The uninhabited island has been found to have the world\u0027s highest density of waste plastic, with more than 3,500 additional pieces of litter washing ashore daily at just one of its beaches. This is also why I am keeping a close eye on the experience of all my fellow pledgers. How can I avoid using plastic further? Can I plan my next holiday by train travel? What local produce can I opt for instead of fruit flown in from thousands of miles away? Can I start growing my own parsley and spring onion (my parents have an annual supply of potatoes from their allotment, maybe I have learnt a thing or two from them)?Modern day consumerism (i.e. capitalism) fuels our desire to have more and more. We are somehow convinced we need all this stuff. The planet is at the desperate point where we need to convince ourselves that we actually do not.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible.

People seem genuinely interested in the challenge I’ve set myself\u0026nbsp– but I’ve quickly learnt\u0026nbspthat while they initially want to listen to what I have to say, it doesn’t last very long.I can spot the exact moment where people switch off –\u0026nbspusually when I mention what my favourite type of tofu is or the perils of trying to make jackfruit taste like anything other than cardboard. It isn’t upsetting, but it’s a moment of realisation. It’s like going into work first thing on a Monday morning and asking someone how their weekend was you’re really just\u0026nbspdoing it out of politeness – let’s be honest, you don’t really care.One of the biggest worries I had about going vegan was that I would become the annoying person everyone has to accommodate for: you’re going to a restaurant, do they have vegan options? Nope, can’t go there.I’d like to think I’m quite a self-aware person. I know when I’m being annoying, or when people feel a certain type of way towards me.But whether I like it or not – and whether my friends, work colleagues or the people around me do too – turning vegan is (sadly) the most interesting thing about my life right now. It’s the biggest change to my life for as long as I can remember. The dramatics of this might seem high so read with a pinch of salt and don’t take it too seriously.Here’s my sub-pledge: I’m going to try and keep my conversations about veganism short and sweet. People are interested in what you have to say but not for too long.\u0026nbspHow do you know if someone is a vegan?

Scientists hope that citizen scientists will be able to find interesting things in the data – whether that is unknown natural phenomena, or something even more unexpected, such as alien life.“Since Breakthrough Listen’s initial data release last year, we have doubled what is available to the public,” said Breakthrough Listen’s lead system administrator, Matt Lebofsky. “It is our hope that these data sets will reveal something new and interesting, be it other intelligent life in the universe or an as-yet-undiscovered natural astronomical phenomenon.”Yuri Milner, an entrepreneur and founder of the Breakthrough initiative, said: For the whole of human history, we had a limited amount of data to search for life beyond Earth.So, all we could do was speculate.Now, as we are getting a lot of data, we can do real science and, with making this data available to general public, so can anyone who wants to know the answer to this deep question.The initiatives and strategies in expanding the search for extraterrestrial life were presented at the the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Seattle.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But in recent months it has started to dim in a way never before seen, and without explanation.Some astronomers had initially speculated that the star could be about to explode into a supernova, in a dramatic event that would be visible from Earth. But astronomers now think that something else is happening, which is changing the star in unexpected ways.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow new images show that fading brightness of the star, as well as the fact that the shape as it appears to us appears to be changing.As it has continued to dim, Betelgeuse is now about 36 per cent of its normal brightness. That is so dramatic that it can be seen with the naked eye, but further investigations with telescopes have attempted to learn more about the mysterious dimming.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Helpfully, they took a very similar image, using the same instrument, in January 2019 and before the dimming began – allowing them to compare the two images, and understand more about the changes that Betelgeuse has undergone.Rock at the edge of solar system changes our understanding of planetsResearchers now speculate that the star is not in fact about to go supernova, but is undergoing some other, similarly dramatic process. The new research helps give insight into red supergiants like Betelgeuse and what could happen to cause such unusual behaviour.The two scenarios we are working on are a cooling of the surface due to exceptional stellar activity or dust ejection towards us, said Miguel Montargès, an astronomer from KU Leuven in Belgium, who led the new study. Of course, our knowledge of red supergiants remains incomplete, and this is still a work in progress, so a surprise can still happen.Other images taken using the same Very Large Telescope show that the dust around Betelgeuse is emitting infrared light. That appears to happen when the material that makes up the star is spewed back into space.The phrase \u0027we are all made of stardust\u0027 is one we hear a lot in popular astronomy, but where exactly does this dust come from? siad Emily Cannon, a\u0026nbspPhD\u0026nbspstudent at KU\u0026nbspLeuven.Over their lifetimes, red supergiants like Betelgeuse create and eject vast amounts of material even before they explode as supernovae. Modern technology has enabled us to study these objects, hundreds of light-years away, in unprecedented detail giving us the opportunity to unravel the mystery of what triggers their mass loss.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following.

(Elisa Bray)At the beginning of the gig, Sir Elton announced he had been diagnosed with “walking pneumonia”, an infection in the respiratory tract.Later, on Instagram, the singer told fans he was “deeply upset” by the situation.He wrote: “I want to thank everyone who attended tonight’s gig in Auckland. I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia earlier today, but I was determined to give you the best show humanly possible.“I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I’m disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had. Thank-you so much for your extraordinary support and all the love you showed me during tonight’s performance. I am eternally grateful.

It\u0027s also entirely ultrared, or highly reflective, which is commonplace in the faraway Twilight Zone of our solar system known as the the Kuiper Belt.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The reddish color is indicative of organic molecules.While frozen methane is present, no water has yet been found on the body, which is an estimated 22 miles (36 kilometers) long tip to tip. At a news conference Thursday in Seattle, New Horizons\u0027 chief scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said its size was roughly that of the city.As for the snowman shape, it\u0027s not nearly as flat on the backside as previously thought. Neither the small nor big sphere is fully round, but far from the flatter pancake shape scientists reported a year ago. The research team likened the somewhat flattened spherical forms to the shape of M\u0026ampMs.No rings or satellites have been found. The light cratering suggests Arrokoth dates back to the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. It likely was created by a slow, gentle merger between two separate objects that possibly were an orbiting pair. The resulting fused body is considered a contact binary.This kind of slow-motion hookup likely arose from collapsing clouds in the solar nebula, as opposed to intense collisions theorized to form these planetesimals, or little orbiting bodies.New Horizons flew past Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, more than three years after the spacecraft visited Pluto. Originally nicknamed Ultima Thule, the object received its official name in November Arrokoth means sky in the language of the Native American Powhatan people.Launched in 2006, the spacecraft is now 316 million miles (509 million kilometers) beyond Arrokoth. The research team is looking for other potential targets to investigate. Powerful ground telescopes still under construction will help survey this part of the sky.Emerging technology will enable scientists to develop a mission that could put a spacecraft in orbit around Pluto, 3 billion miles (5 billion kilometers) away, according to Stern. After a few years, that same spacecraft could be sent even deeper into the Kuiper Belt to check out other dwarf planets and objects, he said.The New Horizons scientists reported their latest findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as in three separate papers in the journal Science.David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the studies, said a flyby mission like New Horizons, where encounters last just a few days, is hardly ideal.For future missions, we need to be able to send spacecraft to the Kuiper Belt and keep them there in orbit around objects, Jewitt wrote in a companion piece in Science. That would allow these intriguing bodies to be studied in stunning geological and geophysical detail, he noted.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS. It was designed for a global group of brands, which we no longer are.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Abrahams travelled to India with an e-Visa that permitted her to “attend technicalbusiness meetings”, and was due to expire in October 2020.During the hours she spent blocked at Delhi airport she was told “not one word” about why she was being refused entry. She said the immigration official who first denied her entry was “rude and aggressive and treated me like a criminal”, but that the many other officials she dealt with had been “very polite and courteous”.A government source told The Independent that Ms Abrahams “was not in possession of a valid visa to visit India”, adding that “entry into the country was therefore denied”. Separately, the Associated Press quoted an unnamed official as saying the MP had been informed of this prior to travel “in another communication sent to her”.Ms Abrahams tweeted about her situation while waiting in a room marked as a “deportee cell”, and was met by a large number of critical or abusive replies, purportedly from Indian accounts, saying they were “glad” she was refused entry, calling her a “terrorist sympathiser” and suggesting\u0026nbsp she could have been “put in prison or shot on sight”.Created with Sketch.Protests against India\u0027s new citizenship law Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti activists take part in a torch light procession to protest against the government\u0027s Citizenship Amendment Bill, in GuwahatiPolice clash with protesters during demonstrations against India\u0027s new citizenship law in LucknowMuslim women raise their hands and shout slogans during a protest rally held by the Muslim community against India\u0027s new citizenship law in BangaloreYoung protesters shout slogans and demonstrate with their body painted during a demonstration against India\u0027s new citizenship lawA woman holds a placard at a protest outside Jamia Millia Islamia university over Indias new citizenship law in New Delhi A policeman looks at protesters from leftist groups trying to break through a barricade as they demonstrate against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India\u0027s new citizenship law in KolkataPolice beat protesters with sticks during a demonstration against India\u0027s new citizenship law in LucknowA man holds a placard as he shouts slogans to protest against India\u0027s new citizenship law, during a demonstration in New DelhiProtesters stand with a large Indian flag by the Jama Masjid mosque at a demonstration against Indias new citizenship law in New DelhiA protester from Shaheen Bagh, with an Indian map painted on his face, takes part in a demonstration against India\u0027s new citizenship law at Jantar MantarMuslim women drink chai (tea) on a street in front of a wall covered with posters and graffitis to protest against India\u0027s new citizenship law, during a demonstration in MumbaiMembers of the Karnataka Reserve Police Force swing their sticks to beat two men on a scooter who rode too close to a barricade set up on a street in Mangalore, amid heightened security due to protests over Indias new citizenship lawThe deserted Shaheen Bagh area, that has been blocked off by demonstratorsStudents from various colleges under the aegis of National Students Union of India (NSUI) hold a national flag during a protest rally against India\u0027s new citizenship law in BangaloreKrishak Mukti Sangram Samiti activists take part in a torch light procession to protest against the government\u0027s Citizenship Amendment Bill, in GuwahatiPolice clash with protesters during demonstrations against India\u0027s new citizenship law in LucknowMuslim women raise their hands and shout slogans during a protest rally held by the Muslim community against India\u0027s new citizenship law in BangaloreYoung protesters shout slogans and demonstrate with their body painted during a demonstration against India\u0027s new citizenship lawA woman holds a placard at a protest outside Jamia Millia Islamia university over Indias new citizenship law in New Delhi A policeman looks at protesters from leftist groups trying to break through a barricade as they demonstrate against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India\u0027s new citizenship law in KolkataPolice beat protesters with sticks during a demonstration against India\u0027s new citizenship law in LucknowA man holds a placard as he shouts slogans to protest against India\u0027s new citizenship law, during a demonstration in New DelhiProtesters stand with a large Indian flag by the Jama Masjid mosque at a demonstration against Indias new citizenship law in New DelhiA protester from Shaheen Bagh, with an Indian map painted on his face, takes part in a demonstration against India\u0027s new citizenship law at Jantar MantarMuslim women drink chai (tea) on a street in front of a wall covered with posters and graffitis to protest against India\u0027s new citizenship law, during a demonstration in MumbaiMembers of the Karnataka Reserve Police Force swing their sticks to beat two men on a scooter who rode too close to a barricade set up on a street in Mangalore, amid heightened security due to protests over Indias new citizenship lawThe deserted Shaheen Bagh area, that has been blocked off by demonstratorsStudents from various colleges under the aegis of National Students Union of India (NSUI) hold a national flag during a protest rally against India\u0027s new citizenship law in BangaloreOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Thankfully there was nobody onboard today.\u0026nbsp“The US Coast Guard had rescued the 10 crew members from the vessel back in September 30, 2018.“The vessel has been drifting since and today came ashore on the Cork coastline. What an amazing journey.”Cork County Council said it understood the vessel was most likely diesel-fuelled, which poses less risk of pollution than heavy fuel oil.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But why The war between Blair and Brown blighted Labour’s years in office and held back progress.Even Theresa May’s dismal tenure was worsened by Philip Hammond’s soul-sapping negativity.The friendship of David Cameron and George Osborne, by contrast, succeeded in restoring sanity to our finances.So Boris Johnson knows he must have the Treasury fully onside.He and chief adviser Dominic Cummings need it to enact their ideas, not resist or dilute them.It is clear Sajid Javid’s advisers were considered just such an obstacle.The Sun has a lot of time for The Saj, a decent bloke who commendably stood by his staff.His is a sad departure.He might have proved a fine Chancellor.But Rishi Sunak should too.He is very bright, imaginative and enthused by our post-Brexit prospects.We wish him luck, with a historic Budget next month.Most of the reshuffle was welcome — three appointments in particular.New Attorney General Suella Braverman has an appetite to stop leftie campaigners getting like-minded judges to impose via their courts a political agenda rejected at the ballot box.Anne-Marie Trevelyan looks like the no-nonsense type to rein in the scandalous £.billion foreign aid budget.And Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden will, we hope, ensure non-payment of the BBC licence is decriminalised before ushering in a subscription model.We do have one bit of advice for Boris as he prepares to deliver Brexit in full and spend billions, though: It is fine to bring the Treasury in line. But do not lose sight of the balance sheet.Gordon Brown did — and Britain is still counting the cost.ELLIE Gould fought back hard against her ex-boyfriend’s frenzied kne attack.It wasn’t enough. But it might have been, had she known how to defend herself.So The Sun today backs her friends’ petition for compulsory self­-defence classes in school PE lessons.What a dference they could make to kids’ safety and self-confidence.As Ellie’s mum Carole says: “We teach our children to swim because it’s a le skill. Why not self-defence ”You can sign the petition here.ROSES are gone, violets are too.They still have some daffs.Let’s pray that will do.Happy Valentine’s Day!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Trends can change as new populations are affected.It’s too early to tellthis reported decline will continue.

Billions, for sure.What’s interesting is that the ship did not go down with all hands lost.There were  survivors — and they were able to tell rescuers where the Nuestra Senora had sunk. That information has not been lost.So why are we just sitting back letting Spain and Mexico get on with it Britain needs money for its exciting new railway line and all the hospitals Boris Johnson has promised.Andthere’s a small mountain of it sitting at the bottom of the sea off Mexico’s east coast, why don’t we just sneak over there and help ourselves Certainly, our new six-year-old Chancellor should be considering this . . .  once he’s finished his morning bowl of Frosties and tidied his room.Think about it. We have naval ships in the region waging a hopeless war against South American drug cartels. So why not simply ask them to drive around with their sonar on I feel sure thatthis equipment can find a near-silent Russian submarine gently humming its way through the depths, it would have no trouble at all spotting  tons of gold and silver.Or we could draft in RRS Boaty McBoatface . That’s designed to map the seabed and would be a very useful tool.Frankly, having it in the Caribbean looking for treasure is a much better use of it than having it wandering around Antarctica studying penguins and looking for more dreary evidence of climate change. We know already.I bet the crew would be happier too.Of course, when we do find the loot, Spain will claim it’s theirs, in the same way they say they own Gibraltar.No worries. We’ll just behave like we do when the Greeks say they want the Elgin Marbles back.And Mexico  It’s true the jewels and the gold were sourced from their neck of the woods.But as every schoolboy knows, it’s “finders, keepers”.Britain has a reputation for fair play and decency, but in a cut-and-thrust world we need to be a bit more devious.Maybe then we could find the loot and tell the world we hadn’t. “Nope. Nothing there. Sorry.”IF I were to list all the Bond music in order of greatness – and being a man, EVERYTHING has to be listed like this – Octopussy’s All Time High by Rita Coolidge would be the all-time high.I love Rita Coolidge. She sounds like she’s singing while sitting down.At No, from On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, I’d have We Have All The Time In The World, by Louis ­Armstrong, who sounds like he’s lying down in the bath. And at No it’d be the ­incidental music used during the ski chase in the same movie.I’d have to go a long way down the list – past Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from ­Thunderball, past the music used in the cinema adverts before the film started, and down past the Muzak playing when I took my seat – before I got to the dreary song chosen for the ­latest  outing.Performed by Billie Eilish, it is about as memorable as the middle of a Tuesday night.LIKE lots of box-set enthusiasts, I was captivated by Netflix’s drama The Stranger.“Let’s do one more”, I’d say every night. “Come on. It’s only am.”Set in northern England and starring Richard Armitage, the plot twisted and turned, building to the point that in the final episode I started to wonder how all the endless storylines could all be brought together and tied off.I was intrigued. Fascinated. On the edge of my seat.And then – with a load of stuff still up in the air – it just ended.What I had sat through, then, was a beautully told eight-hour joke. With no punchline.THE BBC has signed up Greta Thunberg to present a new series about monster truck racing in Texas.Only kidding. She’s been signed to present a show on – you’ll never guess – climate change.“I can’t wait. It’ll be so exciting,” said no one.I’VE always said hybrid cars are too heavy, thanks to the fact they have two engines.And now this ­photo of a Toyota Prius proves it.NORMALLY, I’m in full agreement with The Sun’s television critic, Ally Ross.But his review of ­Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Lab show on Netflix was wide of the mark.He described it as “dumb and dangerous”.Wrong, mate. It was way worse than that.At one point, they had two women playing with a vibrator the size of a JCB.And somehow they managed to make the scene even more boring than The One Show.WHENEVER somebody builds a really good bridge, I’ll travel miles out of my way to go and look at it. I realise this is a bit tragic.My favourite bridge in the whole wide world spans the Humber.It’s so graceful and delicate – and when I stand at one end and watch it disappear into the mist on a summer’s morning, I often suffer from a small but embarrassing trouser moment.The only annoying thing about the Humber Bridge is that they went to all the trouble and expense of building it simply to connect the small village of Hessle to the even smaller village of Barton. Two places no one has ever heard of.The fabulous Oresund Bridge was needed because it links Sweden and Denmark.It’s the same story in San Francisco, which has many great bridges that connect the city to the rest of Calornia.That’s the point of a bridge. It links two places that need to be linked.Which brings me on to Boris Johnson’s plan to build a -mile bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.Hmmm. I’m aware the Chinese have built a sea bridge this long, but this is a nation that built a whole new coronavirus hospital in SIX DAYS.We are just not that fast. We can’t even build a new railway line without a -year argument.And the fact is that when we finish our new bridge, midway through the rd Century, we will have linked a place called Larne to a place called Portpatrick.Now, I don’t want to have a downer on the plan.Butwe are going to build a -mile bridge over the sea, wouldn’t it be more usefulit went from Dover to Calais Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If they meet the threshold and have a job offer paying over an estimated £,, they will be let in.Low-skilled immigration will be slashed.Total numbers will fall.This is what Britain voted for.Even the promise of it has calmed anxiety over immigration since the referendum.So it is incredible to see Labour still champion free movement, even outside the EU.Even more so to hear immigration control branded “racist”.It is literally the opposite.We will no longer block skilled staff from India or Africa while admitting anyone from the EU.Boris Johnson now has a Cabinet focused, as one, on forging our new path as an independent nation.Unity of purpose seems to win elections.

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian. And, obviously, it’s lovely that she loves her children so much.But tattooing their names on her forehead where they will remain for all her le  All I can say is: Tattoo in haste . . . repent at leisure.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We truly do.But do Harry and Meghan understand and ever admit to themselves that they owe EVERYTHING to their royal connections Without the magic dust that royalty bestows, JP Morgan — one of the world’s richest banks — would never have flown them in a private jet to an exclusive company beano. Don’t tell Greta Thunberg!And without his royal blood, Prince Harry would not be in talks with Goldman Sachs about a future relationship.If they were not British royalty, Meghan would be a B-list actress whom few people had ever heard of and Harry an old soldier with two rotten A-levelsfrom Eton — a school where my dog Stan could get four good grades and an offer from Oxbridge.I do not doubt Harry and Meghan’s sincerity when they say they want to be financially independent.But because they are poncing on royal connections, the couple have a duty of care to the Queen and to this country.Please don’t embarrass the Royal Family, or British people who shelled out £million for your wedding.Please do not turn into the preening glove puppets of investment bankers.Oh Harry, please don’t turn into Tony Blair in a tiara.Oh Meghan, don’t become the st-century Fergie.Prince Andrew’s reckless friendship with convicted billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein has humiliated and damaged the Royal Family.Andrew’s total lack of judgment may have done irreparable harm to the monarchy.Many of us wonderthe institution will last after the Queen has gone.So show some dignity, Harry and Meghan. Engage your brains, not your bank balance.Have a little DISCRETION. Please do not pimp your royal connections to any passing dodgy billionaire or investment banker who claims to care deeply about your charity work.Frankly, it doesn’t look good so far.The nation cringed when Prince Harry buttonholed Disney boss Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King, aggressively pitching Meghan’s availability for “voiceover” work.A member of the Royal Family begging a Hollywood big-shot for work was not a pretty sight.When they handed in their letter of resignation, Harry and Meghan made lofty announcements about “collaborating” with the Queen, as though Her Majesty, , is some grime DJ who could be brought in to remix their latest single.The brutal truth is that we will not see much of Harry and Meghan in these parts.This week they sacked  loyal UK staff and shut their Buckingham Palace office.But by turning their backs on the royal le, Harry and Meghan have placed themselves in an almost impossible situation.They claim to want to be financially independent of Prince Charles and the British taxpayer.Then they will have to grab the big pay days where they can.They will have to earn phenomenal sums of money to fund the lavish lestyle to which they are accustomed.But there is absolutely nothing in either of their CVs to suggest they can make that kind of dough without flogging their royal connections to the highest bidder.If Harry and Meghan are going to support themselves, they are going to have to get their hands dirty in the working world.Harry’s discussions with Goldman Sachs may be focused on his charity work right now, but investment bankers are not renowned for their boundless human compassion.Big bankers — and mega-rich companies like Netflix and Apple — will look at Harry and Meghan and wonder what they can get out of them.Harry and Meghan are free to demean themselves, as Harry did so spectacularly when he shook his diamond-encrusted begging bowl at the boss of Disney.But please don’t demean this country.Please don’t debase the Royal Family, as Prince Andrew has done.Please, Harry and Meghan — do not embarrass the Queen.Because let’s face it, chaps — without your royal connections, the pair of you really don’t add up to very much at all.After all those wild decades, Keith – who is said to have smoked an estimated , fags in his time – clearly believes in moderation in all things.Especially moderation in moderation.IN a pithy turn of phrase worthy of Oscar Wilde, one commentator mused that Labour’s dishevelled Tracy Brabin looked like she had been “banged over a wheelie bin” in her off-the-shoulder frock in the House of Commons.Showing Tracy how it is done, Kate Beckinsale looked stunning in a very similar off-the-shoulder number at a pre-Oscars party.Kate also looks as though she has never even seen a wheelie bin.But it’s not true. I recall Debbie Harry was a dazzling double NME winner in  – Pin-Up Of The Year and Best Female Singer.The NME may be  years old. But NME award winners never get any older.THE coronavirus could well be China’s Chernobyl – the national calamity that changes everything.As the global death toll of the virus nears ,, the old men in Beijing who run China have never looked so woefully out of their depth.The greatest hero in China today is Dr Li Wenliang, the -year-old Wuhan doctor who tried to warn the Communist regime of the virus.Dr Li was arrested, bullied, humiliated, accused of scaremongering and later died of the virus.That is what happens in a one-party state that considers all criticism to be treason.China does not look like the next economic superpower today.China looks like an inept one-party state that failed to grasp the seriousness of the virus, then stubbornly refused to heed the warnings that could have contained it, and has now exported it to the rest of the world.The coronavirus came out of the so-called wet markets of China, where every conceivable animal is kept in filthy conditions to cater for the Chinese appetite for “exotic” animals.Wolf pups, koala bears and assorted rats, bats and snakes are all on offer for the discerning wildle gourmet, many under the counter.These markets were the breeding ground for Sars nearly  years ago, and they were the breeding ground for the coronavirus.Exactly how stupid can a regime be that allows the existence of these unregulated markets  The virus that is now polluting the entire planet was totally avoidable.Mikhail Gorbachev was convinced that the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in  caused the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later.The Chernobyl explosion “opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression”, said Gorbachev. “To the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue.”If the coronavirus brings down China’s ruling Communist elite, it will be exactly what they deserve.Now Leo has seen his Fine Gael party poll a wretched . per cent of the vote in the Irish general election, going from power to third place overnight.Looks like Leo Varadkar is a teeny-weeny politician now.Now BBC chairman David Clementi squeaks that ending the licence fee will mean scrapping children’s channel CBeebies.Stop our money and you will make all the kiddies cry!But the openly biased BBC stopped being a state broadcaster years ago.It no longer deserves to be funded like one.TANYA McDonnell is a modern success story.Tanya was working in McDonald’s in Washington, Tyne-and-Wear, for £ an hour until a modelling agency spotted her holiday shots on Instagram.“I’d always looked up to people like Kate Moss,” says Tanya. “But I didn’t think I had a chance because I wasn’t pretty enough.”Only in the age of social media could a girl go from having her picture taken on holiday to making a living as a model.And only in the age of social media could someone who looks like Tanya McDonnell fret that she is not pretty enough.I didn’t know he had one.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You are not taught to do that at college when preparing for ordination  years ago. Nor is it something I was expecting to do at the age of . But something has to be done. I was begging on the last day of the February meeting of the General Synod, the governing body of the Church of England. I was supporting from the street two excellent motions to be voted on that day. One was promoting a better friendship between church members and impoverished people in line with the priority given to it by Jesus. The other was opposing the shredding of legal aid which is blocking access to justice for many. Both motions were passed unanimously. I learnt a little of what it is like to be homeless on the streets. Sitting in the cold for hours on end is boring and very uncomfortable. I did not feel the cold until after I had finished the vigil. Then my body felt chilled until it warmed up in the early hours of the next morning. Charities, shelters and cold weather polices of local authorities simply do not meet the need for or the right to a home in all weathers.  While several people entering or leaving Church House stopped for a chat, most walked by asI was not there. That invisibility while lying on the pavement must be very depressing for long term street homeless people. £. was put into my mug which I gave to one of the three street homeless people begging outside Tottenham who I pass on my journey home. I am planning another session in the role of beggar opposite Downing Street. I founded the Zacchaeus  Trustas a charity in  to respond to the Poll Tax and Taxpayers Against Povertyin  to respond to austerity. Both ZK and TAP are committed to working  with and for the poorest UK citizens without allegiance to any political party. I have worked with and for low income families and iniduals for  years. Debt, hunger and homelessness are now very bad and getting worse.By demonstrating for the homeless I wanted to draw the attention of Synod members to the concerns I hear so often from TAPaposs supporters about the Church of Englandaposs commercial use of very valuable land in ways that do not contribute to ending homelessness. Homeless families in temporary accommodation were also in my mind. According to Shelter at least one parent is employed in , out of , such families in England. There is a statement doing the rounds in Government circles that says putting homeless families in temporary accommodation is all right because they have a roof over their heads.  But homeless families can be forced to move several times in up to and over ten years of roofs over their heads.

Debbie Abrahams said she felt like a criminal after she was put in a deportee cell and physically marched onto aflight when authorities said she did not have a valid visa. The Labour MP - who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Kashmir and has been critical of the Indian government - said she was being deported.Theyaposll use another phrase, but yes, she said. Itaposs absolutely shocking. A Foreign Office minister raised the case formally with Indiaaposs High Commissioner today. A Foreign Office spokesman said: We are in contact with the Indian authorities, and Lord Ahmad has spoken with the Indian High Commissioner to understand why Deborah Abrahams MP was denied entry to India.We provided consular assistance to her whilst she was in New Delhi Airport. Kashmir is disputed by India and Pakistan. Last year Ms Abrahams said a legal change by the Indian government betrays the trust of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Speaking from her plane seat, the MP said she wouldnapost be surprisedthe decision was to do with her involvement with the APPG.Indiaaposs High Commission in London hit back, claiming Ms Abrahams did not have a visa to visit India and her refusal was nothing to do with her work on the APPG. The Labour MP told the Mirror she arrived at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi international airport on Monday morning with her Parliamentary aide Harpreet Uppal. Ms Abrahams said she wanted to pay a private visit to her sister-in-lawaposs cousin and aunt, who recently lost a family member, in Delhi - before then travelling with Ms Uppal to Pakistan for an official visit with the APPG. She said she obtained her visa to visit India last October and it was valid for a full year. But when she handed it to a border officer, she said: He was looking on his screen and started shaking his head and going aposno no noapos, and said aposyour visa is rejectedapos. She said the man left with her passport for around  minutes before ing and saying she would not be admitted to India. Ms Abrahams presented the copy of her visa on her phone but claimed the officer was then rude and aggressive, telling her to follow him.  The MP said: I was getting a little bit scared. I didnapost know where he was taking me, what was going to happen. So I said aposno I want to know whataposs happeningapos. Then he shouted at me aposfollow meapos and I said aposdonapost speak to me like thatapos. He took us to what can only be described as a holding area, fenced off cordoned area, with two signs saying aposdeportee cellapos over, and said apossit down and waitapos. I refused to sit down - I wanted as many people as possible to see me. I didnapost know what the hell was going to happen to me. She said she asked to apply for a visa on arrival but was told she would not be allowed in. By this point, she said there were around five officials some of which were apologetic and didnapost know what was going on. She said: I felt like a criminal, I really did. Thereaposs no other word - being escorted everywhere with security guards, made to sit in a transit lounge for an hour being watched and asked all sorts of details which I refused to co-operate on. The MP has spoken out about the revocation of article , a law which gave Kashmir a level of autonomy, by the Indian government. She wrote to Indiaaposs High Commissioner to the UK last August: The unilateral decision made by the Government of India to remove Article  betrays the trust of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, dating back to the accession in .

Cooper Johnstone had the flesh ripped from his arm when he was bitten by a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. He had been knocking on his friendaposs door in Ormskirk, Lancs, on the first day of the summer holidays last July when he was attacked. And he has been left permanently disfigured and needing surgery. Cooper thought he was going to die in the savage attack and has since been plagued by severe panic attacks and a crippling phobia of dogs which have left him unable to sleep and leave the house, meaning he has to be home schooled. But the animalaposs owner Sarah Haselton, , escaped a ban on keeping animals when she appeared at Preston Magistrates Court to be sentenced on Thursday. The NHS worker had plead guilty to being the owner of a dangerously out of control animal, causing injury, at an earlier hearing last month. She was ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work and told to pay the family £ in compensation. Imposing a sentence, magistrate Martin Sears said: We have discussed at greatwhat appears to be a sad and tragic case. We do not feel it is necessary to disqualy you from having a dog. But speaking after the hearing, Cooperaposs parents Ellis and Karan Johnstone expressed their outrage and aposbitter disappointmentapos a ban was not imposed. The couple, who run a party tent hire company together, are now calling for all animal owners to have compulsory pet insurance which can be used to pay for psychiatric help for bite victims.  Mum Karan, , from Ormskirk, said: Cooper not only has awful scars to live with for the rest of his le but is having a terrible time with panic attacks, to the point where he is housebound. He is in a bad way. Every time we try to take him out there is always a dog and no matteritaposs on a lead or not, he has a terrible panic attack. Itaposs not nice to watch your child having a panic attack while trying to leave the supermarket just because someone has left their dog in the doorway. When he has a panic attack he thinks he is going to die, itaposs just awful. If he sees a dog, he either freezes or runs and has run across a road in fear so many times without looking. Itaposs just not fair for him to be going through this. We want to raise awareness and campaign for changes to the law regarding dog ownership. We think insurance should be made compulsory for all dog owners.  This particular owner didnapost have any - had she been responsible and had insurance, Cooper wouldnapost be suffering so badly as he would have been to access private psychiatrists at an early stage of his recovery and may have overcome a lot of his fears by now. The compensation we have been granted in court today is £ a month, this wonapost get our son the psychological help he needs. Cooperaposs family say he is still on an NHS waiting list for access to a psychologist at Alder Hey childrenaposs hospital, eight months after the attack. The youngster spent two days in hospital recovering from his physical injuries after the attack, which caused puncture wounds to his chest as well as bites to his arm, and needed surgery on his hand and the back of his forearm.

For many years, she ran a busy Jamaican greengrocers.  nBefore that, Mrs Gayle owned a fashion store with her late husband Dennis.  n  nShe is yet another “ee” – Jamaican-born UK citizens who start a new le back in the land of their birth – to die violently.  nEvadney was a friend to Lionel Martin, better known to fans as Saxa, the saxophonist with top two-tone band The Beat.  nShe was featured in the Birmingham Mail in  after winning the fortune at a Birmingham casino.  nThe article was captioned: “Evadney Gayle nets the highest ever UK win from a £ stake on a national game – £,. from just a £ bet!”  nNews of her murder in November has stunned Birmingham’s community.  nOne close friend, who asked not to be named, said: “She was a lovely, lovely lady. When she said she was going to Jamaica, I told her, ‘don’t fight any issues about land, don’t go there and fight people for land – it’s not worth it’.  n“There are people ing to Jamaica every day, hundreds of thousands have ed back home.”  nCommenting on her friend’s death, she added: “When they do that in Jamaica, they make sure they are dead.  n“It’s usually about a family feud over land, jobs or money. Ninety-nine per cent of the time, it’s not done by strangers.”  nByron Christian, a regular customer at Mrs Gayle’s shop, said: “She was a proper business person. Very chatty, very popular. Her shop was a real meeting place.  n“It’s tragic, very tragic.”  nClose friend Leroy James, a restaurant worker, said: “I was shocked, every one is shocked. She was such a nice person.”  nA member of the Birmingham Association of Jamaican Nationals said: “It’s shocking, she was always saying she was going back to Jamaica. Her shop on Dudley Road sold Caribbean food and was well known.”  nEvadney has been added to the list of Birmingham residents violently killed in Jamaica.  nIn , businessman Keith Murrain was abducted, stripped and had his throat cut shortly after arriving at Jamaica’s Norman Manley airport.  nIn , Birmingham charity worker Delroy Walker, who, like Evadney, had ed to start a new le in the land of his birth, was stabbed to death in his Rio Nuevo home.  nAs yet, no-one has been convicted for the murders.  n  n   nThe list of murdered ees – UK citizens who scrimped and saved toto Jamaica – is disturbingly long and getting longer with each year.  nFollowing Evadney’s death, Percival LaTouche, President of the Jamaica Association for the Resettlement of Returning Residents, has urged those considering coming back to the island permanently to think again.  n“Jamaica has become a fertile place to commit murder,” he warned.  nHe alleged last year saw a  per cent rise in ee murders. In all, there were  murders.  nMr LaTouche added: “The type of murders, the barbarity, the brutalism, the way that people are being killed... I am not encouraging anybody to come back here to live.”  nHe is adamant the lives of well over  ex-pats have been snuffed out since . In , eight of them were British.  nFriends said Mrs Gayle, whose husband died in a car crash in the late s, travelled to the West Indies two years ago, but regularly ed to Birmingham.  nThe mother of two daughters and two sons had moved to the home she had built in St Toolies only three weeks before the November  murder.  nA nephew, living on the island, told the Jamaican Star: This incident has shaken our family. Everybody’s messed up because of the way she died. Nobody has taken it good. I don’t even sleep from last night.”  nLocal councillor Claudia Morant-Baker described the victim as a nature lover. She was known to neighbours as “Miss Birdie”.  nCoun Morant-Baker said: “The springs are behind her house, she loved nature and that is why she decided to stay here.  n“She has been back and forth for a few years, but she settled here for a few months, probably a year. It has been three weeks that she would have moved in the house. Sunday night would have made three weeks.  n“Sunday night when I saw her lying in that pool of blood, I cried. It could have been me, my mother or sister who was taken away so brutally.”  nTop news stories from n   nMrs Gayle’s death brought the  death toll in Manchester – a parish of only  square miles – to .  nWith the body count growing, Birmingham community activist Desmond Jaddoo, who has been in contact with Mrs Gayle’s family, urged would-be ees to approach the le-changing experience with eyes open.  nAnd he is critical of the Jamaican government for failing to provide the services, support and infrastructure those coming back to the island need.  nHe had a simple tip for UK residents prepared to plunge into a totally dferent lestyle. “Go and have a taster,” he said last night. “Go for three months, then come back. Establish your presence.  n“I think security is an issue, not just for ees, but also those deported to Jamaica. The support mechanism is non-existent.  n“It is not for me to tell people to go or not to go, I can only urge people to assess their inidual circumstances. If people know there are family disputes or there are issues in the area, they must take those into consideration.  n“You need to dot the “i’s” and cross the “t’s” and measure the risk.  n“There are families ing who are open to exploitation because there are no support services for them.

It has been three weeks that she would have moved in the house. Sunday night would have made three weeks. n“Sunday night when I saw her lying in that pool of blood, I cried. It could have been me, my mother or sister who was taken away so brutally.” n Top news stories from nMrs Gayle’s death brought the  death toll in Manchester – a parish of only  square miles – to . nWith the body count growing, Birmingham community activist Desmond Jaddoo, who has been in contact with Mrs Gayle’s family, urged would-be ees to approach the le-changing experience with eyes open. nAnd he is critical of the Jamaican government for failing to provide the services, support and infrastructure those coming back to the island need. nHe had a simple tip for UK residents prepared to plunge into a totally dferent lestyle. “Go and have a taster,” he said last night. “Go for three months, then come back. Establish your presence. n“I think security is an issue, not just for ees, but also those deported to Jamaica. The support mechanism is non-existent. n“It is not for me to tell people to go or not to go, I can only urge people to assess their inidual circumstances. If people know there are family disputes or there are issues in the area, they must take those into consideration. n“You need to dot the “i’s” and cross the “t’s” and measure the risk. n“There are families ing who are open to exploitation because there are no support services for them. If you have doubts about ing, address those doubts first and foremost.”

Former Birmingham shopkeeper Evadney Gayle had gone back to the island where she was born and moved to a home she built just weeks before her tragic death. The le-changing windfall had helped Mrs Gayle build her dream home - but the palatial property in St Tooties tragically became the setting for her barbaric murder. The -year-old grandmotheraposs body was discovered by a relative, Birmingham Live reports. It is understood an arrest has been made and the suspect was known to Mrs Gayle. Mrs Gayle had lived in Edgbaston, Birmingham, and was a popular figure. For many years, she ran a busy Jamaican greengrocers. Before that, Mrs Gayle owned a fashion store with her late husband Dennis.  She is yet another “ee” – Jamaican-born UK citizens who start a new le back in the land of their birth – to die violently. Evadney was a friend to Lionel Martin, better known to fans as Saxa, the saxophonist with top two-tone band The Beat. She was featured in the Birmingham Mail in  after winning the fortune at a Birmingham casino. The article was captioned: “Evadney Gayle nets the highest ever UK win from a £ stake on a national game – £,. from just a £ bet!” News of her murder in November has stunned Birmingham’s community. One close friend, who asked not to be named, said: “She was a lovely, lovely lady. When she said she was going to Jamaica, I told her, ‘don’t fight any issues about land, don’t go there and fight people for land – it’s not worth it’. “There are people ing to Jamaica every day, hundreds of thousands have ed back home.” Commenting on her friend’s death, she added: “When they do that in Jamaica, they make sure they are dead. “It’s usually about a family feud over land, jobs or money. Ninety-nine per cent of the time, it’s not done by strangers.” Byron Christian, a regular customer at Mrs Gayle’s shop, said: “She was a proper business person. Very chatty, very popular. Her shop was a real meeting place. “It’s tragic, very tragic.” Close friend Leroy James, a restaurant worker, said: “I was shocked, every one is shocked. She was such a nice person.” A member of the Birmingham Association of Jamaican Nationals said: “It’s shocking, she was always saying she was going back to Jamaica. Her shop on Dudley Road sold Caribbean food and was well known.” Evadney has been added to the list of Birmingham residents violently killed in Jamaica. In , businessman Keith Murrain was abducted, stripped and had his throat cut shortly after arriving at Jamaica’s Norman Manley airport. In , Birmingham charity worker Delroy Walker, who, like Evadney, had ed to start a new le in the land of his birth, was stabbed to death in his Rio Nuevo home. As yet, no-one has been convicted for the murders.  The list of murdered ees – UK citizens who scrimped and saved toto Jamaica – is disturbingly long and getting longer with each year.

Questions have been raised about the CPSapos decision to pursue a case against Caroline Flack following the staraposs tragic death on Saturday.The former Love Island presenter was was being taken to court for assault following an alleged early-morning altercation with Caroline’s boyfriend Lewis Burton, , in December. Lewis refused to apospress chargesapos - essentially an American concept - but the CPS decided to pursue the case. Following her death, broadcast and talent agent Louisa McDonald released a statement on behalf of Carolineaposs management firm in which they criticised the CPSapos decision to pursue the high-profile case. The Crown Prosecution Service pursued this when they knew not only how very vulnerable Caroline was but also that the alleged victim did not support the prosecution and had disputed the CPS version of events, she said. The CPS should look at themselves today and how they pursued a show trial that was not only without merit but not in the public interest. And ultimately resulted in signicant distress to Caroline. Our thoughts are with Caroline’s family at this time. Francis Ridley, Money Talent Management. Asked about the criticism of the decision to prosecute Caroline, a CPS spokesman said: Our deepest sympathies go to the family and friends of Caroline Flack. Given the tragic circumstances, we will not comment on the specics of this case at this stage.  Nazir Afzal, a former Chief Crown Prosecutor, spoke to LBC about the case. He said the concept of prosecutions where the victim or complainant doesnapost want to pursue it is actually very common. Adding, itaposs not because itaposs Caroline Flack, it would happen dozens of times every week. This is because we as a country, he said, have decided that weaposre not handling domestic abuse very well. According to the CPSapos Domestic Violence: How prosecution decisions are reached document, they must be satisfied there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each defendant on each charge.  If there is enough evidence, the case will proceed providing itaposs in the public interest - eventhe victim does wish the provide evidence or support the prosecution. We always think very carefully about the interests of the victim when we decide where the public interest lies. But we prosecute cases on behalf of the public at large and not just based on the interests of any articular inidual. There can be dficulties in striking this balance. The views and interests of the victim are important,but they cannot be the final word on the subject of a CPS prosecution. Any future risks to the victim, their children or any other potential victim have to be taken into consideration.  A case can proceed eventhe victim withdraws support or no longer wishes to give evidence. Sometimes, victims will ask the police not to proceed any further with the case and say that they no longer wish to give evidence. There may be a number of explanations for this. This does not mean that the case will automatically be stopped. The document then outlines that the more serious the offence, the more likely we are tho prosecute in the public interest, eventhe victim says that they do not wish us to do so. In cases where we have sufficient other evidence, we may decide to proceed without relying on the evidence of the victim at all. The CPS can continue to pursue a case eventhe parties involved have reconciled or the injury was minor. In certain circumstances a victimaposs statement can be used as evidence without them being called to court.

BILLION per year, according to new research. A study revealed  per cent, or . million of all drivers, have seriously damaged their own car while looking for a space to park over the past  months. On average they have been left with a whopping £ repair bill to fix their mishap. The research by SKODA UK revealed  per cent of drivers have hit a lamppost, tree or space ider in a car park. Four in  of the , UK motorists polled also admitted they had accidentally hit another car with their door when they were getting out of their vehicle. And over the past year the average driver has heard the painful sound of their wheels scraping against a kerb on two occasions - causing irritating scuffs and scratches on their alloys. But despite the number of red-faced motorists admitting to errors,  per cent regard themselves as good parkers. However, just  per cent are confident they would be good enough at parking to satisfy an instructorthey re-took their driving test. A spokesperson for SKODA said: While many people feel confident in their parking capabilities the numbers show motorists have forked out signicant sums in the last  months repairing their cars from parking mishaps. The advanced technology on our cars means they no longer have to do the parking themselves. Driver aids, such as the Park Assiston our Kodiaq family SUV, help reduce stress around parking and should see the number of parking prangs decrease so Brits wonapost be hurt where it hurts most - in the pocket.  SKODA conducted the research to highlight a number of clever features on its large family SUV, Kodiaq, which will help to bring an end to frustrating car park bloopers. Notable features include Park Assist, where the car will park itself, and door edge protection - a protector that slides out automatically as the door is opened ensuring damage doesnapost occur to the driveraposs car or cars in close proximity. The survey also revealed the tension caused by parking - with  per cent confessing to having an argument with another motorist or bystander because of a parking disagreement.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA London City worker says his nose was broken in a violent attack and robbery by two teenagers shouting aposcoronavirusapos at him. Pawat Silawattakun, , says he was assaulted on his local high street in front of crowds of onlookers as he made his way home to his flat in west London. It is thought to be the first reported case of a hate crime in Britain linked to the virus outbreak.Mr Silawattakun told the Observer he got off a bus in Fulham to walk home in the late afternoon when he was suddenly accosted by two teens.The man, who works in the City, told the newspaper he was wearing noise-cancelling headphones and took them off as the pair started shouting at him. He posted about the incident on Facebook, claiming they were yelling Coronavirus. Coronavirus haha in his face while filming him on a phone. Mr Silawattakun said: I didn’t get a chance to say anything – ‘Please stop’, or ‘Why are you doing this ’ – when one of them snatched the headphones from my neck.apos” He said the pair laughed at him and didnapost initially run away, and his first impression was that he was being bullied rather than robbed. But the pair then reportedly fled across the road, with Mr Silawattakun giving chase for around  metres. He says he tore after them shouting why are you doing this. As they crossed a road and reached a traffic island, one of the teens turned around and punched him to the ground, he said. Mr Silawattakun said he was left bleeding and with a broken nose, and that his shouts for help from bystanders went unheeded. He told the Observer: “No one seemed to care or pay attention initially”. His attackers didnapost flee the scene, and he was able to take pictures of them to give to police. Eventually, two people came to his aid and he got an Uber to hospital. In his Facebook post he expanded on his shock at the attack, and how few people came to his aid. The City worker urged people to share his experience and warned other people of east Asian descent to be wary. Whilst I felt powerless because no one in the public really helped me, and it is uncomfortable recounting what has happened to me, something needs to be done. I have faith that the situation was confusing for the public, and the ones who were aware may have thought he had a kne or a more dangerous weapon on him. I am not expecting heroism from the average citizen. But I will be more powerlessI do not speak up, and ignorant people will start saying it is my fault that I chased him that I had my headphones on display and what I expected to happen when I caught up to the perpetrator. I would like to simply ask my fellow East Asians to be careful in the UK .  He continued in the now viral Facebook post: I do not want to scare any of you, but this really happened to mebut be vigilant and try not to be alone. Equally, law enforcement must be ramped up at this time. Where our world leaders fuel xenophobia and hatred, the first people to be educated by this rhetoric are the uneducated – the next generation of iniduals where it was our responsibility to instil critical thinking, sensibility, and respect, whether rich or poor. The indirect damage that the fear and misunderstanding of the ‘coronavirus’ has caused far outweigh the direct damage that the virus has thus far inflicted upon our society. Mr Silawattakun reportedly moved to England as a youngster to attend boarding school in Surrey before studying chemical engineering at Cambridge University. He told the Observer: “It’s made me very wary, it’s a terrible feeling knowing that they’re still out there. It isn’t just a robbery, there’s also knowing that I’ve been targeted because of my ethnicity, and that they were filming me to humiliate me, aseast Asians are all submissive and easy targets.”Mr Silawattakun said he had received dozens of messages after posting about his ordeal on Facebook from people sharing their own experiences of racism in the wake of the outbreak. Mr Silawattakun said his parents had flown to the UK from Thailand to support him as he undergoes an operation on his nose and takes time off work. Scotland Yard told the Observer police are investigating an aggravated robbery on Fulham Rd, that left the victim with a broken nose and requiring hospital treatment. The attack comes as the outbreak of coronavirus spreading from its origin in China around the globe, with people of Asian descent reporting being shunned or racially abused. The World Health Organisation officially named the virus COVID-, sticking to its principle of avoiding naming the country at the heart of the outbreak in a bid to help avoid stigmatising groups of people.

Ahsan Khan, , was kned during a street fight in Oldham, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of Sunday and later died from his injuries. It has emerged that Khan was sentenced to five years in jail in  after the -year-oldaposs buttocks were burned with a hot iron and he was sexually assaulted and beaten, the Manchester Evening News reports. Khan, then , and three others poured salt and lemon juice over the boyaposs blistered skin as the victim was tortured for hours - suffering horric injuries - during the October  attack.  The -year-old was bound with tape around his hands, feet and mouth after he was lured to a home in the Werneth area of Oldham. He was punched and kicked repeatedly, his hair was cut with scissors, and he was stripped and a kne was taken to his back. A hot iron was used to burn his buttocks, back and stomach, and salt and lemon juice was poured onto the burns to cause anguish. After several hours, the victim was finally able to leave the house.  Khan was convicted of blackmail,  imprisonment, wounding with intent, ABH, theft and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. Several others were jailed. Shohaib Khan, , was sentenced to six years and six months. Sufyan Yaqub, , who lured the victim to the house, and Adam Hussain, , were jailed for four years.  All three admitted blackmail,  imprisonment, wounding with intent and ABH. A -year-old boy pleaded guilty to a section  assault and was sentenced to a -month supervision programme with night-time curfew. At the time, Detective Inspector Paul Walker said: “This was a sickening and prolonged attack on a young boy which left him so shaken and terried that he didn’t even want to tell his parents what had happened. “The emotional scars from this shocking attack will haunt him for the rest of his le and I could not even begin to imagine the agony and suffering that he endured.  “Thankfully, his attackers have now been sentenced but this can never fully repair the damage that this barbaric incident has done. “I want to pay tribute to the victim and his family for having the bravery to come forward and give evidence that has helped us catch and convict the people that have inflicted this upon him.” Meanwhile, a murder investigation has been launched following Khanaposs death.  The teenager was described as a good lad by those who knew him, the Manchester Evening News reported earlier. Three men - two aged  and another aged  - were arrested. All three were detained on suspicion of murder. Forensic teams and plain-clothes officers were seen working inside the cordon yesterday. A witness said he saw several police cars and ambulances arrive on the street at about .am.  He said the victim was lying in the road as paramedics tried to resuscitate him. A woman who lives on the street said: I’ve never seen anything like this. It’s scary to wake up and see this on your doorstep. Detectives are appealing for anyone with information about Khanaposs death to come forward.

The Duchess of Cambridge shared lots of sweet details about her children and giving birth during interview on Giovanna Fletcheraposs Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast. These are some of our highlights...Speaking about why she decided to introduce Prince George to the world on the steps of the Lindo Wing: Everyone had been so supportive and both William and I were really conscious that this was something that everyone was excited about and you know we’re hugely grateful for the support that the public had shown us, and actually for us to be able to share that joy and appreciation with the public, I felt was really important. Admitting they practised the famous aposcar seatapos moment with a doll: We were like ‘What do we do ... in a swaddle ’. ‘How’s this supposed to work !’. We’d even tried to practice with a little baby, like a little doll, at home but you know it just never works out the way you planned it so it was quite hard to do that on the world’s stage, but no, he did a very good job. On holding Prince George for the first time: Amazing, amazing. It is extraordinary as I’ve said. How can the human body do that  It is utterly extraordinary actually. And he was very sweet. And also sort of relieved that he was a happy, healthy boy. Williamaposs panicked question about parenting: It wasn’t that quiet in our household. William was like ‘Oh my gosh is this what parenting is going to be like  On her experience with hypnobirthing: I’m not going to say that William was standing there sort of, chanting sweet nothings at me. He definitely wasn’t! I didn’t even ask him about it, but it was just something I wanted to do for myself. On her mum guilt: Anyone who doesnapost as a mother is actually lying. Even this morning, coming to the nursery visit here - George and Charlotte were like aposMummy how could you possibly not be dropping us off as school this morning apos Itaposs a constant challenge.

she needed to repay £, in child benefit to the government because of commission her partner had earnedShareCommentsByZoe Chamberlain:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror -

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum was stunned when she learned she and her partner had to pay back £, of child benefit because of a little-known rule. Lorraine Dyer, from Halesowen, West Mids, has child benefit paid directly into her bank account. But she and partner Gareth were shocked when they were told by HMRC they owed thousands back to the government due to commission he had received from his job as a recruitment consultant. A rule is in place whereby iniduals who earn more than £, have to pay back a certain amount of their child benefit in income tax. And earnings that tip them over the threshold can come from money earned as commission, overtime, bonuses or even a company car allowance. Gareth works as a recruitment consultant and didn’t realise that his commission had tipped him over the edge, Lorraine, who runs Mini First Aid classes, told Birmingham Live. “It’s the fact it came out of the blue that was so annoying,we had known we would have cancelled immediately! she said. We always follow all the rules and don’t try to cheat at anything. It seems HMRC are getting a nice tidy sum from something that they could have easily adjusted. Many of our friends experienced this too, so it seems weaposre not a minority! We received no notication, we were just told we had a £, debt. Then when we questioned it, they added on an additional fine for delayed payment. She added: The tax office said he was supposed to have sent self assessment tax s but he didn’t think he had to do this because he’s not self employed. He’s never had to do that before. “It gets set up automatically and then you just forget about it. It worked out to be around three years worth that we owed. It had been coming in for such a long time, around £ a month that we didn’t really notice it going in. They said we could pay it back in installments over a year but that’s quite a short timeframe. It’s money we could have spent on a holiday. The rule, which was brought in back in  but is not very well known, currently means families have to pay back one per cent for every £ they earn over the threshold. And Lorraine is not the first parent to be caught unawares by this rule. Richard and Rebekha Nicholls, from Grimsby, were told to pay back a hefty £, after encountering the same problem. In that case, Richardaposs company car was what tipped them over the limit. An HMRC spokesperson said customers liable to the High Income Child Benefit Charge can elect to opt out of receiving payments of Child Benefit and still receive the other advantages of claiming it. This includes protecting their NI contributions record, as well as ensuring their child receives an NI number in the future. They said: “We use a wide array of channels to reach those who may be liable to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

An entire hinged Ottoman style bed crashed down onto mum-of-three Claire Montello after she pulled it to reach into the underbed storage for an MP player she had dropped. But the piston holding up the mattress failed and the -year-old was trapped without the strength in her one free arm to lt the bed up. Her phone was out of reach - and she feared sheaposd die. Terried Claire screamed and shouted to no avail and even had to lean on the bed - further compressing her arm - when her legs grew too tired to stand. Claire from Grangewood, Chesterfield, said her arm was flat as a pancake but it then swelled up dramatically, before it burst. She spent two weeks in hospital where she endured four operations, and is waiting to seesheaposll regain the use of her left arm. Claire said: I just canapost believe it happened. I thought I was going to die. I had to keep making myself sick to keep the moisture in my mouth as a way to survive. I must have vomited about  times. Because the wardrobe was right next to the bed I couldnapost even sit down. I knew Francesco wouldnapost be back until the morning so I had no choice but to sit on the bed. I couldnapost stand up for that long. I couldnapost sleep through it I was in so much agony. Iaposm surprised I didnapost pass out of the pain but I was and for the whole  hours. Claire was home alone at .pm on  January and went to get her MP from underneath her bed to listen to music. Her MP player fell down a gap in the middle of her bed - which is split in half, with two sides which can be lted up on a hinge near the wall, to access storage beneath. She jumped off, lted up one side, and was reaching under the raised mattress, when the bed smashed down on her arm - trapping it from the elbow down.  With her mobile phone out of reach and unable to lt the king-size bed up by herself, Claire said she thought sheaposd die. She said: I was screaming and shouting to get some kind of response but it doesnapost help that I live next door to a -year-old man whose deaf. I could hear his TV. All the lights were on in my house so the chances of me getting some kip were nil. I had BBC News on loop and it was doing my head in. I was sitting there thinking aposOh god not the sixth time Iaposve heard this.aposSo it was quite hard taking my mind off what was actually happening. I had no choice but to go to the toilet there and then.  Staying awake throughout the whole night, it was only when care worker husband Francesco, , ed from an overnight sht at .am she was finally set free. As soon as I saw Francesco it was the biggest sigh of relief, she said. He was swearing like anything. I just remember him saying: aposOh my f***ing sh**. What the f*** apos He then lted it up as quick as he could. There was just this massive dent in my arm.  Then it started swelling up like a football and just burst. It was terrible. I donapost even knowIaposll get full control of my left arm back. Itaposs just a waiting game at the moment. Husband Francesco added: I just couldnapost believe it when I saw her. I knew something was up when I walked in and all the lights were on and the TV was on. When I left to go to work she didnapost seem ill so I thought it was weird she would have gone to bed without turning everything off. Then I saw her and I was swearing like anything. I just couldnapost believe it. I lted up the bed and when she got her arm out it was flat. Iaposve never seen an arm go that flat before.  Claire was rushed to Royal Derby hospital and was kept in for a two week stay and underwent four operations. Doctors performed a skin graft using skin from her thigh. She had a muscle removed and doctors told her there is a : chance she will regain movement in her left arm, she said. Claire said: Iaposm now in absolute agony. Iaposve got a splint on it and I canapost feel anything. If that wasnapost in there my arm would just be a floppy mess. Iaposm having to do everything with my right arm. I canapost wash or do basic things by myself. Iaposve had to get Franco to start tying my hair up. But to be fair for a first attempt he doesnapost do a bad job. Heaposs been absolutely brilliant. I donapost know what Iaposd do without him. Heaposs being going back and forth from work cooking me meals and looking after me.

Laura Rudd says her “world came crashing down” when she came across paramedics desperately trying to save her partner Nigel Glanville, as she went out searching for him while clutching their two-year-old boy. She had become worried after -year-old Nigel failed tohome from run on Saturday, February . The dad collapsed in the street near his home in Wilberfoss, Yorkshire, after suffering a heart attack. He was pronounced dead at the scene. But, while trying to grieve for the loss of her partner of almost a decade, Laura was shocked to find she was left to fend for herself financially.She has now launched a campaign to end the “heartless discrimination” unmarried parents suffer when their partners die, Hull Live reports.“I found the ambulance when I went out to look for Nigel with our little boy Noah,” said Laura, “and from there, our world came crashing down. “I lost the love of my le and our little boy lost his daddy at an age when he is far too young to grasp what that means. He just thinks his daddy is hiding and keeps asking when he is going to come home.” Almost immediately following Nigel’s death, Laura found herself thrust into legal limbo, despite being his partner for the last nine years and the mother of their toddler son. Grieving families are still being denied benefits of up to £, because the government only makes support payments to married couples – despite a decision in the Supreme Court  months ago that ruled its position was unlawful. Laura Rudd, , has launched a campaign to finally change the law. “Instead of spending Valentine’s Day with Nigel,” Laura said, “I had to register his death and begin to organise his funeral. It was a truly low point in the worst week of my le. “However, I struggled to even complete the paperwork and was recorded as ‘person organising funeral’, rather than his partner or the mother of his child. “According to the law, I donapost count. I even had to register him as ‘single’.  It was a spit in the face for nearly a decade spent together, simply because in the eyes of the law Noah and I aren’t even recognised.” Laura and Nigel had recently bought a house together and now the schoolteacher faces paying the mortgage alone while juggling childcare for her son. She must also find around £, to pay for Nigel’s funeral, which she does not have. To make matters worse, she discovered she is not eligible for financial support that would have been made available had she and Nigel tied the knot or been in a civil partnership. Bereavement support payment was introduced in April  to replace three separate payments - widowed parent’s allowance, bereavement payment and bereavement allowance. It is paid as a lump sum of up to £, and then at a rate of up to £ a month for the first  months after the death. Those who lost a partner before the rule change can continue to claim the older benefits until their children leave full-time education or they move in with a new partner. However, anyone who loses a partner to whom they were not married is not entitled to make a claim. There are . million cohabiting couples in the UK, and of these about . million have children. “All for the sake of a piece of paper, I get nothing,” Laura said.  “I am nothing – I count as nothing and neither does our child, our beautul son, who is not yet even three years old. On top of losing him, worrying about finances and everything , I now have to find £, from somewhere to pay for his funeral. “To me, this is blatant, heartless discrimination, adding to an already painful process. How is this still happening in   “Thousands of people across the UK every week must be facing this same predicament that I now face, and it is just not good enough.” In August , the Supreme Court ruled that denying an unmarried mother of four children widowed parent’s allowance amounted to discrimination, in a decision that was expected to extend the rights of unmarried couples. Delivering the majority decision, Lady Hale said: “It is dficult indeed to see the justication for denying people and their children benefits, or paying them at a lower rate of benefit, simply because the adults are not married to one another. Their needs, and more importantly their children’s needs, are the same.” However,  months on, there has been no change in the law.

The long haulage driver told the BBC that he was he was used to rough weather but speculated that some would-be visitors might have been put off.

Laurence Sanderson was driving his we Anna and their three children to Dorset for a half term holiday when the  year old Oak tree came crashing down as Storm Dennis battered the country on Saturday evening. But luckily their £, Model X Autopilot aposaposkicked inaposapos and slammed the emergency brakes on, saving their lives. Incredibly, another Model X coming the other way was also crushed by the tree with the Autopilotalso saving the three occupantsapos lives. Speaking about his familyaposs brush with death, financial consultant Laurence said it was a aposaposmiracleaposapos they survived. aposaposAnother second and we would have been crushed as I wouldnapost have been able to react in time. The car undoubtedly saved our lives. We would have been killed without it.aposapos Dramatic pictures taken by Laurence from the scene on the A at Sturminster Marshall show just how lucky his family including his children, Max, , Isabella, nine, and Rex, three, were. He said: aposaposMy we is a bit battered and has two black eyes, a bump on the head and bruising to her chest but apart from that we escaped unscathed. aposaposWe were driving along and out of the corner of my eye I saw the tree coming down. The car was on Autopilot and the emergency breaking kicked in.  aposaposIt was chaos with smoke coming from the car and people shouting to get out. People from other cars came to help get the kids out. It was an amazing response. aposaposPower lines came down and there were live wires at the back of the car so we were getting everyone to safety while being careful of them. aposaposMy we thought she was going to die when she saw the tree fall. I canapost believe weaposre all still alive. Elon Musk has done us proud.aposapos Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety behind the wheel.  external cameras, a radar,  ultrasonic sensors and a powerful onboard computer provide an additional layer of safety to guide drivers on their journey.  Autopilot uses these features to see and sense the environment around the car. This robust sensor and camera suite provides drivers with an awareness of their surroundings that a driver alone would not otherwise have. A powerful onboard computer processes these inputs in a matter of milliseconds to help make your driving safer and less stressful. Active safety features made possible by Teslaaposs Autopilot hardware and software system include Automatic Emergency Braking which detects cars or obstacles that the car may impact and applies the brakes accordingly. Speaking about the other car, Laurence, from Brentwood, Essex, said: aposaposIn an amazing one a million chance another Tesla Model X car was also hit on the other side of the tree. The police have told me that all three are fine so eight lives have quite literally saved due to this amazing car.aposapos Construction company director Josh Whitelock, , from Wimborne, was driving the other Tesla with his girlfriend, Kitty McConnell and her mum, Julia as passengers when the tree came down.  aposaposI was on Autopilot driving home when I saw a flash from the power line which lit up the tree as it fell. We stopped suddenly. There was a loud crack and then the sound of metal on metal.aposaposI was expecting to turn around and see my girlfriend and her mother impaled by branches but incredibly that wasnapost the case. They were both ok apart from a bit of whiplash. It was a miracle we all survived. aposaposI helped get them both out of the car and then checked on the other driver on the other side of the tree. When I saw the open Falcon door I couldnapost believe it.  aposaposWe were just in pure shock. Tesla has saved eight lives. aposaposIt just goes to show that le can be over in a split second but thanks to Tesla making amazing cars that wasnapost the case this time.aposapos Laurence said he was so thankful to the local community who came to the familyaposs aid. aposaposOur car has been written off but the landowner has given us his Range Rover Sport to use until we get sorted. aposaposAnother couple who saw what happened, Tony and Olga from Vines Farm took us to their home and kept the kids entertained and fed and watered us.aposapos  Storm Dennis continues to batter the country this morning.

Following in her late mother-in-law Princess Dianaaposs footsteps, Kate welcomed all three of her children at the Lindo Wing at St Maryaposs Hospital in London. But in the lead up to welcoming her first child she was also forced to spend time in hospital after suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum - extreme morning sickness. In her most revealing interview yet, she told Giovanna Fletcheraposs podcast Happy Mum, Happy Baby that she didnapost want to hang around there any longer than she had to. Asked how long she had between giving birth and posing on the Lindo Wing steps, Kate said: Oh my gosh, I can’t remember. Everything goes in a bit of a blur. I think, yeah I did stay in hospital overnight, I remember it was one of the hottest days and night with huge thunderstorms so I didn’t get a huge amount of sleep, but George did which was really great. I was keen to get home because, for me, being in hospital, I had all the memories of being in hospital because of being sick so it wasn’t a place I wanted to hang around in.  So, I was really desperate to get home and get back to normality. Kate opened up about her dficult pregnancies saying she felt utterly rotten during all three. She said: It was fine. I got very bad morning sickness, so I’m not the happiest of pregnant people.  "},{"url":null,"title":"woman creates life saving sleeping","story":"w.mantis  Woman creates le-saving sleeping bags for

The -metre MV Alta cargo ship, which is sailing with a Tanzanian flag, was spotted in Ballycotton, County Cork, by a local on Sunday morning.A spokesman for the Waterford Coast Guard told the Irish Examiner the shipaposs current location was a result of the storm and they had checked it and found no one on board.He also said the ship was not polluting the area. Ballycotton RNLI Leboat Operations manager John Tattan said: This is one in a million. It has come all the way up from the African coast, west of the Spanish coast, west of the English coast and up to the Irish coast. I have never, ever seen anything abandoned like that before. Mr Tattan said it was a wonder how it had not been detected by one of the fishing vessels off the south coast beforehand. Mystery surrounds how the cargo ship, built in , ended up floating around the Atlantic Ocean without anyone on board.  Last September it was reported that the UK Royal Navyaposs Devonport-based HMS Protector had spotted it Mid-Atlantic. The ship was also spotted , miles southeast of Bermuda with  crew on board in September . It is believed the crew were rescued.

Paul Hartley played him further back in front of me and whoever I was partnering but I always felt he was more of a threat further up the pitch.“He creates real problems for defenders because they don’t know whether to follow him when he naturally drops back.“What Gowser does is take real care of the ball when he’s got it and he turns and can see a pass.“The ball he played through for Kane Hemmings’ second goal had to be right and he set the goal up.“I was delighted with Gowser up front and with Kane next to him.”With striking options limited following Danny Johnson’s departure in January and Andrew Nelson’s surgery, James says that plan would have been put to use the previous week against Morton.However, a knock picked up in training ruled McGowan out of the draw at Cappielow.And it was sporting director Gordon Strachan who reminded the Dark Blues manager of the possibility.McGowan started his career at Celtic while Strachan was manager at Parkhead and was given his debut in an advanced position.James added: “It’s something we would have done earlierwe could have.“We probably would have done it at Morton.“He started his career out there.

He had to fight three times, beating last year’s Scottish champion in the semis.“He lost to him in the final of the Northern District Championships but a silver from that is still very good.“He was a bit disappointed but that’s the way it goes sometimes.“Brendan did really well to win the Northern District. He had to fight twice against a couple of tough boys.”Howett feels all his young stars can aspire to reach the heights of former Lochee greats Billy Buchanan, Ronnie Clark and Mike Towell.“Luca used to do gymnastics, which was a bit of a help when he first came but he’s took to the movement in boxing really well.“We’ve got high hopes for him going forward. He could win the Scottish Open Championships at the end of the month.“Luca’s dedication is good and Brendan will get up in the morning to go running and look after his diet.“Brendan’s in for the Senior Open Championships in March, which is a big one because it counts towards being picked for the Commonwealth Games squad in .“He went last year and did well in his first season as a senior so he’s hoping to go one better.“We’ve had Sam, who’s full-time with Boxing Scotland and has went on to earn European medals and win the British Championships, so he’s progressing well.“It’s good to see them taking their chances and there’s more talent to come – Ali Mahmood, Logan Howett and Lennon Mitchell for example. vw, px\"  “Sam is travelling all over now.

It’s a good place for the kids to come up and get involved, you try to give everyone a chance.“We had a young boy who came up with really severe autism, he was just  and came up on his own but he’s was here for a couple of years now and it helped him loads.“Sometimes I felt like walking away because it’s tough and a big commitment but I love it too much.“It started up again with my brother Andy and I running it, travelling all over Scotland and the UK to tournaments just to get the boys fights.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this. Young people like her give me hope for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"john-muir-house-car-park-opened-public","story":"The car park, off Court Street, is home to about  spaces but can only be used by council employees and council HQ visitors between am and pm during the working week.That could soon change, with a number of spaces potentially being made available for public weekday daytime use.The idea comes as the council looks to increase the overall number of short and long stay car parking spaces in and around the town centre.Last year, discussions took place with members of the public surrounding the idea of creating a lsquotransport hubrsquo off the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.Now, a further two-day consultation is taking place in Haddington Town House, when members of the public can discuss parking issues in the town.The consultation will focus on parking throughout Haddington, including possibly changing the long-stay car park near the townrsquos Tesco store into a short-stay car park.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoFor many years, wersquove been keen to enhance the town centre so that it offers the best possible environment for all users ndash including people with restricted mobility, pedestrians and cyclists ndash to ensure easy access to the local services and businesses on which Haddington depends.ldquoAs well as improved options for active travel and public transport, we recognise there is a need to create more parking spaces in and around the town centre.ldquoFor this to happen, we need to change some existing parking from long stay to short stay, and deliver a new long-stay parking option for drivers who need to leave their vehicle in the town throughout the working day.ldquoOne proposal is the potential re-designation of the existing lsquoTesco long-stayrsquo car park, which could free up an additional  spaces in the town centre for short-stay, public parking.ldquoWe will also review the status of the car park at John Muir House, East Lothian Councilrsquos head office, to consider the potential for an area here to be available for wider public use.More than  people attended the previous exhibition in the Town House.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes.

Peatlands are renowned for their ability to soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, to promote bioersity and to provide high quality water.The Thurso-based scientists will benefit from access to the Flow Country, the largest blanket bog in Europe and a region that is under consideration for World Heritage Site status ndash joining the ranks of Australiarsquos Great Barrier Reef, the Grand Canyon in America and the Taj Mahal in India.The project will also support new initiatives across the universityrsquos research centres and foster national and international collaborations, including work with Canadian peatland research groups.Dr Andersen said: ldquoPeatlands are the Earthrsquos most efficient terrestrial carbon store.

The team will explore how environmental conditions can affect Sphagnum mosses, one of the building blocks of peat in blanket bog.They will continue to develop a method that uses satellite data to measure how the seasonal patterns of swelling and shrinking of bog surface, known as ldquobog breathing, change in response to climate extremes and restoration activities.

Wersquove got the -bed hospital, the home of the medical school, wersquove got the universityrsquos research home here itrsquos already a melting pot of amazing people and amazing work, said Ms Stamp.She added: ldquoBioQuarter can be a lot more again and that is the transformational vision we have: to take BioQuarter today and its amazing attributes and put it on to the global path, to expand signicantly in terms of its numbers, in terms of who we attract, the types of innovators we want to attract.An architect by training, Ms Stamp said the scheme under development will include all the elements of a good place.ldquoIt will be a place where people want to work, to play, to discover hellip we train the next generation of doctors here, the next generation of innovators so we want to attract the absolute best students, so a place where you would want to spend your seven yearrsquos training.The plan should provide a signicant boost to the regeneration of south-east Edinburgh, with improved transport links and job opportunities for local people in prospect.A lot of work is being done to build links with the local community. Ms Stamp is keen to ensure that school children in nearby Craigmillar are encouraged to feel they could become one of the innovators working at the BioQuarter.She believes its expansion will help reinforce Scotlandrsquos reputation as a centre of innovation in the healthcare sphere and further support the development of the le sciences sector in the country.ldquoScotland has always punched above its weight when it comes to medical innovation right up to today. Itrsquos not just the Simpsons and Listers and people of the past, itrsquos the work thatrsquos coming out of the research just now, itrsquos amazing and BioQuarter has played and will continue to play a really critical role in that.By having a major hospital, research and business facilities in close proximity, BioQuarter helps secure advances in medical science and healthcare and to support the effort to commercialise promising technology.The commercialisation centre is home to ten spin outs including contract research specialist Aquila BioMedical and there is demand for space from other businesses.Research giant buys stake in BioQuarter-based businessAs a senior member of the estates department at Edinburgh university Ms Stamp led work on research facilities that helped underline the potential of the BioQuarter, before being appointed in August to lead on the expansion plan.The buildings she worked on in her estates role include the poundm Centre for Regenerative Medicine.Ms Stamp previously led on the regeneration of the Easter Bush Campus, where the Roslin Institute and the universityrsquos vet school stand on what were muddy fields.Having worked in senior positions in the public and private sectors Ms Stamp is confident that both will benefit from the Bio Quarter.Launched in , the BioQuarter is backed by NHS Lothian, Edinburgh university, the City of Edinburgh Council and Scottish Enterprise, which brings le science business development expertise.Around pound million has been invested in facilities on the site or those that are under development.Ms Stamp believes the right private sector players could allow the expansion of the development to proceed on a scale and at a speed that the public sector on its own might not be able to match.Before starting work at Edinburgh university in , Ms Stamp spent six interesting years at employee-owned John Lewis which she describes as an amazing company.ldquoYou are a partner from day one, there was a sense of family, a sense that you belonged to the business and that it was yours that gave you an amazing grounding.After completing her architectural training with John Lewis, Ms Stamp rose to a position which meant she played an important part in the development of major new stores such as one in the giant Bluewater complex in Kent.She was pleased to be chosen to lead work on the redesign of the John Lewis branch in the old St James Centre in Edinburgh,  miles from her native North Berwick.That meant having a big influence on a building that family members and friends had shopped in for years.Ms Stamp thinks the huge St James Quarter development which is under way in Edinburgh represents a welcome improvement on the tired St James Centre which it will replace.As changes in the retail world mean centres that only house shops could face a struggle the inclusion of hotels should help underpin the viability of the St James Quarter development.Her work on the BioQuarter expansion means she could play a key role in the development of another project that leaves a lasting impression on the city of Edinburgh.Ms Stamp wants to remain involved in regeneration work in future. As a senior figure in the building world she hopes to make an impact in other ways. These include helping to ensure the construction industry gives women a fairer deal.ldquoI think the construction industry is really failing in how it promotes females hellip I can interview contractors all day and sometimes not a single female walks through the door.QAWhat countries have you most enjoyed travelling to, for business or leisure, and why Hong Kong ndash as part of my architecture course back in the rsquos I was able to live and work in Hong Kong for a year. With the vibrancy, colours, noise, smells, Hong Kong was a city that never slept and I loved every second of it. To live and work in another country changes your outlook and I would encourage anyone who gets the chance to take it.When you were a child, what was your ideal job  Why did it appeal I wanted to be an architect from a very early age, influenced heavily by my dad who had his own architectural practise in Leith, Edinburgh. Although architecture is about the built environment it is more about people ndash buildings are designed, built and lived in by people. As a child I watched my dad bring peoples ideas to reality and make a real dference to the way they lived.What was your biggest break in business I started off my career in the John Lewis Partnership as an architect in the late rsquos. The retail industry was changing rapidly at the time because of the recession and John Lewis embraced this with an ambitious programme of building large stores across the UK delivered in partnership with contractors and developers. This opened an avenue of opportunity for a rookie architect to be involved with and eventually lead large construction projects so early on in my career and learn the business of construction from both the client and investors perspective.What was your worst moment in business When you lead a project for it to be a success you have put your heart and soul into it. So when projects get scrapped it can be quite devastating. Sadly, this happens often in construction industry as funding is not secured or needs change. I am not sure it is something you ever get used to.Who do you most admire and why The architect Zaha Hadid who sadly died in  ndash she was the first woman to win a RIBA Royal Gold Medal in her own right. As a student we studied no female architects and during my career there have only been a few prominent female role models in architecture and construction.

Ministerrsquos Questions to ask Boris Johnsonhe would consider lsquoa change in the law to allow vulnerable addicts to consume substances in secure facilities under medical supervision.rsquoFor those not aware of such facilities, Sheppard is referencing the highly sought-after piloting of a supervised drug consumption facility .Supervised drug consumption facilities are places where illicit drugs can be used under the supervision of trained staff, who can intervene in the event of an overdose, and are typically used by people who inject drugs.:Charities want consumption room for drug users in GlasgowThe evidence has shown that the facilities reduce drug-related litter, connect users with health care professionals, save livesand reduce the spread of blood borne diseases, such as HIV and Hepatitis.The facilitation of an SDCF has been the subject of much controversy, with Scotland long pushing for the piloting of one to no avail.It was much to the surprise of some tuning in, therefore, that the question was not dismissed out of hand by Johnson.Instead, he pointed to an upcoming drug summit, due to be held in Scotland later this month.Few details about this summit have been revealed since then.What we do know is that it will be held in Glasgow on February , it will be chaired by the relevant minister Kit Malthouse, and that Professor Dame Carole Black, who is carrying out an independent review of drugs for the government, will be presenting her findings.It is not just the public, but the ruling party of Scotland and Glasgow Council who also seem to be in the dark about plans for the summit, with Holyrood Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick recently stating in an article published in The National that he is lsquovery surprised that the UK Government announced a summit in Glasgow without any consultation with the Scottish Government and Glasgow.rsquoWith relations between Westminster and Holyrood at a record low, and the lsquoyesrsquo vote once again on the rise, it seems the communication channels between the two government hubs have brokendown.:Westminster lsquostanding in the way of saving livesrsquo on Glasgow safe drug consumption roomPessimists might suggest that this indicates Scotland is no closer to the devolved drug powers it has long been seeking, which would allow for alternative policy approaches, such as a SDCF pilot in Glasgow.A recent UK government statement confirmed that it currently has no plans to introduce SDCFs.However, a few indicators suggest that this position could soonchange.The same statement goes on to say that ldquoillegal drugs devastate lives and communities and those who sell drugs will face the full consequences of the law.The emphasis on the lsquosellingrsquo of drugs implies that the government no longer sees the prosecution of drug users as a priority and will instead be going after the dealers.This approach could chime well with the public, with drug-related deaths at an all time high inScotland.A supervised consumption facility would allow the Tories to be lsquotough on crimersquo by pursuing drug dealers, but sympathetic to those in the throes of homelessness and addiction.Meanwhile, the drugs summit provides an opportunity for the Conservative government to better understand and respond effectively to the Scottish perspective and experience, demonstrating that the countryrsquos needs can be met within the union. Scotland has experienced record-high levels of drug-related deaths, with Glasgow city centre at the heart of it.From a policy perspective too, the move would be feasible.The political climate is ripe for such an announcement given the shocking levels of drug-related deaths. In addition, Johnson is barely two months into a five-year term with a huge majority so he can afford to adopt bold policy positions.The practicalities too should not pose many issues.Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership has been preparing for the introduction of a SDCF since  and the city is primed for implementation.With the summit taking place in a city renowned for anti-Tory sentiment and one of the epicentres of the current drug death crisis, it would be fitting for Glasgow to play host to the summit which could engineer the change of policy that the city has long been crying out for.At a time when the opposition party has lost all but one seat in Scotland, surely the strategy for the Tories must be to capitalise on the low hanging fruit and facilitate the piloting of live-saving safer drug consumption facilities Ant Lehane is Communications Officer of drug policy organisation Volteface.

Winter is a tough time for wild birds, but as spring approaches, and the weather becomes warmer, we should expect to hear more tweeting in our gardens.The company is asking keen photographers to share their snaps, with a chance to win a gt card for the store. Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March . All photographs should be taken in a garden or outdoor setting and must have been taken by you.Entries can be emailed to wildbirdcompetition@wearebrazenprcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt.

That is not good enough.“Ministers and mobile phone operators clearly agreed that public money was needed to plug existing gaps in the network. Since then, however, neither has been prepared to follow this up with action on the ground.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country.

It shows that people with detained relatives are themselves more likely to end up in a camp, criminalising entire families.ldquoItrsquos very clear that religious practice is being targeted, said Darren Byler, a University of Colorado researcher studying Xinjiang. ldquoThey want to fragment society, to pull the families apart and make them much more vulnerable to retraining and reeducation.Asked whether Xinjiang is targeting religious people and their families, Chinarsquos foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: ldquoThis kind of nonsense is not worth commenting on.The Chinese government has said in the past that the detention centres are for voluntary job training, and that it does not discriminate based on religion.China has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, where the native, predominantly Muslim Uighurs have long resented Beijingrsquos rule.

The list was corroborated through interviews with former Karakax residents, identity verication tools, and other lists and documents.The database shows that cadres compile dossiers on detainees called the ldquothree circles, encompassing their relatives, community, and religious background.The detainees and their families are then classied by rigid categories. Households are designated as ldquotrustworthy or ldquonot trustworthy. Families have ldquolight or ldquoheavy religious atmospheres, and the database keeps count of how many relatives of each detainee are locked in prison or sent to a ldquotraining centre.Officials used these categories to determine how suspicious a person was ndash eventhey had not committed any crimes.copy -.

As they did so, they reflected on the good times, and lamented the waste.The last to plant his cross was Steven Currie. Steven’s older brother Peter McGrattan – known to most as Big Ped – was obsessed by music. “He was into punk when he was a boy, then U, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses, Oasis,” says Steven, who has the word “Brother” tattooed on his arm. “He was the man for the music, and you would follow suit because you looked up to him.” Steven would sit on the floor while Peter played DJ. “I’d tap tap my feet and think: ‘That’s quite good, that.’ His taste was superb. He could have been one of those guys that spotted bands.”But Big Ped carried a bit of weight and it affected his self-esteem. He trod that well-worn path from alcohol through soft drugs, heroin and crack cocaine, on to the grave. He died of a Valium overdose, after eight years clean, in August , dying in their mother’s house. “The paramedic came in and said: ‘He’s gone,’” Steven says. “I sat with him on the floor and cuddled him until they came and took him away.” Gone, but still loved still remembered.We are in the grip of a drugs deaths emergency here in Scotland, as everybody knows. Our drugs death rate is the worst in Europe. The toll for  was , – the highest it has ever been. It will come as little surprisethis year’s is higher still. The crosses are a reminder that each of the , was an inidual robbed of their future.En masse, they capture the scale of the problem. Spread out in rows like war graves, they say: “Here is a generation being wiped out, while those at the top play politics.” Is this too harsh  Maybe. Yet even as Steven placed his cross, the UK and Scottish governments were squabbling over rival drugs summits to be held in Glasgow a day apart. “My drugs summit is better than your drugs summit,” they blustered like children.Of course, politicians on both sides can justy their position. The UK government will say it announced its conference first. “But without consulting us, and without including those with lived experience,” the Scottish Government will counter. If either party does not understand how pathetic it sounds – how pathetic it is – for two governments who share responsibility for drugs policy to be unwilling to cut the crap and share a table, I suggest they get out of politics for a while and look at this from beyond the bubble. I suggest they spend some time in those communities where people are losing their lives for want of inter-agency collaboration and a coherent policy.This is not to suggest the Scottish Government is doing nothing. Last year – under pressure, and having previously cut frontline services – it set up the Drugs Deaths Task Force. In the recent budget it announced an extra £.m to be spent on “delivering innovative projects, testing new approaches and developing a national pathway for opiate substitute therapy”.The Scottish Government conference will also provide training in the use of Naloxone, which reverses the effect of drugs overdoses, and a demonstration model of a drugs consumption room. It insists what takes place there will “inform” its contribution to the UK summit the next day. And yet the mutual blame game neither side appears able to stop does not augur well.So often we hear about successful policy where, particularly in Portugal where drugs have been decriminalised, users have been de-stigmatised and those who consume can choose between harm reduction and rehab.But the key to Portugal’s success was not merely the approach itself, but the political consensus that formed around it and an unshakeable commitment to that approach through successive governments.Here in the UK, we are still treating drugs policy like a political football a forum for the airing of grievances a battleground for ideological dferences. This was happening long before the general election, but it is worse now the Tories have a thumping majority.The destructive relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Government – and more specically between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson – is spilling into other areas too, most notably the COP climate conference which will take place in Glasgow in November.This conference is supposed to build the coalition necessary to break the deadlock on international climate action – and therefore requires UK-wide co-operation and a gt for diplomacy.Already, however, it has been reduced to oneupmanship. Despite being advised otherwise, Johnson has refused to give Sturgeon any formal role in proceedings. And there have been disputes over the venue itself. With the conference set to be held in the Scottish Events Campus on the north of the river, the Scottish Government booked out the Science Centre on the south. But now the UK government says it needs both sites and has accused the Scottish Government of trying to undermine its plans. To make matters worse, the Prime Minister is said to have referred to Sturgeon as “that wee Jimmy Krankie woman” to which Sturgeon responded “ Boris Johnson wants to make personal insults against me, I’m a big enough girl to make personal insults back”. All highly constructive.I think most of us accept Johnson would try the patience of a saint. As last week’s reshuffle demonstrated, he – or rather Dominic Cummings – is hell-bent on exercising control. Claire Perry claims he sacked her as the president of the COP and replaced her with former international development secretary Alok Sharma because Whitehall couldn’t cope with an independent conference. Sharma is said to have a questionable record on environment issues.Given all this, it must be tempting to answer criticism by pointing out that “Johnson started this” and that he is a twat of the highest order. But that gets us nowhere. Meanwhile, the planet burns.Aware, presumably, that tit-for-tat fighting is destructive and childish, Sturgeon has called for a reset in relations. But for that to happen, the UK government will not only have to be willing to co-operate on key issues, the Scottish Government will have to stop constantly passing the buck southwards.The constitutional debate is not going to disappear. Both governments will be arguing over the legitimacy of a second independence referendum for some time. But they need to be able to set that argument aside when it comes to shared crises such as drugs deaths and climate change.Only by attempting to find common ground can progress be made. If that requires pride to be swallowed, and teeth to be gritted, then so be it. There are too many crosses already in Springburn too many species already extinct. Enough with the playground politics.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm nuisance neighbour sajid javid feels smack of firm leadership","story":"The Prime Minister#s predecessors would have understood his demand for unquestioning loyalty from the Treasury, writes Euan McColmIt was greeted as evidence of a crisis at the very heart of government.When Sajid Javid resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer on Thursday, after rejecting Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s demand that he sack all of his advisers, opponents scented blood.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell observed that Johnson had “clearly won the battle to take absolute control of the Treasury and install his stooge as chancellor”. We must surely, he added, be witnessing a historical record – a government in crisis after just two months in power.Meanwhile, Labour-supporting commentators lined up to explain the replacement of Javid with, as one columnist described him, the “alarmingly obedient” Rishi Sunak.I’m bound to say that for a man mired in crisis, Johnson appears remarkably relaxed. When he and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, told Javid they wanted his team cleared out and replaced by a new staff of advisers working across both  and  Downing Street, they must have know there was a chance – a good one, at that – that the chancellor wouldn’t wear it. His decision to walk cannot have come as a shock.McDonnell’s description of a government in crisis is, I’m afraid, inaccurate. Rather, what we’re seeing is a Prime Minister fully in control. There is no crisis.In Javid’s eager beaver replacement, Johnson has precisely what he wanted: a compliant chancellor who will do what he desires.Quite why Sunak’s loyalty should be seen as “alarming”, I’m not sure. There is nothing in the rule book of politics that says the sign of a good chancellor is a willingness to defy the prime minister. Was Tony Blair’s Labour government improved by the fact chancellor Gordon Brown spent his every waking moment seething with resentment over his rival’s supremacy  No, it wasn’t, was it  In fact, briefing and counter-briefing by Number  and Treasury sources meant the fractured relationship between prime minister and chancellor frequently got in the way of smooth government. When both men would rather have seen their policy agenda make headlines, their bitter relationship became the focus of media attention.When, finally, Brown realised his ambition of becoming prime minister, he could not change his ways. A man born to plot, Brown soon began undermining his chancellor, Alistair Darling, destroying a professional and personal relationship that had endured for years.David Cameron and George Osborne entered government in  having learned from their predecessors. Relations between Downing Street and the Treasury were good for the first time in a long time.Cameron and Osborne were a team and they always understood the pecking order. Each got what he needed from the relationship.But Johnson has no such partner. The Prime Minister has no political soulmate.This being so, what, exactly is the problem with Johnson wishing to take a firm grip of the Treasury  It is, I think, the sort of thing that might look to voters like strong leadership. Few, I’d wager, now lament the passing of the Javid era.Among Johnson’s immediate priorities is solidying the Conservative vote in areas of England which once ed Labour MPs. The Prime Minister will want to deliver for areas in the Midlands and the North of England which went Tory for the first time in generations. If he does not make good on his promises of regeneration and investment then the PM risks watching those voters drt back to Labour.What Johnson needs, right now, is a chancellor who is completely on board with this agenda. But there is something  beyond the Prime Minister’s desire for a compliant chancellor at play, here. Johnson has just sent a message to every member of his parliamentary party that the rules of the game have changed. His demand is complete loyalty, nothing less.From what McDonnell describes as a crisis will, I think, spring a period of uncommon stability in government. Last year, Johnson won the parliamentary majority he craved. Now, he has stamped his authority on his party in no uncertain terms.This same message came across loudly and clearly in Johnson’s dismissal from his cabinet of former leadership contenders Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey. Leadsom is a popular figure among members of the Tory Party’s Eurosceptic right wing. Johnson’s calculation is that he need not concern himself with the feelings of those members. Javid comes out of the last few days rather well, I think. No chancellor can complain about a demand for loyalty but the order to dismiss his team of advisers was a step too far, one provocation too many.That Javid said no to this suggests he has something about him, after all.In a statement following his resignation, the former chancellor reiterated his support for Johnson. I wonder how long this will last.It is undoubtedly the case that when political parties lose discipline, they lose elections. Look at the SNP. For decades, they did nothing but tear each other apart over the best way in which independence might be achieved. Bitter recrimination was part and parcel of SNP membership. And then Alex Salmond ed as party leader for a second stint and he laid down the bloody law to his colleagues. There was to be no briefing about colleagues, no criticism of government policy, and no public disagreement over any of the party’s positions.What followed was as period of unity in the SNP ranks that continues – the occasional domestic disturbance, aside – to this day.I’m not sure Johnson is behaving especially dferently to the way Salmond did. Doubtless, opposition parties will taunt Chancellor Rishi Sunak when he next rises to speak in the House of Commons. They will leave him in no doubt that they consider him a poodle.But each and every one of Boris Johnson’s opponents will privately admire the way he strengthened his grip on the Tory Party last week.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

After a spirited campaign by his opponent Michelle Ballantyne, Carlaw in the end won comfortably with a % to % share of the members’ votes cast. The party should be thankful to Ballantyne for ensuring there was a contest, not least for allowing Carlaw to now say with authority he has an unequivocal mandate to run the party. She also gave voice to concerns that have been building up over recent years about party management. Carlaw will surely want to address these rather than exacerbate them. While the candidates did their best to present themselves as dferent and thus offer a genuine choice, the reality is they had far more in common than what ided them. For the party this is a good thing as members now have to unite behind Carlaw’s leadership and turn their attention to the most important challenge facing them – defeating the SNP in the  elections.Their first goal will be to prevent the SNP having an overall majority like that won by Alex Salmond in , but then lost by Nicola Sturgeon in . Despite the appalling performance of our public services under the management of the SNP government, recent polling suggests it could yet win such a huge mandate. While possible I think it unlikely, for once the electorate begins to consider the SNP’s record in detail its failure must begin to pay idends for the opposition. Also fundamental to the debate is how the dominance of Brexit will recede, allowing more oxygen to be given to the scrutinising the performance of SNP ministers.The second goal must then be to lay the ground for a new administration that locks the SNP out of government evenSturgeon wins the most seats. An alternative minority administration that enjoys a comfort and supply arrangement would be the most likely route – as neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats will want to even hint at a coalition, never mind formalise one. In an effort to kill-off such a prospect the SNP will seek to demonise any party offering to work with dreaded Tories – or “Tory Scum” as the infamous banner that graces nationalist marches brands over half a million Scottish voters. In response the argument has to be put that it was the Tories who provided a comfort and supply arrangement to Salmond and Sturgeon between -. If the Tories were good enough for the SNP then, why should it not be good enough for Carlaw to do the same with other partiesit’s best for the for the country It is impossible to say what role the Labour Party will play in all of these developments too much depends on how its UK leadership election works out, but there are other encouraging signs that offer hope to unionists. Yesterday Scottish Business UK, the pro-Union business group backed by hundreds of Scottish businesses and including many household names, published a new paper advocating a more positive and assertive approach by the UK government. Included in the paper Strengthening the Union: A Framework for Business Success were proposals for a UK Department of the Union which would have grant-aiding powers to assist directly initiatives that will help the UK’s cohesiveness. These might be community based or infrastructure projects – but they would clearly demonstrate and say on the tin they have been delivered by the UK.Other ideas included an Office for Budget Responsibility for the Union that would bring more transparency to encourage both accountability and value for money in public spending. Interestingly it is argued the new OBR could become a force for helping achieve UK-wide spending commitments in Scotland as well challenging them. The paper also considered issues from taxation to fisheries, cultural exchange within the UKto migration. Some may fly, others probably will not, but the fact that a business group is bringing forward positive ideas that can add value to being in the UK illustrates how the UK’s status quo is never set in stone.Indeedthere is one dference why the UK’s advocates won the independence referendum of  but the Europhiles lost that of  is the UK is evolving and decentralising by devolving power out to nations and cities – whereas the EU is taking more and more power for itself. Other unionist organisations are also stirring Scotland in Union, the largest campaign group defending the Union launched a Valentine video message last week and another offering ten reasons Scotland is stronger in the UK. That might not seem especially unusualbut the adoption of a positive rather than negative tone represents a change in approach away from the project fear of the past and, I believe, will begin to pay idends. Likewise the meetings being organised around the country by the unionist lobbying group Scotland Matters demonstrates the level of activism outside party circles is growing. True, such events are not at the levels of Yes activism, but that’s not the appropriate comparison, the point is no such activities were even being considered by unionists before the last referendum in . This time Unionists of all parties or none are mobilising in advance of the  elections to head off nationalism before any referendum.Later this weekend in Newcastle-upon-Tyne the discussion forum “These Islands” holds a two day conference to explores issues of culture and identity that are rarely given enough thought by unionists.The growth of such activities points to a more confident and less complacent approach from unionists be they large or small “U”. It shows a willingness to do grown-up politics, to have adult and reasoned debate away from the obscenities and hatred spouted at marches, worn on T-shirts and sprayed across social media that too many nationalists have descended into.All of Scotland’s pro-British parties can tap into this new wave of unionist optimism – and then maybe learn to work together.Brian Monteith is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"mps who make the most from side jobs as downing st weighs up bbc speech ban","story":"Downing Streets multi-frontal effort to cut the BBC down to size,#revealed in the#Sunday Times, includes a plan to ban presenters from \"cashing in\" with external work such as speeches.Kamal Ahmed, the BBCs director of news, was found to have earned £, from addressing a conference and forced to repay the money.\"It’s an outrage that people who make their profile at public expense should seek to give themselves further financial rewards and personal gain,\" the source said. \"They’re basically making their names on the taxpayer and then cashing in.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2741091.jpg--.jpg?1581502849000\n","title":"toll bar dancing club steps out for burns night","story":"A  strong crowd put their best foot forward to attend the Toll Bar Dancing Club at the end of January to celebrate Burns Night.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"council apologise after grave mistake","story":"BELFAST City Council has had to apologise to a recently bereaved family after ly informing them that a stranger was buried in their loved one’s grave.Last week, Council officials told the West Belfast family they could not bury their relative alongside her mother as there was an additional person interred in the burial plot.A grieving family member spoke of her family’s trauma when, as they prepared for her sister-in-law’s funeral last week, Belfast City Council insisted that another woman had been buried in the grave since .“My brother was insistent that this was a new plot, only opened in  when his mother-in-law died but the ‘spokesperson’ in City Hall was also insistent that they were right and their records are never wrong,” she explained.“After nearly an hour of stress and annoyance my brother had a brainwave that the new plot his mother-in-law was in didn’t exist in .“The graves at the new plots at the very top of City Cemetery didn’t date back that far.”Following an investigation it was revealed that Belfast City Council had mistaken the family grave for another after mixing up the plots.“My poor, grieving brother who had lost his we just hours before was left totally wrung out and traumatised – I was the same,” the bereaved woman said.“No apology from City Hall whatsoever just a bit of a ‘d’oh’ moment and ‘oh human error’ – not good enough!“Whoever is inputting these statistics and grave co-ordinates needs to be checked and rechecked to make sure this type of incident doesn’t happen again.“City Hall need to remember they are dealing with bereaved people and desperately need to show a bit more compassion when dealing with these types of things.”The woman accused Belfast City Council of passing “the buck on to the ordinary, bereaved families”.“The administrative side of Belfast City Hall reeks of laziness, incompetency and pure lack of compassion and I expect some sort of reply”.This is the second time Belfast City Council has had to apologise to a bereaved family in as many weeks.Last week, the Andersonstown News reported how council officials apologised after sending a letter to a deceased woman asking her to repair her own headstone.Commenting on its latest blunder, a Belfast City Councilspokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for any distress caused to the family. When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

We need to stop disregarding the importance of human rights and we need to think about how we tackle sectarianism.”Mr Nesbitt said one of the most effective ways to tackle sectarianism would be the creation of a single education system.“If you are mixing children from the ages of three or four every day you are giving them an inoculation against sectarianism.“Andwe can tackle sectarianism we can tackle one of the most toxic legacies of our Troubles.”There is \"a long legacy of sectarian decision making\" in Northern Ireland\" - Dr Robbie McVeigh, who is launching his new research report, Sectarianism: The Key Facts, at Stormont today. He argues for the effective equality proofing of decisions going forwards. pic UhoPCwzAE— EqualityCoalitionFebruary , The -page report was penned by independent researcher Dr Robbie McVeigh.Dr McVeigh said there was a need to consider the problem in the context of Northern Ireland’s changing demographic landscape.He said the region was no longer characterised by a Protestant majority and Catholic minority and was instead a place of “three minorities” – Protestant, Catholic and increasing number who identy as neither.He said disparities between Protestants and Catholics still existed in many areas across the public sector – expressing particular concern about stalled efforts to make the PSNI more representative of the community it serves.He urged authorities in Northern Ireland to learn from an initiative undertaken by former prime minister Theresa May when she ordered an audit of all government departments to establish areas where racial disparities existed.Dr McVeigh said departments were then challenged to either explain the disparities or take action to address them. vw,vw,px, px\"Declan Kearney said sectarianism was the ‘elephant in the room’ across society in the region Stormont Junior Minister Declan Kearney also addressed the event.

Many of the pupils at Ballougry PS have a family link to the school and children come from as far afield as Eglinton and Donemana to be educated there.We have children whose parents, grandparents and even great grandparents have been at the school.The parents have such fond memories of their time here that they want their children to enjoy the same type of education, no matter where they are living.Mr OKane believes that attending a small primary school equips children well for the transition to secondary school.In a small school setting you have to get on well with everyone and the children thrive on it.In bigger schools you can jump around friendship groupsthings arent working out, but here you just have to work it out.We were very happy with out recent transfer test results and our children will be moving on to every post primary school in the city.”Mr OKane concluded: The feedback that we always get is that the children really do represent us well.Among the schools best known past pupils is renowned actress, Amanda Burton, well known for her television roles, including Heather Black in the Channel  soap opera Brookside, Beth Glover in Peak Practice, Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series Silent Witness, Clare Blake in The Commander and Karen Fisher in Waterloo Road.Her father was a headmaster at the school. googletag.cmd.push Photos: Tom Heaney   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an ‘Embrace the Giant Spirit’ event organised by Tourism NI, actors Stephen Rea, Tara Lynne O’Neill and Laurence Kinlan, musician Neil Martin and the singer-songwriter Lisa Hannigan, gave a unique and moving performance to celebrate Seamus Heaney’s work at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin.The programme was curated by Seamus Heaney HomePlace, the literary centre in Bellaghy, Co Derry, which takes visitors on a journey through the le and literature of the poet, with an invited audience including members of the Heaney family, representatives from the local tourism industry as well as arts, culture and media.The performers came together as part of an initiative which aims to highlight the literary connections between Seamus Heaney HomePlace, which recently reached its , visitor milestone, and the hugely successful ‘Listen Now Again’ exhibition, which draws on the National Library’s extensive Heaney archive and has welcomed over , visitors since it opened in Dublin in July .Featuring powerful performances of Seamus Heaney’s work, including an adaptation in words and music of an excerpt of Aeneid: Book VI and a haunting performance of Anahorish by Lisa Hannigan, the event comes as HomePlace prepares to extend its visitor experience into the landscape which so inspired the poet and which features in his work.A total of  locations of signicance to Seamus Heaney are being developed, notable among them being Lough Beg a place of ‘special memories’ for the poet where a boardwalk will lead visitors to a newly constructed viewing point to see Church Island and its famous spire, with extracts of poetry audible, as well as visible along the route. A riverside walk by the Moyola River is also being created and a newly commissioned sculpture will form the focal point for visitors to hear and read poetry at the eel fishery in Toome. Visitors will also be able to download an app, which will allow access to augmented reality as they journey through each location.Fiona Cunningham, RoI Market Manager for Tourism NI said, “With the impressive Seamus Heaney HomePlace, situated in Bellaghy, only two and a half hours from Dublin, visitors can really immerse themselves in our greatest poet’s writing and discover many areas of his beloved hometown that inspired so much of his work.“Over , thousand have visited the Dublin exhibition since it opened in , and many may be unaware of the very unique and spiritually moving experience one can also get when visiting Heaney HomePlace. Visitors are coming from all over the world to soak up the beautul place, people and landscapes in Northern Ireland that inspired him so much and we want to encourage people from across Ireland to make the unforgettable trip to follow his journey, walk the paths he took and explore through his words at Seamus Heaney HomePlace. We are really inviting you to embrace our giant spirit in NI and to awaken your own.”HomePlace also recently opened its new Tourism NI approved Visitor Information Centre, offering a range of new services for visitors to learn about further immersive activities, places to visit and stay in the area. Chris Heaney, son of Seamus Heaney, said: “It’s a pleasure to be here this evening to celebrate Seamus Heaney HomePlace and to highlight its outstanding events programme of readings, concerts and performances”.Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Martin Kearney, commented, “We in Bellaghy and Dublin share our custodianship of a signicant legacy and this evening HomePlace has been very pleased to be curating here, sharing also a taste of the experience our visitors have in our performance space.“We hope that we will continue, inidually and collectively, to celebrate all our writers and the great literary talent which has emerged from this island. There is a momentum building across Ireland and an opportunity for us to create a cultural tourism network across the entire landscape, North to South, East to West, where we and our visitors can embrace a ‘giant literary spirit’”.Brian McCormick, manager of HomePlace said: “We want to extend our sincere thanks to Tourism NI for hosting such a special evening and for continuing to highlight the incredible opportunities there are, through HomePlace and Listen Now Again, for visitors to engage with and be inspired by Seamus Heaney and his work”.

At a meeting of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s Health and Community Committee, Derry councillors said it is adding to the “reputational damage” of the care home. In November , the centre reopened to new admissions following a string of unsatisfactory inspections dating back to May. The privately owned centre based on the Culmore Road is an -bed facility which cares for people with dementia, learning disabilities and mental disorders. It was under enforcement after the health regulator, RQIA, took court action in August. googletag.cmd.push An investigation by health watchdog RQIA in May of last year identied “serious concerns” in relation to the quality of management and governance arrangements in the home, health and welfare of patients, in particular the record keeping, and the competency and capability of registered nursing staff. RQIA obtained a court order in August to block new admissions after it emerged the Western Trust was still referring patients to the home. During that time a respite unit for adults with learning disabilities, also based at Owen Mor, remained closed because it was registered as a single nursing home. That adversely affected both users and their families. googletag.cmd.push Owen Mor had been invited to attend a council meeting in January to address local councillors concerns but said it turned that down “owing to Owen Mor work commitments”. Representatives were instead invited to the care centre to discuss matters. The reason provided was described as “unsettling” by councillors who then extended another invitation to the registered accountable person at the home, Dr Una McDonald, at a date of her choosing. At Thursday’s meeting, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney asked for an update. A council official informed him that a response was provided on February  noting councillors’ views and comments, and the care centre made clear it would “not be in a position to accept any invitation in the near future.” But councillors were again given the option to meet at Owen Mor. ‘Disappointing’ In response, Cllr Tierney said: “It appears that Owen Mor is again refusing point blank to come before council to address concerns that have been ongoing for months.” He added that the meeting should not happen behind closed doors but in a public forum and believed another letter would be a “waste of time”. Independent Cllr Gary Donnelly said Owen’s Mor’s refusal to attend has inflicted further “reputational damage” on the organisation as it should be eager to “defend its position”. “It’s obvious they’re not going to come, asking a dozen councillors to come to a care home, I don’t think that’s appropriate. That’s leading to more concerns.” Alderman Maurice Devenney of the DUP said it was “disappointing” that senior management at the home haven’t taken up the invitation. If they don’t answer concerns, “how are we going to know it won’t happen again ” he asked. Addressing the meeting again, Cllr Tierney said it was important to note that some families have had no issues at Owen Mor, and it’s important to keep an open mind, but he questioned why an organisation “receiving public funds won’t come to council”. Alliance Cllr Rachael Ferguson enquired whether a meeting at Owen Mor could be minutedthat was the only option open to representatives. “It’s quite evident they don’t see themselves answerable to council,” Independent Cllr Paul Gallagher said. He proposed inviting Commissioner for Older People in NI, Eddie Lynch, before the committee to hear their concerns which in turn “might make Owen Mor take heed”. That proposal was seconded by Cllr Donnelly and supported by other members and the invitation to Owen Mor was left on the table.

A council official informed him that a response was provided on February  noting councillors’ views and comments, and the care centre made clear it would “not be in a position to accept any invitation in the near future.” But councillors were again given the option to meet at Owen Mor. ‘Disappointing’ In response, Cllr Tierney said: “It appears that Owen Mor is again refusing point blank to come before council to address concerns that have been ongoing for months.” He added that the meeting should not happen behind closed doors but in a public forum and believed another letter would be a “waste of time”. Independent Cllr Gary Donnelly said Owen’s Mor’s refusal to attend has inflicted further “reputational damage” on the organisation as it should be eager to “defend its position”. “It’s obvious they’re not going to come, asking a dozen councillors to come to a care home, I don’t think that’s appropriate. That’s leading to more concerns.” Alderman Maurice Devenney of the DUP said it was “disappointing” that senior management at the home haven’t taken up the invitation. If they don’t answer concerns, “how are we going to know it won’t happen again ” he asked. Addressing the meeting again, Cllr Tierney said it was important to note that some families have had no issues at Owen Mor, and it’s important to keep an open mind, but he questioned why an organisation “receiving public funds won’t come to council”. Alliance Cllr Rachael Ferguson enquired whether a meeting at Owen Mor could be minutedthat was the only option open to representatives. “It’s quite evident they don’t see themselves answerable to council,” Independent Cllr Paul Gallagher said. He proposed inviting Commissioner for Older People in NI, Eddie Lynch, before the committee to hear their concerns which in turn “might make Owen Mor take heed”. That proposal was seconded by Cllr Donnelly and supported by other members and the invitation to Owen Mor was left on the table.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

The Tobermore-born former footballer’s death was announced by the Harry Gregg Foundation on Monday and local MLA John Dallat paid tribute to the County Derry man. He said: “Harry Gregg was a selfless giant. Despite his incredible talent and success, he remained a down-to-earth gent. “He was a wonderful role model for our young people. Harry did nothing but project a positive image for our area and for that we are extremely grateful. “I wish to offer my deepest sympathy to his family.” Gregg was a survivor of the  Munich air disaster, in which  people lost their lives, where he twice ed to the burning wreckage to help both team-mates and strangers, including a -month old baby and her pregnant mother. googletag.cmd.push Just  days after the tragedy, the goalkeeper lined up in a - victory for the Red Devils over Sheffield Wednesday, in a remarkable act of courage and resilience.

The footballer had been working as a carpenter before the world of professional football beckoned, combining woodwork with spells playing for Linfield and Coleraine in the Irish league.

Perhaps his finest moment in the green jersey came months after the Munich air disaster, when he starred for his country in the  World Cup. Gregg helped Northern Ireland reach the last eight of the competition and was later named the best keeper at the tournament. He was awarded an OBE in the  New Year Honours list and leaves behind a legacy that highlights his dedication to the grassroots game. In a statement on their Facebook page, the Harry Gregg Foundation said: “It is with great sorrow that we inform of the death of Manchester United and Northern Ireland legend Harry Gregg, OBE. “Harry passed away peacefully in hospital surrounded by his loving family. “The Gregg family would like to thank the medical staff at Causeway Hospital for their wonderful dedication to Harry over his last few weeks. “To everyone who has called, visited or sent well wishes we thank you for the love and respect shown to Harry and the family.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year, there’s an incredible line-up for you to celebrate International Womens Day - on the bill there’sThe Henry Girls, Blackbird  Crow, Reevah,Blood,Great White Lies andTara Giwith comperes for the evening Madonna Kebab and Thran Leeann, with the night ening with some tunes fromThe Stray Kitten.All that for pound in Sandino’s on Saturday, March .But, before that, on Saturday next, February , in the Gasyard, Blood’s Noella Hutton will be launching her new album.Noella doesn’t need an introduction, but for those of you who have never been outside she has had some of the best adventures of any of Derry’s musicians. “My first experiences of live music were of my sister, Jeanette, singing around the house,” she says, being inspired herself to moving to London to pursue her career, like many other musicians from Derry.She was signed to music superpower Universal Records in the late s, went to America, recorded her first album in the Record Plant in Sausalito, Calornia, where Rumours by Fleetwood Mac was made and took to the daily grind of constant gigging of being a working musician. Her follow-up album was made in Santa Monica and she came back to Derry in . She has consistently been writing and she promises anewalbum isn’t too far away. Really, really close actually. Solo album number three, is out on the nd.Have ye totally abandoned Jeanette or what’s the craic  googletag.cmd.push “I hate her phahahaha, naw, we still do the odd Blood gig. Theres just nowhere interested in doing original gigs. BennIgans is probably the only place that does. Wherever my album takes me Blood will go too. Jeanette is my best friend, my big sister, my greatest influence in every way, and we havethe same dark sense of humour. phahahaha very important!”Following your Facebook page, is there anyone you haven’t met  “To me, these people were powerful from a distance. Get them up close and sit with them theyre all just ordinary and winging it like the rest of us. Some of the loveliest folk I met where Sarah McLaughlin and Boy George. Theres a few more and a few that were very disappointing. Ill leave the details for another time.” googletag.cmd.push Tell us about recording the album… “Ive known Justin Black for  yearss. Hes been one of the only people besides ourJeanette that really cared and pushed me out of my depression.He has been annoying me for years to do an album for me. I can safely say hes one of the most talented,selfless... annoying... and extremely loyal friends Ive ever had. We have much to do.”This would be the time and place to mention that there won’t be a physical version of the album. If you were born before Nirvana that means there won’t be any vinyl or CDs, in fact Noella has said she hates Cds… me too. These are the times we live in and we might as well get used to it. I’m all for Noella’s approach. Are ye nervous putting it out by yourself  “I wouldnt want it any other way.Record companies are saturated with artists.Theyre just big banks who make most of the money so I would rather tread slowly and just enjoy the whole process and journey with the folk I trust to help me.” It’s a dferent music world from the s, how’d ye adapt “Its a great time to be a singer-songwriter recording our own songs. The internet has opened up immense possibilities. It’s very hard work. But having the right tools and in the hands of the best people anything is possible!”.Fascinating secret fact revealed…. Jeanette and NoellaHuttonsang in choirs and competed in feiseanna and have been named as an inspiration by most musicians I chat to.Another fascinating fact is that Noella is George Hutton’s big cousin and he has said “Noella and Jeanette are my cousins, but they’ve been a big inspiration of mine growing up. Two fearless performers with two beautul raw and passionate voices, writing songs from their very core, I absolutely love them.”Keep up to date here, www.facebook thefirstnoellaand get the album “Love  Liars” releasedon Saturday from Noella’s band page throughBandcamp.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre. We are looking at the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre location and build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 Down Cathedral.jpg","title":"Down Cathedral receives recognition for tourism  ","story":"DOWN Cathedral in Downpatrick has been officially recognised for giving visitors a warm welcome.The Welcome Ministry of Down Cathedral received special recognition from CIE Tours International at a recent awards ceremony in Dublin.The awards were based on feedback from over , CIE customers surveyed throughout the year.Dean Henry Hull and cathedral administrator Sharon McVeigh collected the award at a ceremony at Dublinrsquos Christ Church Cathedral last month.Down Cathedral was one of only seven locations in Ulster to receive a merit award, along with Hillsborough Castle and the Giantrsquos Causeway.Dean Hull explained that welcome is at the heart of our ministry in Down Cathedral.ldquoOver , people visit the cathedral each year.

He hopes, however, that he has allayed their immediate fears by stressing that he would not tolerate bad behaviour on his premises. He was willing to give a lead to stop it.He made the point to objectors that the ldquosinister element was already in the town and he did not want trouble any more than other shopkeepers or residents who had suffered at the hands of vandals.DOWNPATRICK mdash A young Downpatrick pop group has made a spectacular comeback on the local music trail after a two-year layoff.The former Sunbeams, now calling themselves Memphis, have been travelling up and down the country fulfilling engagements in halls, clubs and hotels.Ironically it was transport problems which forced them off the road in  but they have since been organising their comeback and are now better equipped and more experienced.Their repertoire is packed with the latest sounds and such is their wide selection of numbers that they played non-stop at alast month for five and a half hours.The group is fronted by the delectable and talented Janet Wilcox who is joined by her brother Stewart , Patrick McAuley , Danny Skeffingtonand Philip Hynds .Up to now most of their engagements have ben south of the border but they are now ready to make their mark up north, particularly around Co Down.BALLYKINLAR mdash Portaferry Dramatic Society will present the play lsquoIs the Priest at Homersquo  in the Parochial Hall, Ballykinlar, tomorrow night at pm.Written by the internationally famed Joseph Tomelty, himself a former resident of the town, the play is set in a priestrsquos home in a small in Northern Ireland during the early s.It is currently enjoying a very successful run in parochial and community halls throughout the Ards and Lecale peninsula, and indeed, in response to public demandperformances are being planned at some venues.Two of the playwrightrsquos brothers are members of the society, with Jim Tomelty playing the leading role of the curate.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs. She said this not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town.Cllr Mason said that housing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site.She added: ldquoThe bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road. The new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that Ms Mallon will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.He said: ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch, but the wider South Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 New Queens.jpg","title":"New queens of Ulster  ","story":"ST Maryrsquos High School, Downpatrick, lted the prestigious Erne Cup for the first time at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena, Cookstown, last Wednesday afternoon with a blistering display of attacking football.Victory was no more than the local girls deserved when they gained revenge for last seasonrsquos heartbreaking cup final defeat to the same opposition.St Maryrsquos started the game strongly and turned their possession into scores with an early goal from Saulrsquos Cara Doran settling the nerves.The Enniskillen girls were simply not allowed to play their vaunted expansive game and Katie Convie raced in almost immediately to make it - to - when she capitalised on a poor kick-out.St Fanchearsquos had no intention of giving up their title without a fight and replied with three consecutive points. However, a buoyant St Maryrsquos outfit replied with points from Cora Convery, Alishia Lundy and Shannon Sloan to maintain their six-point lead.Six points quickly became  by the half-time break as St Maryrsquos continued to terrorise St Fanchearsquos and scores from Doran , Abi Murphyand the lethal Shannon Sloangave the locals a commanding - to - lead.St Franchearsquos came out fighting in the second half, scoring a goal and two points without reply to reduce the arrears to  point, but that was as good as it got as St Maryrsquos quickly regained the initiative and went for broke.They certainly put the foot on the gas and points from Erin Sands, Katie Convie and Cara Doran had St Maryrsquos well clear St Fanchearsquos kept on to the bitter end and forced a great save form St Marys goalkeeper Fia McFaul as they tried to get back into contention.However, McFaul and her defensive wall of Keely OrsquoNeill, player of the match Nora Maguire, team captain Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy and Lucy Morgan kept St Fanchearsquos at bay.At midfield, Eimear Teggart and Erin Sands dominated throughout the game and kept their dazzling forward busy with a constant supply of good ball.Abi Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convery, Shannon Sloan and Katie Convie were literally unplayable and gave the St Fanchearsquos defence a torrid time all afternoon.St Maryrsquos: Fia McFaul, Keely OrsquoNeill, Nora Maguire, Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy, Lucy Morgan, Eimear Teggart, Erin Sands, Abie Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convie, Shannon Sloan, Katie Convie.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

Even the unexpected and unlikely can be discussed. It’s called preparation.In September , when unionism was focused on the centenary of the Ulster Covenant, I noted in a column that it also needed to be thinking ahead to the centenary of Northern Ireland in . My argument was that the talents of pro-Union academics, historians, economists, pollsters, PR experts, representatives from party-political unionism and loyalism, along with influencers across the entire pro-Union community , should be harnessed and tasked to prepare for both  and the succeeding decades. Make the case for the Union. Make the case for NI unionism. Establish a coherent, thought-through strategy for expanding the pro-Union vote. So, I was interested in Arlene Foster’s comments in a piece for Saturday’s News Letter: ‘We should not be complacent in defending and promoting the overwhelming benefits of being part of the UK. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the best defence against those who wish to take us out of the UK is to create a socially thriving and economically prosperous Northern Ireland. A Northern Ireland where everyone feels at home and where everyone has a genuine and active stake in determining the future.’Arlene Foster must make sure the Next Generation Unionism project is not solely DUP-led \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...She continued: ‘Last year the DUP began work on developing a Next Generation Unionism approach. This work continues and we must seek to be pro-active in developing our case and building the broadest possible support ... The road will not always be easy. There will be challenges. However this is how we will protect the interests of unionism and secure Northern Ireland’s place for the next  years. We all have a role to play in this process and I look forward to getting started.’I welcome Arlene’s approach, although I would enter one caveat: this must not just be a DUP-led project. The entire pro-Union community must be embraced and involved. Those who support the Union already and many others who could be persuaded to support it in a possible border poll cannot be left to one side during the debate. All voices and shades of opinion need to be heard from the outset and must be represented in whatever form the overarching strategy and policies take.Unionism isn’t built on a single opinion. Once you move beyond a preference for retaining the constitutional status quo you will discover that there are all sorts of nuances and dferences of opinion in play. All of them must be recognised, addressed and then accommodated as far as is possible or practical.There is another issue which must be addressed and it’s one that I have written about fairly recently in this column. There remains a tendency within unionismto blame just about everyone  for whatever present crisis we find ourselves in and, in my letime, I have heard all shades of unionism use ‘crisis’ on a very regular basis. It’s the fault of successive UK governments. It’s the fault of a particular secretary of state. It’s the fault of the media. It’s the fault of the Irish government. It’s the fault of Brussels. It’s the fault of every other party. It’s the fault of ‘peaceniks.’ It’s the fault of the wishy-washy. It’s the fault of the PSNI. And sometimes, when all  fails, it’s the fault of other unionists.So, let me rephrase the questions I asked a few weeks ago. Why does it seem to be in the interests of successive UK governments to undermine unionism why do so many within the UK’s political media establishment seem so willing to listen to the nationalist republican narrative why does the NIO seem to find it easier to side with its Irish counterparts than with NI unionism why do UK prime ministers find it so hard to stand – unambiguously –shoulder to shoulder with unionism and why does unionism find it so dficult to attract key sympathy and support from supposed friends at key moments  Personally, I also think that NI unionism needs to think beyond the economic argumentwhen it comes to making its case. At times we make it sound like the subvention is all that really matters: which probably explains why “You couldn’t afford us,” is one of the most common responses to the prospect of a united Ireland. Sometimes the response is built around the NHS, even though we have , people on waiting lists at the moment and a health service which is massively underfunded. The Union is about more, much more than the economics, and we need to be focusing on the other political cultural social et al benefits.As someone who describes himself – and I’ve done so in front of Irish and Sinn Fein audiences – as an ‘unashamed, unembarrassed and unambiguous’ unionist, I’ve always wanted unionism to be strong enough, eloquent enough and confident enough to make its case. Which is why I want unionism ready and able to make that case from any  and to any audience. Whether a border poll even happens is, to some extent, irrelevant what matters is that unionism always campaigns, articulates, reaches out and promotes its positive message on the premise that the border poll is actually happening next week.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...The shop which was opened in August by Ryan Gilmore, , and his business partner Pete McDonald, , taps into the rich demand for memorabilia amongst the nation’s football mad population.It leans towards the local game, celebrating the old kits and legendary stars of the Irish league, and immortalising national heroes such as Best, Whiteside, Jennings and more latterly Evans, McAuley and Healy. Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Veteransrsquo choirs also provide opportunities in music to a whole new range of people.In another Westminster debate on fire risk in flats and shared housing, I raised the concerns of many constituents relating to building defects, fire safety issues and other matters. I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: \"The Historical Environments Division is a section of the Department for Communities whose responsibility is to protect historical sites in Northern Ireland and therefore safeguard our heritage.In respect to Knock Iveagh on the outskirts of Rathfriland - a prehistoric burial site date back to  years BC and the site where the inauguration of medieval Irish Kings took place - the HED has failed and they have failed miserably. In fact had it not been for the ‘Friends of Knock Iveagh’, a public interest group, this Neolithic site would have destroyed by development that should never have been allowed.\"Having asked written questions of both the Ministers for the Communities and Infrastructure it is clear that their failing from  has led us to a situation where they have now passed the issue onto Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council planners.\"This has put the local government planners in a dficult position. If they were to apply enforcement orders on the developers on Knock Iveagh, the ones that were given permission to develop by the Department for Infrastructure and were not stopped by the Department for the Communities, then there may be a massive compensation or legal cost for such action and that will be passed to the rate payers of the local council area. \"How can it be fair that the rate payers of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon could pick up the cost of the failings by DfC and DfI.\"It is time that both DfI and DfC - who have the powers to put Knock Iveagh back to the way it was before they mistakenly gave authority for a wind turbine development - to step up and take the financial responsibility for their mistakes.

The Department recognises the concerns and strength of feeling but, under the Transition Provisions for the transfer of the majority of planning s to the new Councils in April , responsibility for planning application permission does now lie with the Council. “The planning and enforcement issues in what is a highly complex case are also a matter for the Council. “A spokesperson for ABC Council said: “The Council is currently considering a number of Planning matters in relation to the site at Knockiveagh including requests to revoke discontinue planning permission for the wind turbine.“All of these planning matters remain under consideration at the present time,” said the spokesperson.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2743935.jpg--.jpg?1581604995000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
