Fitch has downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt to its second lowest level, down six notches to C. That’s just one step above borrowers who have defaulted. Fitch said that developments since it last downgraded Russia on March 2nd had further undermined the country’s willingness to service government debt. It points to President Vladimir Putin’s decree last week that Russian creditors can use roubles to pay some foreign currency debts, and the country’s central bank’s restriction of some rouble-denominated debt coupon transfers. The intensifying sanctions could also lead Moscow to default on its obligations, Fitch says: The statement comes after the US and UK said they will ban Russian oil, as the economic response to the invasion of Ukraine continued to ratchet up. Russia is due to make its next debt repayment on March 16 -- though it would have a 30-day grace period to meet the coupon payments. Western sanctions, including a ban on Russia’s central bank from accessing foreign currency reserves, have preventing Putin from accessing much of the $630bn war chest built up in foreign currencies before the invasion. Yesterday, a flurry of major Western countries suspended business in Russia, with Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and McDonald’s joining the pullout following the Ukraine war. Shell announced plans to withdraw from Russian oil and gas and Unilever has said it will stop importing and exporting its products with Russia:  Rating agency Fitch has warned that a Russian sovereign debt default is imminent, as it slashed the country’s credit rating to its second-lowest notch. Fitch predicted that the pain of escalating sanctions raised the proospect of at least a ‘selective non-payment’ of its sovereign debt obligations, after the US and the UK both announced bans on Russian oil imports on Tuesday. With the economy heading into a deep recession, there is clearly much more trouble ahead, with the rouble weakening again this morning. In London, banks, travel companies and Russian miners all had a strong day, recovering some of the major losses in the last two weeks. But analysts have cautioned that the markets may be too optimistic, given the air strike on a Children’s hospital in Mariupol today, and Western fears that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons on Kyiv. The EU has added more names to its sanctions list ,including Russian Formula One driver Nikita Mazepin and Russian business leaders. While the UK government unveiled new aviation sanctions against Russia, toughening up a ban on Russian planes flying or landing in the UK alongside powers to detain any Russian aircraft in the UK. One private jet has already been seized, and could be linked to billionaire Eugene Shvidler, the close friend and business partner of Roman Abramovich. The business backlash against Russia gathered more pace, with the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut has joined the ranks of Western brands suspending its operations in Russia. Kentucky-based Yum! Brands is suspending 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in Russia and finalising an agreement to suspend all 50 Pizza Hut outlets in partnership with its master franchisee. Mothercare, Heineken and Universal Music Group also announced they were halting operations in Russia. Tobacco firm Imperial Brands also announced it will halt operations in Russia, but British American Tobacco will continue selling cigarettes in Russia: While some directors are quitting the boards of Russian firms, others are holding firm: Fertiliser giant Yara has temporarily cut output at two European plants, due to soaring energy prices. With fears of food shortages already rising, Irish dairy and beef farmers are being urged to start growing crops. Agriculture ministers from G7 countries including Britain’s George Eustice will meet on Friday to discuss grain shortages and food price volatility amid the war in Ukraine.  Elsewhere, the US labour market remains tight with 11.3m job vacancies at American companies in January. UK households are the gloomist about financial conditions in a decade, as inflation squeezes incomes. The irony was not lost on some of the Muscovites who were queueing outside a McDonald’s on Tuesday evening, just after the company announced it was temporarily closing its nearly 850 locations in Russia. “My dad once told me how he waited in a long line when McDonald’s opened when he was young. And now I ended up also queueing, but for a very different reason. History can be funny,” said Dmitry Grigoryev. When McDonald’s opened its doors in Moscow’s Pushkin Square in 1990, a queue thousands-long formed. Inside and outside the country, the arrival of the golden arches was seen as a definite sign of the end of cold war. Russians’ embrace of western fast food, pop culture and jeans came to signify the country’s integration into the global capitalist system. Despite rising authoritarianism under Vladimir Putin over the last decade, international brands remained eager to keep their doors open in Moscow and other big cities with a sizable middle class. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the morning of 24 February changed everything. Since then there has been an unparalleled exit of international firms, among them Toyota, Heineken, Nike, Apple, Exxon, Ford, Zara, Netflix and Ikea. “The exodus of companies is really stunning,” said Maria Shagina, an international sanctions specialist at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs and the Geneva International Sanctions Network.  Here’s the full piece: Nikita Mazepin’s contract with the Haas F1 team was terminated after the invasion of Ukraine. Haas F1 was sponsored by the Russian chemical firm Uralchem, whose general director is Mazepin’s father, Dmitry Arkadievich Mazepin. Also on the updated list is Andrey Guryev, a fertiliser Russian billionaire, revealed in 2015 to be the beneficiary of an offshore company that owned Witanhurst, a 25-bedroom property in Highgate,north London. They are among 14 oligarchs and businesspeople on an expanded list of iniduals announced on Wednesday whose assets in the EU will be frozen. EU restrictive measures imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine and before that to the annexation of Crimea in 2014 now apply to more than 30 Russian businesspeople. This compares to the UK’s sanctions list, which has named just 10 oligarchs since 2014. Here’s the full story: But he also cautions that markets may be getting ahead of themselves if they’re optimistic about the Ukraine crisis, especially given a Russian airstrike has reportedly hit a maternity hospital in Mariupol: The London-based cigarette manufacturer, whose brands include Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said it would “continue to operate” in Russia, one of its key growth markets for cigarettes and heated tobacco, according to the company’s latest annual report. It will suspend capital investment and scale back marketing and business activities but stopped short of following its smaller British rival, Imperial Brands, by halting its operations altogether (as covered earlier). That’s a very sharp move, but still leaves oil higher than before the Ukraine invasion (which pushed Brent over $100barrel). Hopes that the Opec group could boost production could be pushing the oil price lower. The mood in the markets has swung around today, and stocks are enjoying a major rally, explains analyst David Madden of Equiti Capital: The blue-chip share index rallied by 226 points to end at 7191 points, a strong rebound that recovers some of its recent losses. Russian households are already beginning to feel the pinch from Western sanctions imposed after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, with economists warning that inflation in the country could reach the highest levels seen in at least two decades.  Official figures published by Moscow this afternoon show the collapse in the rouble led to a sharp rise in weekly consumer price inflation, highlighting the early impact from the US, UK and the EU freezing the central bank of Russia’s assets and hurting its ability to defend the currency. Liam Peach, an emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, explains: Reuters has more details: There were 11.3 million job openings at US firms in January, the latest JOLTS survey showed, ahead of forecast of 10.9m.  It’s a slight drop on December’s upwardly revised 11.45m vacancies, but suggests there were still labor shortages at the start of this year, as the omicron variant hit the economy. LetterOne is one of Pamplona’s limited partners, but Pamplona has decided to redeem those interests after concluding that the links were “increasingly challenging”. It will return the money invested in its funds by LetterOne. LetterOne was founded by Russian billionaire oligarch Mikhail Fridman and partners, with proceeds from the sale of oil group TNK-BP.  Fridman and fellow oligarch Petr Aven, LetterOne’s two biggest shareholders, were sanctioned by the EU, and stepped down from the group last week after their shares were frozen. Pamplona says that once the LetterOne redemption has been carried out, it will have no direct or indirect exposure to any Russian capital. On Monday, three more Russian billionares resigned from LetterOne’s board, with the company also pledging a $150m donation to “support the urgent work under way to help those affected by the war in Ukraine”.

Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Ilkay Gundogan also start.Amorim is without midfielders Matheus Nunes, who is suspended and Palhinha, who is injured, while there are also concerns over the fitness of Moroccan central defender Zouhair Feddal.  Having signed for Sporting from Vitória de Guimarães in January, English winger Marcus Edwards could start on the wing for Sporting this evening, while loanee Pedro Porro could feature at right-back for the visitors against a parent club he has yet to play for. The Spanish 22-year-old has been with City since August 2019 but has spent the intervening two-and-a-half years on loan at Reall Valladolid and now Sporting.  “It was a horrible night,” said Porro of the first leg. “The reality is that it seems like a mission impossible to come back because the result is very convincing, but we are going to Manchester to compete with our heads held high, to try to win the game, even if we can’t qualify.” Ruben Dias, Cole Palmer and Nathan Ake are all sidelined with injury, while Joao Cancelo is ill, leaving City without an experienced right-back. Pep Guardiola said yesterday that John Stones, Fernadinho or some youngster – CJ Egan-Riley, perhaps – could fill in on the right.  Having been on the bench for the Manchester derby which City won so comfortably on Sunday, Londoner Luke Mbete could start – or come on – at centre-back, while Kevin De Bruyn is likely to sit this one out as he is just one booking away from a suspension. His absence could present an opportunity for James McAtee or Liam Delap. Oleksandr Zinchenko, who spoke so eloquently about his worries for his home country Ukraine to Gray Lineker at the weekend, will have to temporarily push his concerns about his family and friends to the back of his mind if, as expected, he starts tonight.

Some 310 schools are to be added to the Deis programme of support for schools with at-risk students. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill Some 310 schools attended by more than 60,000 students are to benefit from additional teaching posts, free schoolbooks and home supports under an expansion of the Deis programme for students at risk of disadvantage.The €32 million expansion of the scheme means one in four students will attend a school where these additional supports are available from next September.Minister for Education Norma Foley said no school will lose out on its existing Deis (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) status, while some will qualify for additional supports.“This is the single biggest investment in educational disadvantage in the history of the State,” she said.“Equality of opportunity in education must be a primary objective. Since becoming minister, I have been very keen to ensure to the absolute maximum that we make available to our students that very opportunity.”Currently 884 primary and secondary schools and over 180,000 students benefit from the Deis programme. This will increase to 1,194 schools and over 240,000 students from September 2022.From September 2022, these schools will be able to access all their additional supports.Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through a refined Deis identification model.The Department of Education says it is a statistics-based model which uses information from enrolment databases and a deprivation index developed by two researchers, the late Trutz Haase and his colleague Jonathan Pratschke. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the Deis programme and the department says the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.A new version of the Deis identification model captures a greater breadth of disadvantage and accounts for severity of disadvantage.It also take into account the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and of students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.Schools in the Deis programme avail of a range of targeted supports aimed at tackling educational disadvantage, including additional classroom teachers , home school community liaison officers, Deis grant funding. access to the school completion supports.The most disadvantaged primary schools - in Deis band one - also benefit from smaller class sizes with 21 students for every teacher, in most cases. The additional investment will provide for in the region of 160 additional primary teachers, 100 additional home school community liaison officers, additional guidance and leadership posts as well as Deis grants and enhanced book grant funding.Responding to the announcement, the Irish National Teacher’s Organisation (INTO) gave the decision a qualified welcome.“It is clear from today’s announcement that 310 primary schools will have more certainty in respect of the future supports they will receive for many of the most vulnerable children in the country. These schools have waited far too long to be included in the scheme,” said INTO general secretary John Boyle. “That said, the fact remains that the vast majority of children in Ireland, including many in our Deis schools, are being taught in class sizes well above the EU and OECD averages. Ms Foley said latest research indicates that the attainment gap between Deis and non-Deis schools has been narrowing.She said many OECD countries such as France were not getting the same outcomes from their investment in tackling educational disadvantage and were studying the Irish scheme.The Department of Education said it will work with the schools that will benefit from the programme to support them to make the transition. Information sessions will be held for schools in the coming weeks on the Deis programme, what supports will be available to schools and to support them in planning for improvement. Materials are in development to inform parents and students of the benefits of inclusion in the Deis programme.

We’re staying in contact with our friends and family online.”Her husband, an IT expert, is staying at home to assist the local authority, while her 60 year old mother opted to stay behind in the family’s apartment due to health concerns.Oresta and her children arrived in Ireland on Friday night after responding to a Facebook post from a Polish mother in Kildare who offered two spare bedrooms in her home.The mother, who asked not to be identified, said she received a response within minutes of posting her message.“I didn’t think it through, really - I just wanted to help, so I found the Ukrainians in Ireland’ Facebook page and left a message.“When Oresta made contact, I showed her pictures of the house, explained that I also had a daughter... I knew she would just want a safe place to protect her children.”When word spread over the weekend in the Ballysax area, close to the Curragh, the local community rallied and organised school uniforms, schoolbags, pencil cases and clothes.St Brigid’s principal Esther Reddy quickly confirmed that the school would be delighted to accommodate the two children.“There was no way we were going to say ‘no’. It seems such a small thing to be able to do,” she says.“Our main concern is that they feel settled and can related to the other children. They’re in wonderful classes with wonderful teachers... We can’t imagine what is going through their heads or how worried they are about their father and grandmother. So, we’re going to do absolutely everything to support them.”Authorities expect anything up to 100,000 Ukrainians may relocate here about a third are likely to be children.Minister for Education Norma Foley said on Wednesday that schools in Ireland will meet the challenge “head-on”.“It is out absolute intention to make provision for children and young people who come into our care,” she said.She said the Ukrainian minister for education informed her that up to 250 schools have been destroyed so far, and more are expected as the war progresses.Ms Foley said officials were identifying schools with additional capacity and will expand English language supports and other services as needed.Oresta Danyliak, meanwhile, still feels dizzy from how her life had been turned upside in the space of a few weeks.“We never imagined this,” she says. “A few months ago we booked a holiday to Legoland in Denmark.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics pearse doherty on sinn f%C3%A9in s policies a united ireland and issues of security and neutrality","story":"Sinn Féin finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty joins Hugh and Pat to discuss what his party\u0027s priorities and policies would be, if they were to lead the next government.

Photograph:   FLORIAN WEISER Getty ImagesAustria has suspended its Covid-19 vaccine mandate, a week before it was due to come into effect, saying it was a “disproportionate” measure given most current cases involve the less-severe Omicron variant.The announcement came as Austria registered nearly 48,000 new cases within 24 hours on Wednesday, a new record and up 55 per cent in a day.From next Tuesday, Austria was set to be the EU’s first member to mandate a Covid-19 vaccination for all over 18, with fines of up to €3,600 and exceptions only for pregnant women and the seriously ill.The mandate was highly controversial and condemned by the far-right opposition Freedom Party (FPÖ) as unconstitutional.On Wednesday morning Vienna said its last-minute U-turn, a month after the mandate was passed by parliament, was based on a government commission report.Austria’s minister for constitutional affairs Karoline Edtstadler said the report had made “many arguments that the encroachment on fundamental rights is not justified”. ‘Proven remedy’The report “expresses very clearly” that vaccination is an effective and “proven remedy” against disease, she said, but that it was necessary to react to events.“Just as the virus is very flexible, we have to be flexible and adaptable,” she said. “I don’t think I need a crystal ball to tell you that today’s isn’t the last chapter we will write regarding the vaccination mandate.”With the suspension to be reviewed in June, Austrian health minister Johannes Rauch urged people to get vaccinated regardless. The 25-page commission report says new variants are “very likely” after the summer meaning further lockdowns cannot be ruled out. The four-member commission says a mandate was “not appropriate” at present and, to maximise protection, made more sense closer to a new wave.“The basic obligation to vaccinate as a tried and tested means of ensuring a high vaccination rate still makes sense in principle in order to avoid overloading the health system,” the authors add. Low vaccination rateOne reason for the mandate was Austria’s relatively low vaccination rate by EU comparison: 70 per cent of the population have received two Covid-19 vaccinations while 57 per cent have a booster jab.The Austrian government hoped that last month’s vote for a vaccine mandate would spark a surge in jabs, but only 26,000 people have come forward in the meantime.The mandate allowed for police to check people’s vaccination status in traffic checks. Those without proof of vaccination would face immediate fines of €600, potentially increasing if they took legal action.Opponents of the vaccine mandate were quick to point out that the measure was postponed but not cancelled. FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl framed the decision as down to the “success of FPÖ policy and pressure from the street”.Neighbouring Germany is also debating a vaccine mandate, with first readings of several proposed Bills tabled for a first reading in the Bundestag in early April. A mandate for particular professional groups, in particular nursing and care staff, will be debated on March 17th.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"climate radicals fuelled europes reliance putins gas now want","story":"We may not be able to enforce a no-fly zone in Ukraine, but at least we are doing something to defeat Putin’s military adventure in the country. Lord Adair Turner wants us to drive at 55 mph on the motorway to save fuel.That’ll teach Vlad the Mad. I can see him quaking even now at the thought of a go-slow past Newport Pagnell Services. There must be grim faces in the situation room at the Kremlin as generals wonder just how much longer they can hold out against British motorists who keep their feet off the throttle.It is true, of course, that Britain and Europe would be in a far better position at the moment were it not for our reliance on Russian gas and oil. Then we really would be able to close down the Russian economy and make life extremely difficult for the Russian war machine. But the reason we can’t do this is because of people like Adair Turner who for years have been trying to run down Britain’s own fossil fuel industry. Turner is chair of something called the Energy Transitions Commission as well as being on the Government’s Climate Change Committee. You get the picture. His call for motorists to drive more slowly – as well as for householders to turn down their thermostats – is inspired less by a desire to defeat Vladimir Putin than by trying to cut carbon emissions.Both may be worthy goals: defeating Putin and cutting emissions. But it is pathetic to conflate the two things and claim that we can tackle the Russian leader’s megalomania through squeezing a few more miles per gallon out of our cars. It is the politics of the primary school: it reminds me of all the bossy posters we used to have up in the classroom when I was six years old imploring us to save water by not running the tap while we brushed our teeth. Isn\u0027t this the worst form of virtue-signalling? A way for pompous liberals to feel good about themselves while actively making the situation worse. It should have been obvious that even if we do succeed in one day eliminating carbon emissions we are going to rely on fossil fuels for many years to come. You can’t run an economy on intermittent renewables alone, not with current technology – we need gas to keep the lights on when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. As for electric cars, remember those rosy predictions just a few months ago of how they were going to reach cost-parity with petrol cars by 2024? There is fat chance of that now with surging prices of nickel and other commodities.Motorists can, of course, save money by driving more slowly. But they can work that out for themselves, thank you they don’t need some quangocrat to tell them what to do. They can also save money by accelerating more slowly and doing fewer short journeys. That is the other foolish thing about Turner’s advice: driving at 55 mph on the motorway isn’t even a particularly effective way of saving fuel. Driven at a steady 70 mph my car will still do 52 mpg. And I can save myself a lot of time, too. And time, when you are trying to run a business which involves moving people and goods about the country, is money.The Denial by Ross Clark is published by Lume Books More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson condemns \u0026#39depraved\u0026#39 strike on maternity hospitalLiz Truss backs return to fracking to stop Russia holding UK to ransom on gasWaitrose stops selling disposable barbecues to protect the planetQueen’s Platinum Champions Awards for volunteers launched by Duchess of CornwallAnger at ‘dinosaur attitude’ of Catholic school towards gay author Britain to send world\u0026#39s most advanced anti-aircraft missile system to UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ditch satnav uber driver takes wrong turn","story":"An Uber people carrier lies abandoned on a rocky hillside - after it got stuck whilst its owner was blindly following his satnav.The driver of the Mercedes Vito minibus taxi got lost trying to get back to the A62 towards Manchester after dropping off a late night fare in Marsden, near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.But the device then urged him to take a short cut across Saddleworth Moor towards the hamlet of Grange in the remote Delph area of Oldham.Despite the narrow uneven path being strewn with rocks and stones the cabbie carried on regardless until the seven seater ground to a halt and was unable to go any further.The driver tried to reverse back but eventually gave up and abandoned the minibus before calling friends to pick him up from the bottom of Hey Flake Lane.Walkers out the following day initially believed the taxi had been stolen and dumped by joyriders until the red faced cab driver returned to the scene and revealed the truth.\u0027He got so stuck he apparently could not get his door open\u0027Craig Hannah, a nearby resident, said: It\u0027s amazing the driver got that far because it was such a rough and very steep track.Apparently he had been working in the area late on Saturday night and was trying to return to base. A passenger did say he could drive down the lane even though there was a sign warning that it was unsuitable for vehicles.If you were local you would know the road is not passable but this guy was clearly out of town and didn\u0027t know.He got wedged about halfway down the lane and he couldn\u0027t reverse so he carried on going. He got so stuck he apparently could not get his door open. It was a nightmare by all accounts.From what we could see the back bumper was off and the only way to retrieve it will be to drag it back up the hill. The driver is a really nice guy who has lost two days of his livelihood. He was shocked.A tow truck was summoned to pick up the minibus whilst a local farmer and his trusted tractor was put on standby to help retrieve the vehicle which will now be taken to a garage for an estimate to repair.In 2008 Oldham Council put up warning sings after scores of motorists became trapped down the same dirt-track on Saddleworth Moor after being guided there by satellite navigation systems. Some drivers were reportedly left in tears after becoming stranded.One local said: We heard the taxi driver was just blindly following his satnav and got stuck. I would have thought the passenger he dropped off would have known the road was impassable. Some people just don\u0027t learn from the old adage - the computer is not always right.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson condemns \u0026#39depraved\u0026#39 strike on maternity hospitalLiz Truss backs return to fracking to stop Russia holding UK to ransom on gasWaitrose stops selling disposable barbecues to protect the planetQueen’s Platinum Champions Awards for volunteers launched by Duchess of CornwallAnger at ‘dinosaur attitude’ of Catholic school towards gay author Britain to send world\u0026#39s most advanced anti-aircraft missile system to UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"heat pump subsidy cash could end pockets would have bought anyway","story":"A £450 million green subsidy scheme to encourage people to get rid of their gas boilers could end up paying people who would have bought heat pumps anyway, the Government’s climate change advisors have warned.The scheme, which launches in April, will offer homeowners grants of up to £5,000 to cover the cost of installing a low-carbon heat pump or biomass boiler.But the three-year scheme is only expected to help fund around 30,000 installations a year, which compares to the 36,000 heat pumps installed without incentives in 2020.In its analysis of the scheme on Wednesday, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) said: “The extent to which these installations will boost sales, rather than fund people who would have bought a heat pump anyway, is unclear.”The Government wants 600,000 heat pumps to be installed a year by 2028, but faces barriers of high upfront cost, a lack of familiarity and low installer numbers.Heat pumps can cost £10,000 to install - although manufacturers say these figures could be cut in half within the next few years - and can require additional insulation work.The concern raised by the CCC came in its assessment of the Government’s heat and buildings strategy, released last year, which outlines plans to decarbonise the country’s homes and office buildings.Some 85 per cent of homes are heated by gas boilers, contributing to around 14 per cent of the UK’s emissions, which the Government has committed to reducing to net zero by 2050.Overall, the CCC said the strategy was “not yet comprehensive or complete”, and failed to account for 18 per cent of the necessary emissions reduction by 2035.It highlighted a lack of funding for energy efficiency funding to help people insulate their homes, particularly for better off households.Cost of fossil fuels increasingThe Government has scrapped funding for energy efficiency measures outside of social housing and public buildings, in the wake of its failed £1.5 billion Green Homes Grant scheme.Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said the importance of decarbonising homes had increased as the cost of fossil fuels had risen.“With the shocking oil and gas price spike this is suddenly one of the most important consumer issues - most homes and offices are currently heated with fossil fuels,” he said.The CCC called on the Government to continue with plans to move environmental and social levies off electricity bills and onto gas bills, despite the cost of gas reaching record highs.“Plans to rebalance levies between gas and electricity will need to reflect the present circumstances, but must make progress to enable the desired shift away from gas in the longer term,” the CCC said.The relatively high cost of electricity has historically meant running a heat pump is more expensive than a gas boiler.The levies, which are expected to be around 8 per cent of a dual fuel bill when the new price cap comes into force in April, would most likely be shifted on to gas bills.Juliet Phillips, senior policy advisor at think tank E3G, said: “A nationwide retrofit drive is needed to lower bills, reduce fuel poverty and boost green jobs – but as the Climate Change Committee’s new report rightly identifies, the Heat \u0026amp Buildings Strategy fell short of providing this impetus.“This is particularly true for owner-occupiers – who represent around two thirds of the housing market and the largest share of emissions, but for whom there remains a shortage of near-term plans for regulations, incentives and subsidies related to energy efficiency.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson condemns \u0026#39depraved\u0026#39 strike on maternity hospitalLiz Truss backs return to fracking to stop Russia holding UK to ransom on gasWaitrose stops selling disposable barbecues to protect the planetQueen’s Platinum Champions Awards for volunteers launched by Duchess of CornwallAnger at ‘dinosaur attitude’ of Catholic school towards gay author Britain to send world\u0026#39s most advanced anti-aircraft missile system to UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"indiana jones deep discovering endurance knocked sideways","story":"When the camera 10,000 feet below the surface of the Wendell Sea zoomed in on the letters that spelt ENDURANCE on the shipwreck, there was, says marine archaeologist Mensun Bound, who led the mission, “a huge ta-dah! moment”. Sir Ernest Shackleton’s polar exploration ship had last been seen 107 years ago when it was slowly crushed and then sunk by pack ice, and until very recently had been thought lost forever.Yet four days on from the discovery, 69-year-old Bound confesses – on an in-and-out phone line from Antarctica – that the enormity of the achievement, the peak of a stellar career of over 40 years that has earned him the nickname ‘the Indiana Jones of the Deep’, has yet to sink in. His head is still spinning.“Shackleton has been a lifelong thing for me,” he explains. He grew up in the nearby Falkland Islands – and still has a home there – where the polar explorer’s “greatest escape of all time” in leading his crew of 27 to safety after the loss of their ship has made him the enduring local hero. “I have with me right now a book on Shackleton that I was given for regular Sunday school attendance in the 1960s,” he says. Indeed some reports have even suggested that Bound is related to Shackleton, who at the time of the sinking had been attempting to make the first crossing of Antarctica. “At that point,” says Bound calmly, “we knew it must be Endurance because it is the only shipwreck that is down there.”   It was only when they switched to cameras, however, that what was revealed “sent shivers up my spine,” he says. Even more extraordinary in a life-changing moment of superlatives was the state of preservation of Shackleton’s ship. “Without any exaggeration this is the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever seen – by far – sitting upright, bold and beautiful and largely intact.” The combination of the extreme icy cold at that depth – “water is a brilliant preservative” – and the absence in the Weddell Sea of wood-eating marine organisms that feast on timber wrecks elsewhere has produced what Bound refers to simply as “magic”.   “You can see a porthole that is Shackleton’s cabin. At that moment, you really do feel the breath of the great man upon the back of your neck. You can even see the paintwork. It is in such a good state that I felt in that moment we could almost raise her and sail off.” Almost. The Antarctic Treaty contains strict rules on disturbing wrecks but, even if it was allowed to bring Endurance to the surface, the technology needed is not yet available. “Not in my lifetime,” Bound says. “Conservation science hasn’t reached that stage, but in 40 or 50 years…” So speaks a man whose life has been defined by a fascination with the oceans. “I was always enthralled by the sea growing up. I was going out on a schooner when I was still a boy.” He was christened Michael, but has always been known as Mensun, his childhood mispronunciation of the word “medicine”, after a bout of severe illness. At 11, he was sent to secondary school in Uruguay.After a spell on a merchant ship in his late teens, he studied history and then archaeology at university first in the US and then at Oxford, where he still lives with his wife Joanna and three grown-up children. In the early 1980s he made his name excavating an Etruscan shipwreck from the sixth century BC off the Italian island of Giglio, and went on to head the first academic marine archaeology unit in England at Oxford. But part of him has always belonged in the South Atlantic.  In the next day or two, the expedition’s icebreaker, SS Agulhas II, will stop off en route for South Africa on the uninhabited South Georgia, a Falkland Islands dependency until 1985. This was where Shackleton led his men to safety after an 800-mile open-boat journey. And it is where the man they called “the Boss” was buried in Grytviken Cemetery in a funeral that took place exactly 100 years to the day before Endurance was rediscovered.  Some argue that wrecks should be left where they are, especially if they are the last resting place of those who died in them, though that wasn’t the case with Endurance. Bound believes that one day it should be brought to the surface. “Even though it is so well-preserved, the longer we leave it there as pollution increases and sea temperature and acidity rise, the more it will rot and what we have found will be gone, lost to learning and to heritage,” he says. For Bound, she is more than a ship. There is the whole escape saga of Shackleton and his crew.  “He wasn’t the two-dimensional Edwardian hard man that he is sometimes portrayed as. With all his bravery, determination, leadership skills as well as his imperfections, Shackleton should be as important in our national bloodstream as the likes of Nelson and Churchill.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson condemns \u0026#39depraved\u0026#39 strike on maternity hospitalLiz Truss backs return to fracking to stop Russia holding UK to ransom on gasWaitrose stops selling disposable barbecues to protect the planetQueen’s Platinum Champions Awards for volunteers launched by Duchess of CornwallAnger at ‘dinosaur attitude’ of Catholic school towards gay author Britain to send world\u0026#39s most advanced anti-aircraft missile system to UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"verschlimmbesserung new german word need life","story":"Of all the German terms for which we don’t have equivalents in English, Verschlimbesserrung, the act of making something worse by trying to make it better, may be the most poetic. (Although kustomerseparationprism, their term for the little triangular ider at supermarket checkouts, comes a close second.) Examples of Verschlimbesserung are all around us. Sitcoms depend on them: think of Father Ted trying to even out a dent in his car and trashing the whole thing. Sport is full of it, too. The Hundred seems to have hastened the demise of the England cricket team Cristiano Ronaldo’s return has heralded the destruction of Manchester United. You could make a persuasive argument that most politics is a study in Verschlimbesserung. It’s not a perfect translation, but we do have a version of this thought in English: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Here are five common causes of Verschlimbesserung in day to day life. HonestyAt certain junctures we all feel compelled to speak the truth. A friend has put on weight, or is drinking too much, or sleeping with someone to whom they are not married. At such fraught moments, the urge to confess, or reveal a secret, can be irresistible. Just a little dollop of truth, you think, and the situation will be resolved. It never happens like that. Jack Nicholson was right, we can\u0027t handle the truth. One man’s clear-the-air revelation is another’s unwelcome meddling. They will probably know they have put on weight, or that they are drinking too much. They might even already suspect their partner is cheating. (In France they will presume it.) Nobody ever thanks you for airing their dirty laundry. Especially not if they say “thank you for telling me”. Small amounts of DIY I’m not talking about the big ticket grands projets here. If you’re attempting your own loft conversion or digging a car park into your basement you probably know what you are doing, or ought to. I mean the minor tasks, so meagre you think getting a professional in would be demeaning to both of you. What kind of a man or woman, you think to yourself, gets another man or woman to come in to touch up a minor bit of paintwork or drill a few holes? This is a grave error. If the 2012 case of the ‘Monkey Christ’ taught us anything, the act of trying to improve a painting can easily ruin it. A devout octogenarian decided to “fix” a fresco in the church of the small Spanish town where she lived, turning a respectable Jesus into a blurry potato. The same is true of DIY. By the time you capitulate and summon a professional, the problem will be twice as bad and the humiliation twice as acute.DietingThe road to a Verschlimbesserung is paved with good intentions. There are few forms of self-improvement purer than dieting. You wake up one morning, not necessarily on January 1 or Ash Wednesday, resolved to cut out the carbohydrates and ditch the booze. Everything goes swimmingly for the first day. Maybe two days. But before you know it the starvation kicks in and you relapse at the biscuit tin. Your panicked monkey-brain demands more calories than before. By the end of the week you are fatter than when you began, not to say depressed and bristling with self-recrimination. Cutting your own hairGlancing in the mirror before a date or important meeting you are struck by a strange and shaggy-looking Yeti figure. Not the kind of person to give any kind of job to. Just a bit off here, you think, and you’ll emerge into Don Draper. Just lop that little fringe in, attend to the emergent rat-tail at the back, buzz that back of the neck fuzz with the clippers. It’s uneven, so you have to do a bit more. In this way your personal appearance dies by a thousand cuts. It’s how the mullet was invented. If you look like David Beckham or Kristen Stewart your rogue lid will become a trend. If you look like the rest of us, your colleagues will present you with Toni \u0026amp Guy vouchers. See also: plastic surgery. RebrandingOnce in a while every company feels the urge to rebrand, to tweak something to improve its product. Sometimes they are distancing themselves from an increasingly toxic reputation. BP, for example, hoped that by switching to a simple acronym people would forget its distant previous association with fossil fuels. Sometimes it is a disaster. WeightWatchers became WW and its earnings collapsed. Coke discovered that people were not ready for New Coke. You can’t fool consumers. The same applies for personal rebrands, as attempted by undergraduates as long as universities have existed. It never works. We can’t run from our true selves, especially not since social media arrived to provide a handy archive of your dreadful looks. In some cases, whole countries attempt to rebrand. The Czech Republic became Czechia, not that your dad noticed. It remains to be seen whether Brexit will be the ultimate Verschlimbesserrung, or simply an act of improvement. Either way, you can bet the Germans will have a view.What moments of Verschlimmbesserung have you encountered?

It will also bring in a long-awaited ‘register of beneficial ownership’ to better show the chains of who really owns vast assets through shadowy firms.Home Secretary Priti Patel insisted the Bill would set a new global standard for transparency.But critics warn loopholes will give Vladimir Putinaposs cronies a head start and “get-out-of-London-free” card - with time to hide their dirty money”.  Cross-party rebels were racing tonight to toughen up the Economic Crime Bill in the Lords with a flurry of amendments tomorrow. One furious MP told the Mirror: “There’s the danger that by rushing it through, you botch something that would have been a good tool.” Another pointed out it doesn’t actually do much on sanctions, it’s all about transparency - and MPs are trying to “dress it up as something it’s not”. So what are the six biggest hitches in the law  We go through them here.  Six-month grace period for declaring assets The Bill will introduce a “public register of beneficial owners of overseas entities owning land in the UK, which will be held by Companies House”. This is after years of complaints that dirty money is plunged into London property through shadowy offshore property. There are still several concerns about this - more on this below. But a principle one was the time period for declaring your assets. It was going to be  months and Tory ministers cut it to six months.But the government refused to accept Labour ’s plans for a -day grace period to declare assets in the UK.Labour’s Seema Malhotra warned: “Six months still provides ample time for criminals to sell properties and find other assets in which to invest.” Ministers did promise to name oligarchs who sell up during the transition. Business minister Paul Scully: “They will have to register ownership, so we will get their ownership details either when they sell or at the end of the transition period.”  Could assets still just be declared via an offshore company Tory MP Anthony Mangnall questioned whether the register of beneficial ownership, as drawn up, will let oligarchs “get away with it”. He wanted ministers to address the issue of nominees - lawyers often in a Panama or Virgin Islands company who are supposedly the owner. He said: “Do the enforcement mechanism and the reference to named iniduals enable us to stop them doing that ”Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith replied: “They should, because the inidual has to declare the whole chain. “Not knowing” would be no excuse.”Former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick added: “If I wanted to conceal the ownership of a property, I would simply set up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands… We must resolve that.” Assets won’t be seized immediately Boris Johnson told his MPs to reject plans to immediately freeze assets, such as land, flats, mansions, yachts and aircraft, when an oligarch’s name is announced - and before they are actually sanctioned.Cross-party MPs led by Tory David Davis put forward the amendment but it was defeated -. It would have immediately banned anyone formally named by the UK government from selling any assets or moving them out of the UK. It would have covered land, houses, businesses, art, jeweller, yachts, jets, gold and bank deposits. Mr Davis said: “What will we see during the months it takes to get people to the legal point at which they are sanctioned  “We will see Russians scrambling to sell off their houses, dispose of their businesses and offload their football clubs.”  People who help the ‘economic wellbeing of the UK’ could be exempt Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said she was concerned one exemption could “drive a coach and horses” through the crackdown. She pointed out there is an exemption to declaring ownership of propertya Tory minister decides it is “in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the UK.” There is also an exemptionit is “in the interests of national security” or “for the purposes or preventing or detecting serious crime.” But an amendment to overturn this was not selected so could not be voted on in the Commons. They could transfer to a minority stake or a family member UK officials admit they are limited in what they can freeze or seize when sanctioning oligarchs. This is because under current sanctions law, ownership counts as owning more than half of something, and family members are not subject to sanctions. While the Bill is mainly about transparency rather than actual sanctions, it will be slightly better on this front. When deciding how property should be declared, “beneficial ownership” will be defined as owning % or more of an asset.But SNP MP Alison Thewliss had urged ministers to lower the threshold for beneficial ownership from % to %.She said: “Evidence already points to the threshold being gamed and to people appointing family members and those they can easily control, and the Government need to be aware of that and do more to prevent it.”  Shutting off Russian banks’ access to the West, with plan to move to full asset freeze on all Russian banks.  Sanctions on Russian central bank and financial institutions, already in effect.  Preventing Russian firms and the Russian state raising debt in the UK, already enacted.  Asset freeze against inidual oligarchs, with  so far including Putin and Lavrov and more to come.  Targeting key strategic sectors including defence with more planned on services and energy.  Blocking access to SWIFT, with UK still pushing for a full SWIFT ban against all Russian banks.  Banning Russian planes and ships landing in UK, with new laws next week to put this on longer-term footing.  Banning export to Russia of ‘dual-use’ items such as electronics that could be used in military computers or weaponry.  Setting a £, limit on wealthy Russians’ deposits in UK bank accounts.  Extending the above sanctions to Belarus due to its role supporting the Russian invasion.  Extending UK-Crimea total trade embargo to the Luhansk and Donetsk ‘People’s Republics’. But still no date, due to concerns about protecting Ukrainians still there.  Sanctions on all members of Russian Parliament and Russian National Security who voted in support of invasion. Still in progress despite EU acting already. For more information click here. Enforcement Critics say the law will be useless without proper enforcement, and it doesn’t currently exist. Government-ally MPs also voted down bids to be more transparent about the funding of enforcement, and to bring a new law reforming Companies House. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, former chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said agencies charged with punishing breaches are “no longer fit for purpose” after a decade of austerity. She said: “Money laundering prosecutions have dropped by % over the past five years, just as money laundering has increased and intensied in the UK economy. Fraud is now the most common crime committed in the UK, with more than  million offences, but hardly any are prosecuted.” Ms Hodge told the Mirror: “This is not an Economic Crime Bill. It’s simply a transparency issue around properties.

Days after the party fundraiser, on July , , the passenger jet Malaysia Airlines flight  was shot down by a surface to air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine.And just months earlier, Putin had faced international condemnation over the annexation of Crimea.But speaking to LBC Radio’s Andrew Marr today, the former PM insisted Mrs Chernukhin had attempted “absolutely no influence” on UK policies on Russia.Askedhe remembered the game, he said: “I do, I remember - and there was absolutely no conversation about Russia, finance, Putin or anything .”  “We had a very careful system for vetting who could and could not give money to the Conservative Party. “A small handful of people had any connections with Russia, and as I’m concerned most of them were dissidents, often Ukrainians.” Mrs Chernukhin was born in Russia, studied in the United States and became a British citizen in . She is legally eligible to vote and make donations to UK political parties, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on her part.Ms Chernukhin has repeatedly paid for access to successive Prime Ministers ministers in Party fundraising auctions, including a ‘girl’s night out’ with Theresa May and Liz Truss, dinner with then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and a second tennis match with Boris Johnson, after he became Prime Minister.In total Ms Chernukhin has given almost £ million to the Conservatives - and is the biggest female political donor in British history.Mr Cameron went on: “But crucially, this point - Britain had the strongest anti-Putin policy of any country in Europe. “Who threw him out of the G  Who insisted on the sanctions  Who passed the rules on beneficial ownership  “So I think it’s a giant red herring to suggest in some way that Russian money somehow influenced policy against Putin and Russia.” He added he was the “strongest ally in building a really robust case in holding Putin to account.”  Asked what Mrs Chernukhin and other Russian expat donors were paying for when they gave money to the party, he replied: “Like many people who come and live in this country and make it their home, they get involved in politics because they care about this country, and making sure it’s an open, tolerant and democratic country.” He said there was “absolutely no influence” on the UK’s Russia policies adding: “If they were trying to buy something, they didn’t really get it, did they ” On Tuesday evening, Mrs Chernukhin was given the Award of St Agnes, one of most prestigious honours handed out by the Republic of San Marino at a ceremony in London. The event was attended by a high-level government delegation from the micro-country, including Captains Regent Francesco Mussoni and Giacomo Simoncini, the dual heads of state. Tory MP Andrew Rossindell, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on San Marino, attended the event and gave a speech. And on Wednesday morning, the delegation met with Boris Johnson, which they described as “friendly”. Earlier Mr Cameron called Russian president Vladimir Putin a phenomenal liar. The Conservative told LBCaposs Tonight With Andrew Marr that when hosting the Russian president in No  in  Mr Putin let his guard down and said, aposFundamentally Iaposm not a democrat and I donapost share your interestsapos. Mr Cameron added: He was also a phenomenal liar. I remember confronting him with evidence that Russian troops were in the Donbas, he flat out lied, I remember confronting him with evidence about the shooting down of a Malaysia Airline - there was no naivety.

More than two million people have left their homeland.But just  British visas so far have been granted to people fleeing Vladimir Putin ’s forces.Bungling Home Office ministers were tonight scrambling to quell mounting criticism.Beleaguered Immigration Minister Kevin Foster - who appeared in the Commons instead of Ms Patel - was slammed by all sides as he claimed checks were needed to thwart Russian spies pretending to be Ukrainian asylum seekers from slipping into Britain and carrying out nerve agent attacks.  No announced a special Minister for Refugees as Downing Street tried to catch up with the public mood.But veteran Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale suggested Home Secretary Priti Patel should quit.Quoting Ms Patel’s words from  hours earlier, he told the Commons: “The Home Secretary said, ‘I have already made it clear in terms of the visa application centre that has now been set up en route to Calais, that we have staff in Calais’. “That was untrue, and under any normal administration, that in itself would be a resignation issue.” Conservative Tracey Crouch said some refugees could wait seven weeks for an appointment at a Polish centre. She said: “We have been advised to get people to Rzeszów in Poland for biometric testing to support their application, but the word on the ground is that there are no biometric appointments in Rzeszów until the end of next month.” Former Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: “Snails also move ‘at pace’.”  A long line of MPs slammed the Home Office for the fact a sponsorship route for Ukrainians with no family links to the UK is still not set up. It will allow Brits, firms and charities to bring refugees to the UK for an “initial”  monthsthey provide accommodation. There are hopes warm-hearted Brits could give up their spare rooms - but there is still no date for the scheme to launch. Tory MP Steve Brine added: “So much about this doesn’t feel right and my constituents know what they see. “All of this is far too robotic, and there’s very little Christian compassion being shown at the moment. “Surely we are past the UK saying we’re going to have a generous scheme - it’s time to deliver a generous scheme.” Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke said: “I’m proud of my constituents who are coming forward to offer as much help as possible. I’m proud of the Prime Minister in the way he is leading the world.  But the Home Office is cutting off their legs. And it is simply not good enough. Does the Home Office recognise that this is a war of the likes that’s not been seen for  years ” He added: “This is a disgrace… Get a grip!” Tory MP Julian Sturdy said: “Now is not the time for box-ticking and red tape. Now is the time to do everything we can.No more excuses. Weeks is simply not good enough! These are women and children! We have to speed it up!” Ministry of Defence officials will help process visa applications, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace revealed. But the defiant Home Office tonight continued to resist pleas for a visa application centre at Calais - the port in northern France closest to Britain where Ukrainian refugees have mustered in the hope of joining relatives already in the UK. Instead, the ministry is opening a “pop-up” centre in Lille, with Eurostar laying on free trains to help exhausted and frightened families travel from Calais to Lille for processing. Amid rising anger that refugees gathering in Calais were being sent to Brussels and Paris for checks, the Home Office initially refused to say where a promised centre “en route to Calais” would be set up.But Foreign Secretary Liz Truss let slip to the Commons that it was Lille.Immigration Minister Mr Foster then faced furious MPs demanding to know why the processing of applications was taking so long.Shadow Home secretary Yvette Cooper said: Two million refugees have left Ukraine. Other countries are supporting hundreds and thousands of people.“The Home Office is currently issuing just around  family scheme visas a day. Most want to stay close to home but some want to come here to join family or friends, and we should be helping them. “Instead most people are still being held up by our Home Office bureaucracy or being turned away. Mr Foster claimed security checks were needed on refugees to make sure they were not Kremlin agents who could unleash a nerve agent attack in Britain - like the  novichok atrocity in Salisbury. The Government will not take chances with the security of this country and our people, Mr Foster told MPs. He added: “Sadly, we are already seeing people presenting at Calais with  documents claiming to be Ukrainian. “With incidents like Salisbury still in our minds, the Government will not take chances with the security of this country and our people.” Furious MPs lined up to condemn the Home Office approach. SNP MP Stuart C McDonald fumed: Don’t quote Salisbury at us, that has absolutely nothing to do with this.Tory MP Andrew Murrison added: “Salisbury borders my constituency. I fully accept the need for security checks, particularly on adult males. But the fact remains that Ireland, with which we share a common travel area, has a population of million but has committed to , refugees from Ukraine and has admitted already over ,. This country, population million, has come nowhere even close to that. Why not ” Lib Dem Tim Farron said Mr Foster had “misread the country”, with British families “desperate” to help Ukrainians. The party’s home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: This is yet more chaos and incompetence from the dysal Home Office.” Defending the Government’s handling of the crisis, Mr Foster said it had “brought forward a generous humanitarian offer to those Ukrainians who want to come to the UK to escape the conflict”. He added: “Last week, the Home Secretary announced a new Ukraine family scheme for those with family ties to the UK, and we are extending the scheme further to include aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins and in-laws. “The scheme went live last Friday and has already seen over , applications submitted, for which over  visas have been issued, with more being issued as we speak. “We have also announced that we are setting up a new humanitarian sponsorship visa, and we are working at pace with our colleagues in the Department for Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities to set that up.” Foreign Secretary Ms Truss also faced MPs’ rage when she answered questions in the Commons.Shadow Foreign Office Minister Catherine West blasted a “paltry effort to offer refuge” and accused the Government of a shameful lack of humanity, saying the shambles was a stain on its efforts to tackle the Ukraine crisis. Former Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said sending Ukrainian refugees who want to come to Britain to Brussels and Paris to apply for visas brings the UK into disrepute.SNP frontbencher Chris Law blasted the Home Officeaposs “continued xenophobic and inhumane immigration policy”, claiming it was “a complete humiliation” for the Government.

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

Lucy Challenger, , was brought up by parents and grandparents who taught her how to behave in formal situations, like sitting down to fancy dinners. “They taught me manners and behaviour within the family and also outside the home,” Lucy told The Mirror. “It was important to them and as I grew older I realised why it was important. “I was lucky enough to travel and I witnessed dferent cultures, dferent manners and etiquette changes. I found the whole thing fascinating.” For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here As she made her way around the world, she learned some things that are considered polite in the UK would be insulting in other cultures and vice versa. She said: “In western etiquette you’re not meant to slurp your soup. But in Asian cultures slurping is more common and it’s considered a compliment to the chef. “One or the other could cause offence in dferent parts of the world.” Similarly, she says there are some cultures in which elbows on the table is the done thing, whereas in many other cultures it’s considered rude.  Lucy, who is the CEO and founder of her company Polo and Tweed, kept up her appreciation of good etiquette as she got older, and now teaches the same values to her own child. More recently, she decided to share her expertise on a TikTok account to seeshe could influence anyone . In her videos, Lucy shared advice on how to behave in certain situations like dining at silver service restaurants, helping people understand which cutlery to use for which course, and how to sit at the table. She also instructed people how to dress at job interviews - and perhaps her most popular videos are teaching how to walk in heels. When her first walking in heels video shot up to one million views, Lucy was astounded. “I was really surprised. I think we all have our own worlds and existences and it’s hard to imagine outside of that. “I’m lucky I get to experience formal dinners - I have clients all over the world and deal with a luxury, high-end market. “For some people who haven’t travelled or had manners or etiquette taught to them, it’s not on their radar.” Although Lucy recognises she’s privileged to have been able to travel, she says it’s humbling to know people who may not have had the same opportunities as her are interested in her content. And while it’s mainly young people who have picked up her videos, people of all ages send her messages of support. “Some people will say, ‘I’m a  year old woman and I was taught this by my grandma’ and thank me for bringing back that family memory,” she said. Lucy’s channel has become so popular that many of the videos she now makes are in response to questions from people commenting on them. “Half the channel is now responding to questions and requests, which takes time to do as I do have a job - I’m not a full time influencer,” she said. Among the requests she’s had are how to eat certain foods like king prawns and grapes - which she needs to sit down and prepare before she can film the videos. While most of the engagement she receives is positive, Lucy has had some unpleasant comments from people who don’t like her content. “I don’t allow violent or abusive language on my videos, but I’m pretty resilient. People have their own opinions and I respect that,” she said. Lucy added: “If I can help a few more people feel confident going for a nice meal or to an interview, then I’ll be happy.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FoodTikTok\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They were three of a six-strong gang, armed with flick knives, who interrogated two men inside the property to find out information about their drug dealer, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard. The men then went to another address again looking to rob narcotics and money. There they threatened a woman with a crowbar - making her so terried that she wet herself, StokeonTrentLive reports. But the gang fled empty-handed after being frightened off by a heroic grandma who confronted them and threatened to call . Now Girgish has been jailed for four years,, while Olah and Myettis have been locked up for three and a half years.Prosecutor Peter McCartney told the court a six-strong gang went to a house in London Road, Newcastle-under-Lyme, at pm on June  last year as they were aware a previous occupant had been recalled to prison. They found two men inside after entering unannounced. They threatened to stab and slash the two men as they demanded to know where the drugs were. The prosecutor said: The defendants then noticed the remnants of some cannabis the two men had been smoking and demanded to know where it had come from. The two men were separated. One was left in the sitting room with two men sat either side of him on the sofa. One showed him a kne and said, aposTell me where they are. Tell me now. Where are the drugs apos. The other man was dragged by his arm into the dining room. The description fits Myettis. The man was made to sit in a chair. Girgish sat next to him. He was interrogated. They wanted to know who he had bought his cannabis from. He was reluctant to disclose but they became more threatening. Flick knives were produced by two of the men and brandished threateningly. The man gave him the information and they began to discuss what to do, including where they thought the dealer kept his money. The court heard the gang took the man out of the address to the dealeraposs house nearby. The man tried to run off but was caught. Mr McCartney said: He was toldhe did anything like that again he was going to be stabbed. They took him back to his house. The man managed to communicate with his friend that he needed to get out the house and he ran out the back door, climbed the fence and got away. The victim was walked by the group back to the dealeraposs driveway. They all started to go down it and the victim managed to run away. Mr McCartney added: The dealer was not at home. A woman was in a garage. The gang asked where the weed was. When it became clear she did not know, they asked where the money was. She screamed. One of the defendants took out a crowbar and told her to stop screaming. She was so scared she wet herself at the scene.  The manaposs grandmother came out of the house and confronted the defendants. She threatened to call the police and they left. The defendants were identied by the police from CCTV and were arrested. Girgish, of Century Street, Hanley, Olah, of Dundee Road, Etruria, and Myettis, of Cauldon Road, Shelton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob. Barry White, mitigating for Myettis, said his client is remorseful. He said: He is very cross with himself for becoming involved. He said Myettis is subject to immigration bail pending deportation. He added that no injury was caused and the kne was not used to inflict any injury. David Farley, representing Olah, said the defendant has been in custody for eight months and has spent  hours a day in his cell. He said: He regrets committing the offence. He has let his family and himself down. Stuart Muldoon, mitigating for Girgish, said: He fears he is at risk of deportation at some point once he is released from his sentence. Judge Paul Glenn added: This was a joint enterprise involving the production of weapons including flick knives and a crowbar in order to interrogate and intimidate other people. The object of the exercise was to obtain drugs and money. As many as six of you were involved at dferent stages. This was very much a group and gang activity. Your actions caused signicant distress to one woman. It has had a psychological effect on her and impacted on her physical health. And there is no doubt she was not the only person affected. You produced weapons at ious stages of the incident to threaten violence. The obvious inference is that you had them available for use should you meet any resilience. Fortunately it did not get to that stage and no-one ultimately was injured. The sentences should trigger automatic deportation, certainly in respect of some of you.

The building is expected to be one of the most modern properties the city has ever seen, described by their planning agents as a signicant statement. Blueprints for the home reveal the use of glittering zinc, bricks and glass which usually appears on Channel aposs Grand Designs show hosted by Kevin McCloud. One property developer who has built homes for millionaires said: “It is quite a spectacular home but the first thing that strikes you about it is the sheer scale of the place. “Edinburgh’s planners are a conservative bunch, so a plan which seems to gobble up its garden may struggle to win planning permission.  “There also appears to be a fairly dramatic driveway which curves up to the property, something you would expect to see in the Hollywood Hills. This has the potential to be a £ million house.” The current footprint of the bungalow is around  sq ft with the mansion seeing an increase of around , sq ft. The main living accommodation sits on the upper floor, with a dining and kitchen area connected by stairs to a large living space, with windows on each side. All the bedrooms appear to come with glass-fronted balconies as well. City of Edinburgh Council confirmed it received an official planning application last month. The couple were not available for comment when approached by EdinburghLive. Lisaaposs parents won £ million in what was the UKaposs biggest ever Lotto win in . Mr and Mrs Martin both sat in silence for five minutes shaking their heads when they learned they had become instant millionaires. Speaking at the time, the couple said they hoped to buy a ticket to outer space with Mr Martin having his heart set on a £, ticket onboard Richard Bransonaposs Virgin Galactic. Mrs Martin said: “What have we done ” before the couple drank endless cups of Tetley tea to let the news sink in.

Alex Holland’s body was tragically found face down in water by a dog walker on February . His mum Rachel last saw him on the night of November  when he stepped outside their front door to have a cigarette.And she claims US psychic Mary Lawton Johnson contacted both her and Kent Police to tell them where they would find missing Alex, .The renowned medium also says she is convinced Alex was murdered - and that police should do more to investigate. Mary, who lives in Florida and has never been to the Hollands’ hometown in Kent, saw visions of Alex face down in a pool of water. She says she sent  emails to the police and Alex’s family with maps highlighting areas of water which should be searched. Despite pressure from both women, police did not search those areas. Guidelines published by the College of Policing in  advise that information from psychics should not be dismissed. According to mum Rachel, Alex was found in one of Mary’s highlighted areas wearing one shoe and his death still remains a mystery. The other open-toed and backless shoe was recovered ft from where his hire car was found.His phone was still in the car, but no suicide note had been left. Despite putting pressure on the police to find them, Rachel says she still doesnapost know where his wallet or car keys are. Alex’s body was found approximately . miles away from their family home in Deal, Kent. Rachel, , suspects that her son was murdered and his body disposed of in the water - a suspicion Mary supports. The psychic believes three people were involved in Alex’s death. A post mortem examination has recorded the cause of death as aposunexplainedapos. Rachel said: “I believe my son was murdered. “Right now, I can’t prove that but I do because too many things don’t add up. “I just want the truth. “Last time I saw him, he popped his head round my bedroom door and told me and his dad he was going to have a cigarette, shower and then go to bed. “He asked his dad to wake him up in the morning for work. “But I got up an hour later to go to the toilet and realised he wasn’t in, so I thought he must have just gone out. “I was phoning his mobile the next day, and come tea time I was worried. “I thought ‘I need to know where he is’ and called the police to report him missing.” Alex was living back home with his parents after separating from his we before he went missing. Police and search parties went looking for him  hours after he was last seen. His body wasn’t found for another  days.  Rachel is certain her son didn’t commit suicide. She added: “I know what it’s like to hit a point so low that you’re at that stage - but my son wasn’t like that. “And he would have never left his two girls - he loved them. “He was such a loving dad. “He was a loving son too, he was a good son. “He’d phone us every day to check in on us.” Psychic Mary made contact with Alex’s family in the weeks after he went missing. She told Rachel that she had driven past a very angry man on the side of the road near her home in Florida. She quickly realised that man was a vision of Alex. Mary was quite scared by how angry Alex was and told his family it was because he had been jumped and killed the night he went missing. Rachel added: “I’ve said that to the police since day one. “I believe he was dragged out of his car and taken in another vehicle and killed. “Police wouldn’t believe me - they wouldn’t listen to a single word I said.”Alex’s family raised awareness of his disappearance with emotional appeals and a dedicated Facebook page.After months of no leads, his body was recovered from water in Hacklinge, Kent. Officials have stipulated to his family that he is likely to have been there the whole time - meaning Mary’s predictions were right all along. Mary says she has sent descriptions of three suspects to officers but police continue to treat Alex’s death as non-suspicious. Toxicology reports are not expected for at least another  weeks. Kent Police said officers have made extensive enquiries following the death of Alex Holland from Deal who had been reported missing on Sunday  November  and whose body was discovered on Thursday  February  near Hacklinge in Kent. A report is being prepared for the coroner who will hold an inquest to determine the cause of death. Detective Inspector Louise Murphy of Kent Police said: A number of enquiries have been carried out into the circumstances of the death, including reviewing CCTV footage and examining mobile phone data and, based on the available information, there is nothing so far to suggest the death is suspicious. A post-mortem has been completed and we are treating the death as unexplained at this stage, pending further toxicology results. All of the evidence gathered will be submitted to the coroner for consideration. Updates have been provided to the family of the deceased where appropriate and we will continue to relay any concerns or questions they may have to the coroner. We appreciate how dficult this is for Alex’s family and friends and our thoughts remain with them.

Sadly, this led to taunts from school bullies and stares from strangers on the street.However, despite cruel comments, determined Niamh, of Glyncorrwg, South Wales, refuses to feel downhearted, choosing instead to embrace looking dferent. Her mum, Amy, couldnapost be prouder with how Niamh has dealt with nasty remarks from bullies, or comments from those who stop her in the street, describing her as confident in her own skin and an inspiration to us all. Brave Niamh has now decided to stop wearing her wig out and about and has also chosen to sign up to a number of modelling agencies, all while supporting other women and girls with the condition. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Alopecia, which can be a temporary or permanent condition, happens when an overactive immune system attacks a personaposs hair follicles due to genetic factors, hormonal changes, or medical conditions.Itaposs unclear whether or not Niamhaposs hair will ever grow back. She began losing patches of hair when she was three, despite having been born with a full head of hair and having had long hair as a toddler, and experiencing more rapid hair loss when she turned five. Amy, , said: It started as three patches, Niamh didnapost notice and it grew back. We tried dferent styles to cover the patches, but the hair was becoming very fine and tangly. When Niamh turned five in December, it became more noticeable and by the summer holidays it was all gone. Niamh said to me,my body needs hair it will grow it. aposMum, letaposs just go with the flowapos, so now we only speak positively about hair loss. The terms apossuffering withapos or a apossurvivor ofapos are not words we use. However, the mum-of-one does admit that she struggles with the loss of Niamhaposs hair, continuing: As her mother, I grieved for her hair and found the loss hard to deal with. I worried about her future, especially as a female with no hair. I always worry how she will be treated by others who donapost understand.  When Niamh first began losing her hair, she was donated a wig from The Little Princess Trust. However, she came to realise that this wasnapost the right option for her. Events manager Amy said: I did so much reading and so much research. I tried a wig when she was five, but she doesnapost want it anymore. It was too much for her tiny little features and it was would get hot and itchy. She loves to swim and hang upside down outside like a typical child and the wig got in the way so she said no. We tried head scarfs and sometimes she wears accessories for fun, but normally she prefers to not wear anything. We focus on all the positives. Face paint can go everywhere and she is the first to get ready for swimming, and of course, we never had to brush out painful tangles. Unfortunately, Niamhaposs family has had to contend with adults staring at her on a daily basis, with many assuming her hair loss is down to illness. According to Amy: Kids would call her baldy and some of the girls wouldnapost play with her. Wherever we go people stare. They assume she has cancer or a terminal illness Now she is older she can explain to people she isnapost poorly and I try and reassure people she is ok and her hair loss is not cancer-related, but Iaposve had strangers hug me and cry and give her money or sweets.

Itaposs about weighing up whataposs best for each person.Niamh has recently signed up to a number of modelling agencies, with the aim of embracing her unique look.

Paul Stratton was planning some downtime from his job at Liverpool Council, but after seeing devastating scenes of innocent Ukrainians being driven out of their homes by Russiaaposs invasion - he made a dramatic change of plan. The former cop and his brother made the -mile trip to to Przemyśl, in Poland, where Ukrainian refugees are arriving in their thousands - many of them without a penny or possession to their name. The pair will stay until Sunday before heading home, the Liverpool Echo reports.Though the brothers donapost speak the language, they are getting along with a Polish phrasebook and a network of former police and army colleagues. They recently met the Mayor of Przemyśl and asked what they could do to help. He told them to buy chocolate for the children as itaposs the only thing that makes them smile.So the brothers emptied out the local supermarket, buying £ of chocolate bars, which went in two minutes. Paul said: People are desperate to get something for their kids. And the children were so polite, saying thank you. It’s not dawned on them what’s happened.”  While many people are helping, more support is needed for the volume of people arriving from Ukraine.The reception centre in Przemyśl – which has been hastily set up in a nearby shopping centre – can only process , people a day. Paul said: We’ve given them four more laptops, doubling what they had to start with. And we’re desperately trying to get them faster broadband. Local boy scouts, who are brilliant on the computers, are helping to register people, though it’s dficult as they don’t speak Ukrainian.”  He added: There aren’t enough staff here. There’s no Red Cross or local government. The Polish people are wonderful, beyond heroes – they’re setting an example to the world of what it is to show humanity. The city streets are empty, as everyone is volunteering. But we desperately need more drivers, translators – and money.” The city’s railway station is packed with children, sitting on the floor, waiting. It’s too cold to go outside and play, as temperatures plummet to minus . Paul added: “I started out with sympathy, but it’s now turned into anger. I want to bring them all home to keep them safe.” Liverpool City Council Chief Executive, Tony Reeves, said: “I think it’s incredible what Paul has done to help in this situation, he really is to be commended for his selflessness, kindness and compassion. It is a wonderful example of public service and we should all be very proud of him.” Paul is planning toto Poland to volunteer for another week, later this month.

The crossing has irked countless drivers since it made the switch to a new cashless system in November.But Julie Barnett, from Kent, has now had a run-in with the new toll payment scheme despite never even passing through the Tyne Tunnel.Julie, who said she had to Google the underpassaposs location, said she was confused after receiving an Unpaid Toll Charge Noticefrom tunnel operator TT in December, reports Chronicle Live.The -year-old - who lives on the Isle of Sheppey - claims to have never been north of the Thames and has never visited the North East.  She believes that the automatic cameras installed to capture the registration numbers of vehicles driving through the tunnel misread one plate, seemingly mistaking a U for an O, and wrongly recorded her car as having made a journey. After immediately writing to TT to inform them of the error, Mrs Barnett received a letter of apology acknowledging the error on December . But she then received a final payment reminder notice in January, after which she wrote to TT again and got no reply, and has now been sent an enforcement notice from debt collectors telling her that she owes a whopping £.. Now that the toll plazas have been removed from the north side of the tunnel, car drivers must pay their £. crossing fee by midnight the next day – either online, with a pre-paid account, over the phone, or in shops with PayPoint counters. Those who fail to do so face a £ penalty that will increase to £, plus the original toll charge and extra administrative costs,not settled within  days. After Mrs Barnett got in touch with the Local Democracy Reporting Service, TT has said it will cancel her fine and blamed the problem on there being two UTCNs associated with her car rather than just the one that she had successfully appealed in December.The retiree, who has two children and one grandson, said the experience had been “very stressful” and complained that TT “make it easy to pay, but not easy to contact them”. She added: “I wrote to them in December to say this was not my car – the one in the picture has a dferent shape number plate to mine andyou look closely you can see it is a dferent registration. “They apologised to me, but then I got a final payment reminder notice in January. I wrote to TT again but did not get a response this time. “I thought it had been dealt with and they had forgotten about me, but then the next thing you know I am getting an enforcement notice telling me that I owe a lot of money – £.. “It has all been quite distressing.” A TT spokesperson said on Tuesday that, after investigating Mrs Barnett’s case, they found two UTCNs linked to her car – one that was cancelled in December and another that had been escalated to enforcement levels. They added: “However, since she has now brought this to our attention, we are happy to confirm that we have cancelled the second UTCN. “TT will always try to work with our customers to resolve any issues like this.” Almost , people have backed a petition slamming “simply unacceptable” errors with the new payment system and a surge in motorists being hit with heavy fines, while a councillor last week labelled the switch to the ‘Tyne Pass’ project an “absolute disaster”. Latest figures show that just .% of drivers going through the tunnel are getting fined for non-payment of tolls, but that still amounts to around , penalties being issued per month.

Benji, of Drumchapel, Glasgow, called  as his mum, Becky Garrett, drted in and out of consciousness before giving her one of his teddies so she wasn’t lonely. Becky explained that she doesnapost remember much of the day except for walking up and feeling horrendous, the Daily Record reports.She continued: “I was unable to take Benji to school and as the day went on, I gradually began to feel worse and worse. Due to having such a high temperature, I really wasn’t with it at all and from my understanding I was drting in and out of consciousness.”  Noticing how unwell his mum was feeling, Benji decided to call the emergency services.John McCue was one of three Scottish Ambulance Servicestaff members who attended the scene on Tuesday, January .He said: “When we arrived, Becky was lying on the sofa. She was responsive to voice, pale and said she was cold. When we checked her temperature, it was very high - more than  degrees. It was decided that she required further assessment at hospital. We ensured that Benji was with a responsible adult whom he knew before leaving for Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.”  John added: “Benji was his mum’s hero that day, realising that she needed help and being brave enough to call  and ask for an ambulance. When we were leaving for the hospital, Benji gave his mum one of his favourite teddies so she wouldnapost be lonely.”Benji visited the SAS base in Maryhill, Glasgow which is co-located with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, on Saturday, March .The six-year-old, who wants to be a firefighter when heaposs older, was rewarded with a tour of the fire station and bravery certicate. Becky said: “As you can imagine, this must have been so scary for a six-year-old to deal with but he did it and thanks to him I got the help I needed and have made a full recovery.” “I can’t even begin to describe how immensely proud I am of Benji - he really is my superstar. Although I have tried my best to make him aware of the importance of knowing what to do in an emergency, I am just so proud that he actually remembered and stayed calm enough to not only dial  but also had the initiative to phone a family friend to let them know I was unwell too.” Following the incident, Becky is now encouraging other parents to teach their kids how to call . She concluded: “If there’s one message you can take from this, it is to please try your best to make them aware of the emergency services number and when is appropriate to use it - it really can make all the dference.

Kate enrolled at the University of St Andrews in Fe, Scotland, where she studied the history of art.And while she has never been a big drinker, she threw herself into Freshersapos Week - a university tradition of welcoming new students with a week of nights out and partying - and earned herself an impressive nickname. Royal author Katie Nicholl shares stories of Kateaposs youth in her book Kate: The Future Queen, during which she claims Kate had hectic week of partying, meeting her aposuniversity parents - older pupils who were in charge of looking after freshers - finding her way around town and settling into her residence hall. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.Click here to sign up.Kate soon found her way around and was often seen relaxing in the common room, curled up in an armchair, a cup of tea in hand, either reading newspaper articles her father rather touchingly mailed to her or getting to know her fellow hall mates. Prince William also studied at the university and arrived the following week.He moved into the flat above Kateaposs and it didnapost take him long to notice the stunning brunette - probably because of the nickname she was given by her peers. According to Katie, she had been dubbed aposBeautul Kateapos by the end of Freshersapos Week.She writes: She was initially more reserved than many of the other young women, but her natural beauty was apparent. Tanned from a recent holiday in Barbados with her parents, fit from regular early morning run or swim, and dressed in her comfortable Hennes jeans, fitted sweater and signature cowboy boots, she radiated an outer freshness and an inner confidence. William reportedly worked up the courage to ask her to join him and his friends for breakfast one day. Of the moment, royal author Tom Quinn said: One of the funny stories is he was so desperate to meet her that as he walked towards her, he apparently tripped and said, aposOh thataposs a terrible start, youaposre going to think Iaposm a complete clot. Walks to class brought the pair together and it wasnapost long before their friendship turned into something more.

A year has now passed since Meghan and husband Prince Harry sat down with the chat show host for an explosive interview, where they made a number of claims about their time as working members of the Royal Family. Before the interview, there were numerous reports that Meghan made Kate cry during a bridesmaid dress fitting in the lead up to her wedding to Harry.But during her one-on-one with Oprah, Meghan claimed it was actually Kate that made her cry. Meghan said she has now forgiven Kate, adding that sheaposs a good person and that Kate sent her flowers to apologise for the incident - although gave no details on what sparked the incident, and it is still not known for certain.Now, it is thought that Harry and Meghan could come to the UK in the summer to take part in celebrations for the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee. And according to royal author and editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, Ingrid Seward, the two women will be cordial - although Kate may never forget how she was treated. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .She told the Mirror: The Duchess of Cambridge will be cordial to Meghan. She will be sure to be photographed kissing or hugging her. She has to - that is part of her job. Her private feelings have to remain just that. Kate will not forget however how Meghan treated her. But she knows there is no point in prolonging a feud that has the opportunity of being repaired. The Platinum Jubilee is just that chance. If necessary, Kate will also try to be the peacemaker between William and his brother Harry.  Being royal is all about appearances, not private feelings. It always has been throughout history. It is what the Queen has spent  years perfecting and she expects her family to do the same.Not only was Kate mentioned in the Oprah interview, Harry and Meghan also made a number of claims about the wider Royal Family. They alleged that there had been conversations about how dark son Archieaposs skin would be, while Meghan shared that she had suffered from suicidal thoughts and claimed that she was denied help for her struggle. And Ingrid, the author of Prince Philip Revealed: A Man of his Century, believes although the interview will never be forgotten by the likes of the Queen and Prince Charles, they know there is nothing to gain from shutting them out of the Jubilee celebrations.She explained: When Princess Diana criticised her husband and his family in her Panorama interview, it was the end of not only her marriage but any kind of honest relationship with her husband’s family. I suspect that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are experiencing a similar situation.  Their explosive interview with Oprah will never be forgotten. Neither will the words from the Buckingham Palace statement on behalf of the Queen ‘Recollections may y.’ Harry’s public criticism of his father. His insistence on prioritising his own mental health over everything. His persistence on declaring the royal world into which he was born is ‘toxic’ does not endear the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to the Royal Family. But the Queen knows better than anyone there is nothing to be gained by open hostility. She is always prepared to forgivenot forget. Prince Charles is the same. They have little choicethey ever want to see Harry again, which of course they do. Harry needs Meghan to be included and she will be, whatever the family may feel about her privately. Both the Queen and Charles want to see their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. There is nothing to be gained by shutting them out and of course, they will be invited to the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. They may be guests not actual participants. But they will be there.

Yesterday, Camilla welcomed three female rowers, who crossed the Atlantic in record time, to Clarence House - the London home she shares with Charles - to mark International Womenaposs Day. They were joined by former male rower Tim Christian and were pictured chatting with Camilla in a sitting room at the royal residence. Behind where the guests were sitting, royal fans noticed a side table that was filled with lovely family photos.And one of them included a stunning black-and-white image of Meghan with Charles on her wedding day in .  When Meghan married Harry, Charles escorted the bride halfway down the aisle of St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor - and the framed photo appears to depict this.Other framed pictures on the side table appear to be one of Prince Harry at the Invictus Games, an adorable photo of Charles holding Prince George at his christening in  and a family shot taken at Prince Louisapos christening in . Earlier this week a new book claimed Meghan showed she was confident and independent and certainly not a blushing bride on her wedding day.

With her father unable to attend the wedding, Charles offered to walk her down the aisle of St George’s Chapel.Her reply was not quite what he expected: Can we meet halfway , she asked, according to a new biography of The Queen by Robert Hardman, serialised in the Daily Mail. The response was an indicator that this was no blushing bride, but a confident, independent woman determined to make a grand entrance on her own, the author notes.  Meghan has yet toto the UK since she and Harry quit as senior royals in early , and son Archie has also not been back for a visit. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghanaposs baby daughter Lilibet has never been to the UK or met her grandfather Charles or great-grandmother the Queen.Earlier this year, Charles is said to have offered an olive branch to his son by inviting him and his family to stay with him on their next trip over from America.He has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son. Royal sources confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months. One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children.

The  finds that there was ample opportunity at this stage for Revd Evans to give thought to including a change of clothing for conducting the baptism, which he knew at this stage was to be a full immersion using the bath. The  does accept that Revd Evans felt there was an urgency to the request and that this led him to take the unusual step of acquiescing to it and stopping off en route to his holiday to perform the baptism. We do not, however, accept that the degree of urgency was extreme or that it was perceived as such. The  said that the clergyman had ample time to consider what it would be appropriate to wear and that underwear is intimate apparel. It is qualitatively dferent to, and has dferent associations from, other forms of clothing or even of swimwear, it added. As such there is a loss of dignity by stripping down to underwear in the circumstances in which it occurred which is inherently inappropriate and unbecoming. There was no extreme urgency which might conceivably be imagined to justy a state of semi-nakedness and public display of underwear. In its sanction of the priest, who was the Vicar of Bromyard and Stoke Lacy in Herefordshire, the  removed him from office and prohibited him from exercising any of the s of his orders for a period of six months. It also imposed an injunction that he should complete training courses relating to safeguarding, appropriate working and pastoral boundaries prior to any recommencement of ministry. The tribunal also granted anonymity to those concerned in the allegations.

Darci Topping, a qualied nursery nurse, started work at Stepping Stones Nursery in the Lancashire village of Hoddlesden in February . A week later she told her line manager she was pregnant.The  year old - who was on minimum wage - was then subjected to aposnegative inferencesapos about her pregnancy by her managers, was quizzed about the babyaposs father and about her intention to go through with the birth. She was also apospressuredapos into reducing her hours as the Covid- pandemic hit and then made redundant out of the blue, the employment tribunal heard.But bosses at Stepping Stones Nursery had aposdressed upapos her sacking with a sham process because she was pregnant, the tribunal ruled.  Miss Topping, who now has one-year-old son Stanley, has been awarded £, after she successfully sued the nursery at an employment tribunal for pregnancy discrimination and unfair dismissal. The tribunal in Manchester was told qualied nursery nurse started at the nursery near Blackburn on February  in  on a -hour-a-week contract. A week later, on March , Miss Topping, from Blackburn, announced to her line manager Zara Costello that she was pregnant with her first child. A tribunal report said: A few days later, in the course of a discussion about her pregnancy, Ms Costello told her that Julie Mercer, the owner of the nursery, would aposcome round to itapos, and she mentioned the fact that Miss Topping was on probation. Other comments were made, including questions about whether Miss Topping was, in fact, going to keep the baby and whether that would be a good idea, and reference was made to Miss Toppingaposs partner or father of the baby at the time. As the Covid- pandemic hit days later and Stepping Stones Nursery became worried about finances, Miss Topping was told her hours needed to be cut to  a week and wasnapost given any consultation. She was forced to sign a aposhastilyapos typed up document agreeing to cutting her hours - but was the only worker to have her shts formally cut. Miss Topping was aposanxiousapos over the pandemicaposs impact on her health and whether or not she would have a job, the tribunal heard. She was placed on sick leave initially but then placed on furlough as well as other members of staff. However, she was the only one to receive  per cent of wages for  hours a week, rather than . Despite things being aposstableapos at the nursery, she was made redundant out of the blue while on furlough, leaving her aposvery upsetapos. Ms Costello even suggested she aposmight be better off on benefitsapos during the telephone call. The report said: By April , , the numbers of children attending the nursery each day had stabilised. Miss Topping was by then on furlough with other employees at no cost to the nursery. What happened then was that Ms Costello simply rang up Miss Topping and announced her dismissal as .From the evidence presented, the Tribunal considered that the nursery dressed up her dismissal by constructing a redundancy process which either never took place or took place after the nursery made its decision to dismiss her. Miss Topping launched legal action, claiming the nursery aposhad a problem with pregnant employeesapos. Employment Judge Marion Batten said: The Tribunal concluded that the decision to make her redundant was a decision targeted at her alone - she was pregnant and in light of the paucity of the evidence, it was apparent that was the only dference. There was no other credible explanation offered by the nursery. The tribunal had no hesitation in concluding that her dismissal was related to her pregnancy. Only she was dismissed. She was the only employee who was pregnant, and in the context of her treatment by the nursery since she told them, at the beginning of March , that she was pregnant. Following the case, Miss Stanley said she is aposglad to have won the tribunalapos. She added: It was very tough for me being made redundant at such a vulnerable point in my le while expecting my first baby which I wanted to be excited about. I do feel that I have got justice and I am relieved that the case is finally over.

The Bombardier Global  arrived at Farnborough airport in Hampshire on March  from New Jersey and was due to fly to Dubai yesterday.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps today said he temporarily banned it from carrying passengers and grounded it in order to investigate claims that it could be linked to Russian oligarch Eugene Shvidler.The billionaire oil tycoon is a pal of Roman Abramovich, the owner of Cha football club who is now selling the club after the UK first imposed sanctions against the oligarchs. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  A government source has said Mr Shvidler is free to continue his journey by other means, Sky News reports. However, a revoked foreign carrier permit and restriction of flying order will mean the plan will remain grounded in the UK until Attorney General Suella Braverman and the National Crime Agency carry out their investigation. The Transport Secretary has ordered the Civil Aviation Authorityto terminate the registration of planes owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast today Russian airlines and private jets had already been banned from the UK.He said: However there were potential loopholes and I also wanted to make the issue a criminal one, so last night I also signed a law which closes off some of those loopholes to do with trying to work out the ownership of some of these aircraft. There is one such aircraft on the ground at Farnborough that I have essentially impounded whilst we carry out further investigations, for the last few days.  Itaposs very important that we have the laws available to enable that to happen. The jet is registered to Luxembourg-based firm Global Jet Luxembourg, but who actually owns the private planes is often hard to find because it normally involves third parties. Today, the government brought in new rules making it illegal for any plane chartered or owned by Russians to enter UK airspace. Mr Shapps claimed Britain is the first country in the world to do so. All Russian commercial flights have been banned from UK airspace since the Ukrainian invasion began.It comes as Vladimir Putin could “flatten Ukraine ” despite his war ultimately ending in failure, Western officials fear. Officials also warned they have good reason to be concerned about the possible use of non conventional weapons - such as chemical weapons - by Russia.An official said: “We’re seeing some of the disinformation come out of Moscow about non-conventional weapons.  We saw this in Syria, the Russians starting that talk when they or their proxies were about to use those weapons there.” They added: “It’s a serious concern for us”. An official said: “I think it will end badly for Putin. That doesn’t mean it ends well for Ukraine at all. “This could end very badly for both. And saying it ends badly for Putin does not mean the Russians not getting into Kyiv, or doing fantastic damage to it with appalling humanitarian costs along the way.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BBCCivil Aviation AuthorityRoman AbramovichGrant ShappsVladimir PutinHospitalsPrivate jetsCrimeBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She rarely talks about her inner most thoughts and feelings, but sometimes instead uses her clothes, jewellery or even her surroundings to send what some believe are secret messages.Just this week while meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Windsor Castle, and royal watchers were quick to point out the beautul blue and yellow flowers in the background.Of course yellow and blue are the colours of the Ukrainian flag and it was seen as a tribute to the people of the country amid the Russian invasion. So what other secret messages has she seemingly sent in recent years  Here we take a look... Ukraine flowers  The most recent subtle message was of course the the blue and yellow flowers on display at Windsor Castle during an audience with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Mr Trudeau was in London earlier this week for talks on the war in Ukraine with Boris Johnson and Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte.Sources said that the small gesture of the flowers was a deliberate sign of the Queenaposs solidarity with the people of Ukraine.Later, at a press conference with Mr Johnson and Mr Rutte, Mr Trudeau confirmed he talked to Her Majesty about Ukraine. He explained: I can tell you in my conversation with her this morning she was as insightful and perspicacious as ever, very interested in whataposs going on. Brexit hat Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. In , the Queen attended the State Opening of Parliament wearing a vibrant blue hat that featured yellow flowers.At that time the debate surrounding the aftermath of the Brexit vote was raging in the UK and in her speech, which is written by the government, she outlined how the country was preparing to exit the EU. However, many people on social media couldnapost help but notice that her hat very much resembled that of the European Union flag.In , in her book The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe, the Queen dresser Angela Kelly insisted it never occurred to her the hat resembled the flag. Anniversary brooch During last yearaposs deeply personal Christmas message, the Queen paid an extraordinary tribute to her late beloved husband Prince Philip. Pinned to her dress was a stunning sapphire chrysanthemum brooch that royal fans pointed out she wore on many happy times with the Duke of Edinburgh - believing it was a tribute to him. Among the times she wore the brooch was on her honeymoon in  and to mark her rd wedding anniversary in . Red boxes Just last month, an image of a beaming Queen was released to mark Her Majestyaposs Platinum Jubilee year. It shows her at Sandringham going through papers from her red box, which she is sent everyday from the Government. And according to former royal butler Grant Harrold, it was signicant the boxes were included in the snap. He said on Tik Tok: People keep asking me do I think the Queen is going to continue with her work  Well in this photograph you see one of her official government boxes and of course this is the Queen doing her day to day work. I think this shows all of us that even though sheaposs now coming into her th year, sheaposs been on the throne  years, she is very much going to continue being a monarch. Lockdown message brooch  One of the most important address the Queen has given to the country in the past two years came in April .In it, she spoke of the unprecedented nature of the Covid pandemic being fought around the globe and promised we will meet again despite lockdown.For the speech, the Queen wore a beautul turquoise and diamond brooch that once belonged to her grandmother Queen Mary. It was later pointed out that stone is said to be one that promotes healing and love as well as enhances the powers of leadership. Cop outfit Last November, a bout of ill health meant the Queen had to pull out of attending the Cop climate change summit in Glasgow.However, she recorded a rousing video message where she urged world leaders to help protect the planet.For the speech, she wore a green dress, which is of course the colour of being environmentally friendly. She paired it with a rare a diamond and ruby butterfly which was gted to her upon her engagement to Prince Philip. And many believed it was her subtle way of paying tribute to her late husband, who had been heavily involved in environmental matters.

Probably some bus services affected with some journeys taking longer.”  Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir said: “Windy on Wednesday with gales towards the north west and also some heavy rain. Dry skies towards the south and the east.” She continued: “We could see severe gales for a time as the strongest winds extend to the far north of Scotland. We could even see some damaging gust across the east side of Northern Ireland again through the morning associated with that rain band with some heavy bursts.” At the same time it is likely to be a dry start to Wednesday across England and Wales before the rain moves in.  “This rain gradually pushes in and again these winds will be incredibly strong particularly through the north channel, said Ms Nasir. Now the cloud will come and go across England and Wales as well as eastern Scotland but some brighter weather, even some sunshine across eastern counties during the day. At the same time rain will slowly clip western part of Wales as well as the West Country, hanging onto that wet weather for Northern Ireland as well as western Scotland and an undercut of cold air will allow snow to fall especially above m. So west will see the strongest winds, outbreaks of rain, east temperatures will be C to C.  Maps from WXCharts shows that a couple of centimetres of snow can be expected in Scotland overnight going into Thursday.And BBC weather forecaster Nick Miller has also predicted snow that will come along with the gales.“Some severe gales, gusts up to -mph, could be disruptive before they ease,” he said.  This weather system weakens moving east over night and into Thursday on its back edge it will have some some snow towards the Highlands and southern uplands for a time. In the clear spells in north west Scotland and Northern Ireland as Thursday begins there will be a frost here and especially in Northern Ireland there is a risk of seeing some fog. UK forecast for the next  days Wet and windy in the west, drier in the east. Today: Low cloud across central, southern and eastern England breaking to allow sunny spells. A band of rain, heavy at times, will move slowly eastwards across Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and then western England. Severe gales across western Scotland at first. Tonight: Outbreaks of rain across some northern and western parts, though rain turning lighter and patchier. Dry with clear spells in the southeast, and also the far northwest where turning frosty. Thursday: Cloudy across many parts with patchy light rain and drizzle edging slowly eastwards. Brighter across some western areas. Turning windy in the west later. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Rather unsettled with outbreaks of rain at times for most parts of the UK, heaviest and most prolonged in western areas. Strong winds at times, especially along western coastal areas.

The £, three-bed homeaposs listing boasts that it must be seen and despite its plain-looking exterior, a browse through the photos inside soon reveals why. Photos showcase the owneraposs apparent disdain for neutrals or anything ordinary with flamboyant art, neon and clashing colours, gaudy textured gold walls, VIP toilet seats and even a giant face protruding through one wall.In the Rightmove property in Edmonton, Greater London, pictures show a bold colour palette of pillarbox red and lime green while another has multi-coloured marble-effect walls.In other areas a gold textured corridor can be seen.  The Rightmove listing, marketed by  Key Properties, advises that early viewings are aposhighly recommendedapos and highlights the propertyaposs high ceilings bathroom jacuzzi and gardens. The home was previously on the market in , before the vendor decided against selling.Online house hunters were stunned by the ostentatious interior design, claiming that some choices were apos migraine inducingapos - even likening the decor to something by world-famous graphic artist M.C. Escher. Property-hunter Sarah tweeted: Checking listings on Rightmove and I had to share this one. Dr Trudy Kearney tweeted in response: Oh my! Every photo gets better and better . Those walls!. Lenny Martin tweeted: Youaposre going to need to be a lot more specic about which particular walls... Sarah then replied : Those ones - no these! Oh wait, the ones that look like someoneaposs a huge fan of Escher!

The colour scheme inside defies the propertyaposs aposordinaryapos exterior and the decor is sure to ide opinion. A corridor with textured walls leads towards a stairway to the rest of the house. Some viewers may regard it as cool but others suggested something more conventional would suit a property of this type which is highly sought after in the area.  The description on the Rightmove website reads: We are pleased to present this fantastic three double-bedroom terraced house to the market with self-contained outbuilding. The property comprises of: three double bedrooms, mid-terrace house with self-contained outbuilding to rear of property with separate access from the street.

Families were traumatised after the aggressive monkey mauled the bird to death in front of young children. The creature apostransformed into King Kongapos and scaled a ft-tall structure at Chester Zoo. It snatched a passing bird out of the air and hammered it against its perch before eating the gull during a deadly five-minute battering.Bec Adamson was enjoying a aposlovely day outapos at the Chester Zoo with her son when he saw the monkey at the top of the pole, the Manchester Evening News reports.The -year-old began filming and captured the fearsome animal holding its prey by the head and repeatedly slamming it against the side of his enclosure.The monkey then even appears to aposlick blood off its fingersapos as the outstretched bird becomes limp. Startled Bec, who was also with former partner Jamie Stockall, , says the zoo animal then dropped the seagull, so it quickly climbed down to grab the aposinsidesapos from the carcass and take it away to eat. Despite the aposviolentapos ordeal, the mum-of-one claims son Dominik Minshull, five, was fascinated as it felt like the David Attenborough nature clips he loves so much. The hospitality worker posted her startling video to TikTok on Sunda and itaposs since been viewed more than two million times. Bec, from Northwich, Cheshire, said: It was like watching the real King Kong. He was really slamming it against the pole and pulling at its feathers. It was just really aggressive and mad  Weaposd just been to see the rhinos, so we were walking across, then I saw all these seagulls circling and then this monkey caught one as it was flying past. It was really clever. I told Jamie and Dominik looked too, so I started filming. When I zoomed in I could see he was battering the f**k out of this seagull. I couldnapost believe I was catching it on video. Her TikTok post, sarcastically captioned aposlovely family dayapos, has been liked , times and has attracted more than , comments. She added: Other people started watching too and suddenly there were about  people watching. It was really violent, but itaposs natural. Itaposs what happens in nature. Dominik askedDavid Attenborough was watching as well because we watch this sort of thing at home. He just thought it was amazing because he thought they were fighting. It could have scarred him for le. If I was his age, Iaposd have been terried. I think Iaposm raising a psychopath. Iaposve seen the comments on my video saying itaposs like the next King Kong movie. I noticed he was licking his fingers. He was really enjoying his meal. When the monkey dropped the seagull he slid down the pole so quickly, then it was pulling its insides out before he pulled it back into the cage. There were loads of seagulls flying over the top but he just picked that one. Poor thing. You canapost help but keep watching. Weaposre all like little psychopaths watching this seagull getting mauled, but we want to find out whataposs next.

According to the Department of Justice for the Southern State of Georgia, Oudomsine was awarded an Economic Injury Disaster Loanfor ,after claiming to own a small business that supported  employees. The loans, which were created as part of Congress’ pandemic relief plan, were intended to be used for businesses to pay workers and rent.  However, once Oudomsine received the money, the Department of Justice said he used ,of it to buy a first-edition, shadowless and holographic Charizard card. The collectable, which had a . gem mint rating, was sold at the PWCC marketplace for that price in late December. “Like moths to the flame, fraudsters like Oudomsine took advantage of these programs to line their own pockets,” said David H. Estes, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia. Mr Estes said Oudomsine and others like him would be “held accountable” for his greed. U.S. district court judge Dudley H. Bowen has now ordered Oudomsine to pay , , on top of the ,in restitution and three years in prison. Oudomsine had also agreed to turn the Charizard card over to prosecutors.

And while everyone has dferent tastes, itaposs ultimately up to the bride to decide how she wants to look. But one bride-to-be on Reddit has discovered her mum has a lot to say about the way she wants her daughter to style her hair on her big day - as sheaposs demanded the woman cut her long curly hair because she hates it.Sharing her story anonymously, the woman explained her younger sister suffers from alopecia and that has encouraged her to grow out her own hair as much as possible so that she can have it cut and donate it to charities that make wigs for children every few years.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. And while she plans to donate her hair this year, she wants to wait until after her wedding in September - which has caused arguments within her family. She said: I have long, thick curly hair. My younger sister has alopecia, and over the years has lost most of her hair. Growing up, it always killed me that I could grow hair so easily and she couldnapost, and I saw the toll it took on her emotionally. Just imagine going through puberty with little to no hair. So ever since I was a teenager Iaposve been growing it out and donating it to a charity that makes wigs for children. I usually do it every couple of years, on my birthday in May.  Recently, Iaposve gotten engaged, and weaposve decided to get married in September. Since I wanted to donate this year anyway, I decided to wait until after the wedding - I figured that I could donate more and there are less donations of curly hair anyway so it just made sense. The woman said her mum is determined to get her to chop off her hair before her wedding, and has gone radio silent on her since she refused to do so. She added: My mum was not pleased when I told her. Sheaposs never been a huge fan of my curls as she says theyaposre too frizzy, unruly, and messy. She hates that I refuse to cut, dye or straighten my hair because I want to keep it as healthy as possible. A couple of days ago she told me over the phone that I would aposhave to come to terms with the fact that youaposll have to cut off your hairapos and I got really upset. I told her that Iaposm a grown woman, itaposs my head, itaposs my wedding and Iaposll be doing what I want. The conversation awkwardly petered out and Itaposs been radio silence from her ever since. We usually talk or text every day, so I know sheaposs upset, and now Iaposm thinking I should have just agreed and waited a few months to seethings calmed down. Commenters on the Reddit post were largely on the womanaposs side, as many of them couldnapost understand why her mum would have any issue with her hair. One person said: Thataposs one the weirdest demands Iaposve read about weddings or hair for that matter. Who caresyou have long hair at your wedding  While another added: Itaposs your body. Not only do you always have a right to say no, but your mother is also just horric for saying any of this. Enjoy your hair at your wedding.

He was browsing the range by Valspar, when he noticed some of the names of colours seemed to be rather aposrude innuendosapos for anuses. These included names such as aposdeep channelapos, aposdeep in the abyssapos and apospassagewayapos. The -year-old was left cracking up over the sample colours and shared a snap of it on Twitter, where his post quickly went viral.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.His tweet read: If anyone ever needs a nickname for their anus, I recommend the Valspar sample shelf at BQ. So far his post has been liked more than , times with users claiming Valsparaposs creative department could be trying to sneak the innuendos into their projects without customers noticing. Mike thought his apossillyapos finds, which also included apospeaceful placeapos and aposeye of horaceapos, were hilarious - despite his partner Kirsten Rampton, , looking on disapprovingly. Others on Valsparaposs website include aposporthole viewapos , aposcool boxapos , aposfar and wideapos , and aposoh la laapos . One Twitter user replied to his post saying aposIaposve got a selection here tooapos before sharing samples of aposgateway archapos, aposplump raisinapos and apossettling inapos.Another shared a colour called aposI feel youapos, then gave social media users a look at images of his aposrudely namedapos shades of orange aposripe peachapos, aposmi casaapos, and aposcarnelian charmapos. A third wrote: These have to be Photoshopped, right  Otherwise it means there were creative meetings to come up with these names. Someone  posted: aposBacheloraposs buttonapos is pretty bad too. Someone has been having a giggle at the Valspar offices. A dferent user agreed, adding: Someone, somewhere in the bowels of a paint company is going aposbugger, Iaposve been rumbledapos. While a sixth praised Valspar, commenting: LOVE Valspar colour names. What a class job that is. aposChateau Rothschildapos is going up in our spare guest room. Mike explained: I saw aposbacheloraposs buttonapos and immediately thought that could be a silly name someone could call their bottom. It made me laugh so much. I was admiring the many hundreds,not thousands, of colours they had on offer, and a few of them really made me laugh. Theyaposre as wholesome or as rude as youaposd like them to be. I brought out my childish humour, but Iaposm glad the one we picked wasnapost one of those. To come up with thousands of names, youaposre obviously going to paint yourself into some corners and wear out a few thesauruses and they go off-piste a little bit. Fair play to them. The dad continued: I think itaposs dficult not to go a bit doolally when youaposre naming your seven-hundredth colour. Youaposre bound to end up with a few silly ones because they canapost all be turquoise. The dark blue ones were funny, like aposmurky depthapos and aposMarianaaposs trenchapos. I didnapost realise so many people would have their own examples too. Writer Mike, who recently released a book called Open In Case of Emergency, picked aposfairy festivalapos for his four-year-old daughteraposs room rather than one of the aposrudeapos colours.

Thankfully, help is at hand in the form of expert cleaning guru Sarah Dempsey, who swears that you can make your house spotless in just  minutes flat. Sarah - who is employed as a cleaning expert for MyJobQuote - has advised readers to clean little and often to avoid having to spend an entire day doing housework, offering a range of top tips to do just that.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Speaking withThe Sun,Sarah suggests starting with the messiest jobs so as to establish priorities, keeping on top of heavy-use areas such as your bathroom and kitchen.According to Sarah, the best way to do this is to make sure to wash up in the evenings, leaving items to drain and air dry, before putting them away in the morning. She explained: This breaks up the task. And it saves you time drying up and reduces the need to keep washing tea towels. Sarah also encouraged people to wipe over their hob after every use, just before it cools down, noting that this preemptive measure makes it much easier to remove food residue.  When it comes to y tasks - like doing the shower and bath - Sarah recommends doing this in two parts to make things easier, taking a few minutes to cover surfaces with a cleaning product, before leaving this on as you go about other tasks or activities. She said: When you come back to it, you should be able to wipe it over with minimal scrubbing and then simply rinse it off. This will take you no longer than ten to fteen minutes of your time. Sarah has also stressed the importance of timing when doing jobs around the house, suggesting doing one bathroom job before hopping in the shower, such as cleaning the toilet or changing the towels. According to Sarah: Doing one thing keeps on top of the cleaning yet only takes a few minutes of your day. With her final tip, Sarah urges readers to clean as you sleep, meaning there are plenty of chores that can be left to sort themselves out once youaposve started them. For example, by putting a cheap, push-on version of a flexible shower attachment on your bath taps, or leaving things to soak overnight while you get some well-deserved rest.Do you have a cleaning-related story to share  We pay for stories.

Casey Shaw, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, spent most of his childhood taking verbal abuse from school bullies, and even faced vile comments from adults, who would call him ugly or give him nicknames such as twiglets and fox p***.Random strangers would have no reservations about declaring that I was ugly and how disgusting being ginger was. It was very confusing and very alienating, he recalled. I was very young and could not understand why I was being targeted by such a wide range of people. I would rush home to my room and cry by myself. I didnapost confide in my parents because I was too embarrassed and I really didnapost know how to handle my emotions.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. However, the -year-old has since gotten his sweet revenge, as his red hair has gotten him countless dates and compliments as he got older.Casey credits his older brother and celebs like Ed Sheeran and Prince Harry for helping him accept his locks - which have since allowed him to go onto achieving a successful modelling career.He said: About  years ago something happened – the vibe changed almost overnight. I donapost knowit was the popularity of Ron Weasley, the rise of Ed Sheeran or the coming of age of Prince Harry but all of a sudden, it seemed that gingers became a hot commodity.The abuse changed to compliments and my hair would be a conversation-starter instead of a finisher. In my mid to late s, I had a very active dating le and was very much spoiled for choice, especially when I moved to London. I have even hooked up with people because they said they had aposnever been with a ginger beforeapos. Many women in bars or pubs often ask ‘does the carpet match the drapes’ andI’m feeling in a particularly cheeky mood I will turn the awkwardness back on the questioner. Iaposve never taken offence [to women liking me for my hair] and have always been more than happy to oblige. It was about time being ginger paid off to be honest.However, the -year-old actually has a girlfriend and she too first fancied her beau thanks to his ginger locks. Casey said: My partner absolutely loves my ginger curls and credits them with attracting her attention in the first place. Standing out from the crowd definitely helped get me that coveted right swipe. My partner is sporting a big beautul black afro with ginger tips, complimenting my orange glow and giving us aposmain characterapos energy wherever we go. Casey comes from a family of gingers – all but his father – and is now proud of his unique appearance. He added: My mother is ginger and I have two siblings, both of whom are redheads. My brown-haired father would always mention how the household had such a aposfieryapos temper and atmosphere! My brother is seven years my senior and he helped me a lot when it came to how I dealt with what I now see as abuse. At the time it was just a normal everyday inevitability, especially in my town.Now, I love who I am. I enjoy my iniduality and embrace my uniqueness. My red hair makes me feel special, like being kissed by fire makes me one of the chosen people. Being ginger is a true blessing. Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Just a month later she was sitting up and by the time she was six months, Zoey had taken her first steps - months before babies normally hit the development milestone. Amy, , from Ohio in the US, was completely taken aback and admits she didnapost think it was possible for children to walk so earlier. Her two older children, Ashlyn, , and Lily, four, didnapost take their first steps until after their first birthday. Amy, who works in an escape room, said: “I was so shocked by how quickly Zoey was developing. I didn’t think it was physically possible.“She looked too small to be walking.“She is a little spitfire who is very independent.She will climb and jump on everything.”Amy credits the pandemic lockdowns for Zoey’s ability to start walking at such a young age. She said: “I was unable to work during the lockdown as my workplace was shut so we were at home a lot.“I think Zoey has wanted to chase and play with Lily from the moment she was born. All of us being at home definitely helped with her development. By eight months she was running around after Lily. It was incredible to see as she was so tiny! “I am so proud of her. “She is such a clever little girl.”Do you have a story to share  Get in touch at webfeatures@trinitymirror.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Parenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The ‘Turkey and Beef Duo Sunday Roast’ was served at the Greene King owned Channings Hotel in Bristol and cost one unlucky diner £..Remaining anonymous, they said that the image on the menu looked great, but the food that was brought out was very disappointing. They got three overdone potatoes, just one piece of caullower cheese, and an odd-shaped chunk of stuffing in a Yorkshire pudding - alongside overcooked meat. What do you think about the roast dinner  Let us know in the comments... A barrister, who uploads to Twitter as WelshGirlAbroad, said that her student daughter was given the depressing looking dish while out with her friends, and she shared a photo of the meal - which was met with dismay - online.She wrote: So this is what Greene King serves by way of award-winning roast dinner at Channings in Bristol. She was with three friends. They didn’t like to complain, thought they’d be assumed to be students trying it on.  They’d had to pay in advance on an app. I’ve seen better in hospital. Soon she was inundated with comments from people who agreed that the food served looked terrible. Linda Caswell wrote: Iaposve just come out of hospital and the food was great. Their chicken dinner knocked this into a cocked hat.” Chris Dale replied: There’s not much our dog would decline to eat, but I think you’ve found it. Mark Savage said: That is not a roast. Fellow barrister Francesca Gardner said: Oh that’s depressing. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Someone  posted: That is dreadful. Another friend asked: What. Is. That  Do they think youcan’t see andhave no appetite  While someone  proclaimed: That is one of the worst meals I have ever seen. Wow. The barrister complained to the pub chain owner but said they needed a week to look into it. She added: They apparently need up to seven days to decide whether it was acceptable to serve this or not. The response had best be worth the wait. The production description for the ‘Turkey and Beef Duo Sunday Roast’ on Greene King’s website reads: “Served with roast potatoes, seasonal vegetables, caullower cheese, sausage meat stuffing, a Yorkshire pudding and rich gravy.” A spokesperson for the Channings Hotel said: Unfortunately the roast dinner served to our customer was not to the usual standard we strive to provide to all of our customers. We are currently looking into what happened to ensure this does not happen again.We have already spoken to our customer directly to apologise and offered to welcome them back for another meal so we can make it up to them.

She even wrote a note and placed it inside, which read, Here is some garbage for the piece of trash stealing my packages, before putting a new delivery label on the sealed box.

The expert has dedicated several years studying the old spy photographs of the Middle East. His work has even featured in documentary ‘The Le of Earth: The Age of Humans’ - and says the snaps from  years ago could hold some very important answers. Dr Casana feels the images are invaluable because the countryside in the Middle East was far less industrialised when they were taken.  He said: “We were able to document something like , previously unknown archaeological sites that, through the history of  years of archaeologists working in the Middle East, no one had ever documented.” Having started as a small settlement in the seventh millennium BC, Tell Brak evolved during the fourth millennium BC into one of the biggest cities in Upper Mesopotamia.That included parts of northwestern Iraq, northeastern Syria and southeastern Turkey. A small settlement first emerged at the site in circa  BC, with pottery found at the site dating back to then. Excavations and surface surveys have revealed that Tell Brak developed as an urban hub slightly before better known cities in southern Mesopotamia such as Uruk.  It grew to around  hectares by the late fth millennium BC, and had more than doubled in size to  hectares in the period spanning  BC to  BC. Tell Brak expanded again around  BC, when it became known as Nagar, and served as the capital of a regional kingdom. For a settlement like Tell Brak to appear as it did, the environment needed to have been transformed by some form of dramatic event. The last ice age ended around , years ago, causing the Earth’s climate to change radically. The planet was at its warmest point in , years. Where Tell Brak lies is an area of the Middle East known as the Fertile Crescent, the culmination of the ice age allowed this area to finally become fertile. Rainfall and temperatures increased, leading to a great expansion of grassland, and climate change fuelled a food revolution.Rainfall and temperatures increased, leading to a great expansion of grassland, and climate change fuelled a food revolution. For millennia, humans had foraged wild grass seeds, but now, wheat and barley proved easy to grow and to control. Ancient humans began to settle and to nurture and protect their crops. These people started to abandon their hunter-gatherer lestyle, instead opting to become farmers. Human reliance on cultivated plants and domesticated animals changed the landscape forever from this point. These settled populations expanded, overwhelming the remaining hunter-gatherers, and transformed the landscape with their fields, villages, towns and eventually cities. A ‘tell’, in Middle Eastern archaeology, is a raised mound marking the site of an ancient city. In ancient times, houses were built from mud, which would crumble easily when exposed to the elements. Earlier debris would be levelled off in the rebuilding process and new buildings would be erected on top, so most tells are typically shaped like a low truncated cone. At over  metres high, and  by  metres in area, Tell Brak — or Nagar as it was then — is one of the largest in the area. It is believed to have thrived under dferent peoples right up until circa  BC when it was destroyed by the Assyrians.

Image: YouTubeByJoe Smith:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsA family have put a microphone on their three-year-old daughter to capture her hilarious commentary as she skis.Toddler Adia Leidums can be heard singing little songs to herself as she skis through thick woodland. Three-year-old Adia speeds down mountains on her tiny toddler skis in Fernie, British Columbia.Her parents Erich and Courtney say theyaposre teaching her to ski at a young age in order to build her confidence and resiliency.Adia’s parents, Erich Leidums and Courtney Haeusler decided to mic-up little Adia as she honed her skiing skills into on the slopes at Fernie Alpine Resort and after uploading her skiing videos to YouTube, her pep-talks are now world famous.“I got the idea a couple of years back from a hockey dad that mic’d up his son at a practice to catch his narration and self-monologue,” said Erich, who said Adia’s self-talk was well worth capturing. “We would hear those things before we mic’d her up, she would say those things. “When I was using my go-pro without the mic, I would try to get closer to her, and after she fell and got up sheaposd have something to say to the camera but I always had to get really close.“With a microphone it doesn’t miss anything she says. Any sigh, laugh or giggle- it’s pretty adorable,” he told theTerrace Standard . Erich’s of his daughter’s cute downhill antics have racked up millions of views over on his YouTube channel. Adia is the youngest of Erich and Courtney’s three children, along with Lucaand August , who’ve all been skiing for around  months.They’re all accomplished skiers, and feature heavily in Erich’s videos of skiing Fernie Alpine Resort as part of his ‘That Mountain Le’ videos on YouTube and Instagram.The couple have said they aim to be anti-helicopter parents and placed their children on skis at a very young age. “Our goal is to raise confident, caring children who are self-aware and I think that comes with taking risks,” Courtney said.

The ­desperate families squeezed in, standing, sitting, lying wherever they can, next to their precariously piled ­belongings, packed into the dank underground space they now call home. There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

The startling admissions were revealed by Daily NK, a newspaper with sources inside the country, based in neighbouring South Korea. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  Since Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine, more and more party cadres in North Korea say Pyongyang can never abandon its nuclear weapons, the paper reported. North Korea is apparently growing more attached to its nuclear arsenal since the crisis in Ukraine.The consensus among high-ranking North Korean cadres is that the Ukraine crisis began when Kyiv abandoned its nuclear arsenal. Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog After the fall of the USSR in , Ukraine held about a third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, but it gave the weapons up in  in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, Britain and the UK.It comes as satellite images showed new activity at North Koreaaposs Punggye-ri nuclear testing site, which was last used for a detonation in  before it was officially shuttered in . The International Atomic Energy Agencyalso reported on Monday that there was building work at the Yongbyon nuclear power plant, which produces material for nuclear weapons.  For Lee Yang-goo, the former South Korean ambassador to Ukraine, Russiaaposs invasion deals a fatal blow to any prospect of denuclearisation. Speaking to NK News, a specialist publication focusing on the secretive state, he said: North Korea already did not have much willingness to denuclearise. But looking at the graphic scenes coming out of Ukraine, Pyongyang will further solidy their internal and external justication for possessing nuclear weapons. Now, after this crisis, it will be dficult for any country to make a denuclearisation pitch to North Korea.  North Koreans think that nuclear weapons are the absolute saviour of the country. The signs of unease among the North Korean elite appear at odds with the countryaposs official position on the conflict in Ukraine - which is that the US is to blame. In a UN vote on March , North Korea was one of only four countries to vote against a resolution condemning the invasion. Chris Ogden, a senior lecturer in the School of International Relations at the University of St Andrews, said Pyongyangaposs position was more about mollying Russia than condemning Ukraine. I am not surePyongyang has any reason to openly scorn Ukraine, he said. I think that these statements are more about maintaining some linkages with Moscow and doing its best to maintain these relations. In this sense, Ukraine could be any other country in the region. What matters more to North Korea is to support Russia and to couch this support in terms of ongoing western imperialism as a threat to Russiaaposs national sovereignty - which Pyongyang also fears. The example of Ukraine is not the only reason North Korea fears giving up its nukes. Pyongyang already viewed the denuclearisation of Libya in  as a cautionary tale, noting how NATO later intervened there in , leading to the death of its leader, Muammar Gaddafi.

Author Ben Judah profiled Putin in  for his book Fragile Empire: How Russia Fell in and Out of Love with Vladimir Putin. Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog He normally begins his day with a large omelette or bowl of porridge - with some cottage cheese and quail eggs on the side. After this, author Steven Lee Myers claims that the Russian president drinks a juice containing beetroot and horseradish. The organic ingredients are sourced from the farmland estates of the Patriarch Kirill, Russiaaposs religious leader.He then has a post-meal coffee before swimming for two hours, with author Judah claiming he gets much of Russia’s thinking done, during this time.  He then finishes his workout with some weight-lting - with the leader keen to emulate a macho image to the public, while rolling news plays on the TV. During this time, he is mostly alone, author Steve Myers claims, writing: His closest companion seemed to be his black Labrador, Koni, who waited poolside as he completed his laps.Itaposs early afternoon when Putin reportedly turns his attention to his daily briefings - which includes articles from Russian and international media, as well as domestic and foreign affairs.  Judah wrote: He is obsessed with information. The thickest, fattest folders at his request are not intelligence reports: they are press clippings. His hands first open the Russian press digest. The most important papers come at the front: the obsequious national tabloids. These matter most, with their millions of readers. But it was reported in  that he tries to avoid computers, in favour of paper documents and a telephone. And he reportedly rarely uses the internet, although his advisers may show him a satirical video mocking him from time-to-time. After his late start, heaposs reportedly a night owl and stays up into the early hours working. And at weekends, he keeps busy, with studies, although he also tries to play as much ice hockey as possible. He also keeps a strict schedule abroad - with everything he uses, such as toiletries and bedsheets, replaced over security fears.And he will never accept food that hasnapost been tested first and avoids drinking alcohol, Politico reports, except during formal receptions.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Refugee Daryna Sarig told how the Spitz, named Marcel, cuddled up to her when she was curled on the floor in “terror” as explosions hit her building in Kharkiv last week.The pet’s owners had fled the country and abandoned him, but Daryna could not bear to leave Marcel, and brought him as she boarded a train alone to cross into Poland on Wednesday morning.Her loyal companion has been “protecting” Daryna after she was forced to leave her parents and grandparents in the city, where Russian invaders have launched more than  attacks in the past  hours.Speaking to the Mirror as snow fell in Przemyśl, the -year-old said: “Marcel saved me so now I must save him. I was really scared hiding in the basement of my building, it was cold and completely dark for two of the days with not much food. We spent seven days there in total.“We could hear rockets outside, and I was down on the ground when Marcel came to me. I was shaking, stressed and so scared. I thought we would die and our building would come crashing down. He came to me, he made me calm. If it wasn’t for him I do not know how I would have made it through.” The IT worker was forced to leave loved ones including her grandparents, who are too frail to travel, and her father who at  is within the age range for military conscription. Weeping, she said: “They wanted me to go, but I cannot describe how it feels to leave them. I am so scared for them.”  Daryna is now travelling to Warsaw to meet her sister Maria, , who is studying in Poland. “She has always wanted a Spitz and she doesn’t know yet that I have brought Marcel. She has been so worried about our family so this is going to be a special surprise for her.” Her story is one of the scores of heartbreaking tales as it emerged that some million people have now fled Ukraine, according to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. In a country of approximately  million people, that’s about . percent of the Ukrainian population.  Among those to flee is little Stas Kozak, who marked his second birthday by crossing into Poland with his mum and grandmother at am on Wednesday morning. Last year, the lad turned one with his family around him at their home in Uman, central Ukraine, with “music, cake, flowers and dancing” to celebrate, his mother recalled. Today, mum Lena, , held back tears as she told how Stas will not be able to see his dad, Sascha, a firefighter who has had to stay in their home country to help citizens there.  His grandmother Luda Panchenko, , clung to the boy in zero-degree temperatures at Przemysl rail station, as Lena explained: “Stas is very tired, very cold and very upset. He misses his dad.” A video they had taken of a bomb-hit street near their home in central Ukraine taken on the first day of the Russian invasion shows an abandoned bike with what appears to be blood stains nearby. “There is shelling and gunfire but for now, thank God, our homes are okay,” family friend Anastacia, who is travelling with them, said.  Student Martin Ma was not so lucky, after he fled his home in Kharkiv - hours before it was hit by an explosion. Dramatic footage shows his apartment block engulfed in smoke, and the -year-old told how he feels “terried” to think of what would have happened had he not escaped. Martin, a Chinese national who has studied in the country for two years, had boarded a train out of the city with two friends just three hours before. The student, who completed his Masters degree two days before Russia invaded on February , added: “We had to run because every day I was waking up to the sound of a bomb, there was gunfire everywhere - I even picked up a bullet, though I threw it away before crossing here.“It took a day to get on a train because so many people were trying to escape, it was horrible. “My family in China are so scared for me, they have been telling me to get out.”  Yesterday, the World Health Organisation warned that Ukraine was running out of vital medical supplies. The government in Kyiv said Russia had broken an agreed ceasefire, prompting further fears for those hoping to flee.“The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor,” the Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook, adding that the Russian army “did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city”.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON UkraineRussia Ukraine warRefugeesRefugee crisisDogsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

builds at the end of last year, with more than £, set aside for a full-size pitch and changing facilities.Councillor Norman Hampshire, council leader and ward member, revealed that that was just part of the proposals being brought forward, with the scheme tying in with nearby Hallhill Sports Centre.He said: “We are looking to create a new pump track and skate park along with changing rooms for the football pitch and a community cafe.“It would be a multi-generational facility however, in the evening it will be available for the young people to use.“They can come and watch television, potentially have a game of pool or other activities.”Funding is already in place for ious aspects of the ambitious project.However, there are still obstacles to be overcome.A planning application will be needed for the changing rooms, cafe, skate park and pump track.Youngsters will play a key role in the design of the skate park and pump track, with funding applications then being submitted to ious bodies.The planning application is expected to be submitted at the beginning of April, while work on the football pitch and play area could get under way within a matter of months.Mr Hampshire was hopeful,matters progressed smoothly, that work could start on the building this summer, and the skate park and pump track at the end of the year.The council leader felt that the proposed facilities would have a number of benefits to the community.He said: “People complain about young people hanging around and doing things they should not be doing and we want to give them something positive they can do.“My own vision is the cafe will be open from am to pm and we will be the operators of it but also I would like to have youth workers basing themselves within the cafe and going out into the community where young people are.”Mr Hampshire highlighted the plans during a virtual meeting with Dunbar Community Council.He said that a lot of work was still to be done, both on the site and in offices, in order to get the proposals off the ground.Mr Hampshire said: “It is a lot of work still to be done but we have made really, really good progress.“The woodland area is in pretty poor condition and there has never been any management taking place.“We have got some work to be done.“Drainage needs to be improved and some of the poor trees will probably have to be removed from there.“There was some damage done by the wind and that has got to cleared out.“Some of the ditches in there have been filled and never been kept clear – all that is management which needs to be done.“There is still wildle in the woodland and we will do everything we can to make sure we protect that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"grange-road-closed-two-days-resurfacing","story":"The entirety of

But I do hope that this time round, when sending out appointments, they will have some regard to where people actually live.For the first booster shot last year, many Edinburgh folk were given appointments at out-of-town centres, far from their homes, and often dficult to reach by public transport. In my case, I needed three buses to reach the vaccination point. The actual jag took just a few minutes, but the travelling took the entire afternoon and early evening.Ironically, there was a vaccination centre within walking distance of my home. But despite several phone calls and website visits, it proved impossible for me to change the appointment.By contrast, I recently went online to search for the nearest branch of a certain high street retail chain. The companys website had no dficulty in matching my postcode with that of their local shops. Could the health boards not use similar technology to match appointments with vaccination centres Mike Lewis, Edinburgh.CRATE EXPECTATIONSLIKE some of your correspondents, I wont see my seventies again. However, I developed an appetite for reading as a young child during my primary school years in a small village school in Ayrshire.Le in the s was hard – at home my father had thedelivered. I devoured that, not always understanding what I was reading. I looked forward to reading Rupert Bears daily adventures with Bill Badger et al.There was no local library. However, I do remember, with affection, that we had access to a library of sorts. A wooden crate with rope handles was delivered to our small village school from Ayr County Buildings, library department. This contained a selection of books – for adults as well as for children.The headmaster, Mr DG Smith, waited after school on a Thursday afternoon to enable interested pupils to borrow a suitable book, and to obtain books for parents in addition. However, as the crate of books was not changed very frequently, I reached the stage of reading whichever book was new territory for me.I well remember, on one Thursday afternoon, the boy in the queue in front of me saying to Mr Smith in a loud voice: \"Twae murders and a love\" – and these were duly handed over. Presumably they were an order for his parents at home.I have never forgotten the pleasure I experienced from being able to borrow a book – any book – in those wartime days. Because of those early years and the encouragement I received from my teachers, I became greedy for books. That desire has never left me.I maintain that for any educational or literary success I have had during my long le, I owe so much to my early formative years to my late headmaster, and the crate of available books which arrived periodically from the local authority library. I am also thankful that I did not experience the distractions which are available to todays children – the internet has its vast benefits, but also its negative influences.Amy Kinnaird, Ochiltree.FACING TROUBLE WITH THE BUS PASSI READ with interest Joanna Blythman’s article . Alas, the use of facial recognition technology now also extends to online applications for Saltire Cards giving entitlement to, among other things, free bus travel for the over-sixties.I recently attempted to apply for this online. The instructions listed the documentation which would need to be uploaded, including a passport or driving licence with photo and an additional passport-style photo. What wasn’t included in the instructions at the start, but should have been, only became apparent well through the process, when I was informed that my face would now be biometrically scanned. This was clearly unnecessary since both a photograph and a passport with photo were available. Because my desktop computer does not include a camera, the application could not proceed and I had to revert to a booked appointment at my nearest local council offices where the documentation was presented and my photo was taken with a domestic digital camera.My Saltire Card arrived two weeks later with a vertically squashed photograph.

I thank you for having supported me so far. Thank you, my neighborus,” Mr Yoon said. He was expected to make a formal victory speech soon.Mr Yoon is to take office in May and serve a single five-year term as leader of the world’s th largest economy.Earlier, Mr Lee, a former governor of Gyeonggi province, conceded his defeat at his party headquarters.“I did my best but wasn’t able to live up to expectations,” a glum Mr Lee said. “I congratulate candidate Yoon Suk Yeol. I sincerely ask the president elect to overcome ision and conflicts and open a new era of unity and harmony.”The election boiled down to a two-way showdown between Yoon from the opposition People Power Party and Lee from the governing Democratic Party. They spent months slamming, mocking and demonising each other in one of the most bitter political campaigns in recent memory, aggravating the country’s already severe domestic isions.Critics say neither candidate has presented a clear strategy for how they would ease the threat from North Korea and its nuclear weapons.They also say voters are sceptical about how both would handle international relations amid the US-China rivalry and how they would address widening economic inequality and runaway housing prices. vw,vw,px, px\"Lee Jae-Myung Mr Yoon says he would sternly deal with North Korean provocations and seek to boost trilateral security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo.Mr Yoon has said he would make a enhanced alliance with the United States the centre of his foreign policy while taking a more assertive stance on China.After North Korea’s latest reported ballistic missile launch on Saturday, Mr Yoon accused North Korean leader Kim Jong Un of trying to influence the results of the South Korean election in favour of Mr Lee.“I wouldhim some manners and make him come to his senses completely,” Mr Yoon told a rally near Seoul.Mr Lee, for his part, has called for greater reconciliation with North Korea and a diplomatic pragmatism amid the US-China confrontations.The election comes as South Korea has been grappling with an Omicron-driven Covid- surge. On Wednesday, health authorities reported , new virus cases, a record high. People infected with the coronavirus voted after regular voting ended Wednesday evening.South Korea’s Constitution limits a president to a single five-year term, so Mr Lee’s party colleague, President Moon Jae-in, could not seek re-election.Mr Moon came to power in  after conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached and ousted from office over a huge corruption scandal.With conservatives initially in shambles after Mr Park’s fall, Mr Moon’s approval rating at one point hit % as he pushed hard to achieve reconciliation with North Korea and delve into alleged corruption by past conservative leaders.He eventually faced a strong backlash as talks on North Korea’s nuclear programme faltered and his anti-corruption drive raised questions of fairness.Mr Yoon had been Mr Moon’s prosecutor general but resigned and joined the opposition last year following infighting over probes of Mr Moon’s allies.Mr Yoon said those investigations were objective and principled, but Mr Moon’s supporters said he was trying to thwart Mr Moon’s prosecution reforms and elevate his own political standing.Mr Yoon’s critics have also attacked him over a lack of experience in party politics, foreign policy and other key state affairs.

The findings by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchpredict that all regions in the UK will see extreme poverty rise by more than % in the coming year. According to the BBC, poverty levels in Northern Ireland are estimated to rise by a staggering % in the year ahead, bringing ‘the total number of destitute households to about ,.’ OFTEC, the trade association for the liquid fuel industry, is offering households advice on how to keep homes warm and costs low: Only heat the rooms you are using. Turn down inidual radiators in rooms you are not using to save money. If you have thermostatic radiator valves these can be lowered to number one for low background heating. Also, in the rooms you use regularly, ensure radiators are not blocked with furniture as this reduces their effectiveness. The temperature in hallways and bedrooms should be cooler, ideally between  –  degC for persons in good health. Turn the thermostat down by one degree. You can reduce your heating bill by up to % by lowering your room temperature by just one degree.  Identy the benefits available to you: The Government has introduced financial help including the Winter Fuel Payment. Those eligible could receive between pound and pound to help with heating bills. The deadline to make a claim for winter  to  is  March . Search NI Direct for further information. Energy Efficiency Upgrade: Check with your local councilyou qualy for the Affordable Warmth Scheme that aims to assist those in fuel poverty with boiler replacements upgrades and insulation measures. In addition, you can review the many grants that are available for energy upgrades as part of the NI Sustainable Energy Programme – this info can be found on the Utility Regulator’ website. Any energy efficiency improvement will reduce heat loss and save you money. Speak with your energy provider. Always speak with your distributor and agree a payment plan for your energy needs. We would always recommend you use a Member of the NI Oil Federation as their members have signed up to the Consumer Council’s Customer Charter which gives consumers a vehicle for redress should an issue arise. OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings said: “Living in a cold home can be both physically and mentally harmful. No one should have to decide between eating or staying warm, but that is the reality that many are now having to choose between. “We would urge the Government to consider that these are choices currently being faced, as the Decarbonising Heat Consultation approaches.  will be a decisive year that will outline how people will heat their homes going forward in efforts to reach net zero targets by . “Both the Republic of Ireland and England have actioned plans for decarbonising this sector already. Northern Ireland has the benefit of being in a position that allows us to review and reflect on these approaches. “In ROI, the Government are offering a grant of up to  per cent of a deep retrofit, however the average cost is €,, which leaves a large bill for the homeowner to finance, and we don’t see how the savings offered will cover the remaining payments. Similarly, England has offered a pound grant towards an air-source heat pump, however the total bill is expected to be between pound, and pound,. “At a time when households are feeling the pressures of rising costs, it would be unrealistic for the Northern Ireland Government to expect a similar approach to incentivise households to decarbonise. “Heat pumps and retrofitting will be the right choice for many living in a thermally efficient or recently built house, but for those facing financial dficulties and living in an older, colder home, there must be options considered that won’t leave them behind on the road to net zero. “Heating oil is currently used in over , homes in Northern Ireland. A recent analysis by the AECOM engineering company showed that biofuels in home heating could achieve similar emission reductions to retrofitting, but at a much lower cost. The current biofuel being touted as the replacement for kerosene is Hydrotreated Vegetable Oilthat offers an immediate c.% reduction in carbon emissions. “Our message to local Government would be to examine every option available, and to keep low carbon options and no regret pathways on the new Assemblys agenda when considering the heating consultation later this year. A one size fits all approach must be avoided.” For more information, visit https:www.oftec.org "},{"url":null,"title":"eco friendly alternatives seven everyday household items you can easily replace","story":"Smiles better: durable and reusable bamboo toothbrushesGetty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSmiles better: durable and reusable bamboo toothbrushesClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFrom plastic free toothbrushes to reusable makeup remover pads, there’s an easier way to make eco-friendly choices in your home.And now that the focus is on going green and becoming a more conscious shopper, many local consumers are trying to decide what to swap, change and consider when it comes to being more eco-friendly.Making the sht to a more sustainable household isn’t as much of a daunting task as it seems, according to UK-based online retailer OnBuy which has provided the Belfastwith some examples of simple and effective everyday swaps for your home. rolls of Plastic free Eco Three ply toilet roll: £.

It’s a prime area for sustainability and bioersity and where that can be promoted.“We got a group put together and prioritised things. We put it into dferent areas, so ‘Action to Learn’ was the first element, then it was ‘Action to Communicate’, ‘Action to Protect’ and then ‘Action to Encourage’. Those were the four areas we looked at to see what we could do in our club.”From ‘Action to Learn’, they targeted learning about the plants, animals and insects they were surrounded by. They have a well-worn walking path around the club and created a Fairy Trail for children. The local Men’s Shed group cut out ‘fairy doors’ that the children on the club’s summer scheme were able to paint in dferent county colours.Read MoreDeclan Bogue:OpinionMickey Moran may be leaving Kilcoo, but he has a lot left to offer the GAA in a mentor roleEdwin Poots backs GAA Green Club programmeDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up On the walk, bird boxes were installed to encourage more wildle and that also became a means to engage the children in competitions.Lamh Dhearg, and Margaret, have embraced the scheme with a gusto you can only admire. They have encouraged children not to bring single-use plastics, and have a refill area. They have planted trees in association with the Belfast Hills Partnership.They have mounted flower beds and planted daffodils, they have picked litter and put up signs and bins everywhere, and they have let areas ‘go wild’ with their ‘Sow, Don’t Mow’ idea.Right now, they have a few badgers and hedgehogs around the place. The odd fox, too. Kids on the edge of the city are becoming comfortable with having a slug on their finger.“I know schools are promoting all of this, but it’s when kids see it in real le,” Margaret explains. “If you are out there in the outdoor space, you can show the colours of autumn, the colours of leaves, how they fall, go into mulch, help the earth and the ground and soil and the wild flowers regenerating.“It’s about promoting sustainability and green awareness and encouraging green education.“We did and are doing things that will always be in motion and we will roll them out over a number of years.”A much more urban area is Strabane, where club volunteer Ciaran McLaughlin laughs that having had little interest in gardening, it’s growing all the time through his Sigersons club.Through the Dermot Earley Initiative, they have planted  trees. They left a patch of land behind some goalposts completely uncut and as the summer rolled on, found themselves amazed at the buzzing and insect noises.“Another angle was around climate change and how we all burn our energy and how we can become more energy efficient,” explains McLaughlin.“By coincidence we had done our energy audit as part of the Green Club project and then Sport NI came into the club before Christmas with their ‘Building Back Better’ project.“That’s about climate change, the environment, ‘greening up’ your club. We applied because our system was old and it brought us up to date. We changed all the radiators, all the thermostats, the lights, switched to LEDs, and the electrics all around the building, all brought up to date with that grant.”And, of course, it saves money too. Strabane have also cut down on plastics, and planted flower beds. They have picked litter out of the grass and spent time educating children about recycling.At the far west of the province lies Belcoo O’Rahilly’s on the very edge of Lough MacNean. It may be one of the most physically stunning venues of Ulster GAA.Their representative, Tom White, has a background in network engineering and a passion for the environment, campaigning locally against fracking.“On things like energy and stuff like that, we are in the middle of doing our floodlighting and it is a no-brainer that you use low-energy LEDs and stuff like that. An awful lot of stuff of this is a no-brainer and the way to go,” says White. “People do not understand how much they consume.”He actually believes as worthy as the initiative is, it does not go far enough in its current guise and believes the GAA should take a signicant stance on environmental issues that might even seem political.“Even with trying to cut down on plastic bottles, it is still signicant. When you talk about environmental stuff, the pitch still has to be fertilised. There has to be weed control, pest control, which are all chemicals and then areas have to be strimmed and mowed. There are all aspects of things that the GAA needs to look at and see how we can best do it,” he explains.“One of the problems in Northern Ireland is we are the dirty corner of the UK, Ireland and Europe. We don’t have an environmental authority and we don’t have a Climate Act. The latest report on our lakes and rivers, of our  surface bodies of lakes and rivers, said that our water quality is good. And this is in a country that tries to say we are green!“As community groups, we need to be fighting about that, not just going along. We cannot have business as usual.”The  clubs contacted to take part have been on a fact-finding mission as much as anything . What they have learned will soon be spread to all units.It’s a solid start.Launched in December , the GAA ‘Green Club Programme’ is seeing  clubs and two regional venues explore a range of sustainability projects designed to enrich their physical and social environments.A number of partners came on board, such as the County and City Management Association, as did the Ladies’ Gaelic Football Association and Camogie Association, to take part in the scheme.The launch was conducted virtually. Speakers included Eamon Ryan of the Green Party and Edwin Poots MLA of the DUP.The Green Club Phase One participants were selected from  clubs that responded earlier that year to a questionnaire designed to gauge interest in developing a Green Club initiative. The responses highlighted a wealth of sustainability work already being undertaken by GAA units and a desire to further contribute to the green agenda while future-proofing their communities and facilities.Phase One began in December  with the intention of amassing as much practical learnings from the participating clubs and venues as possible.This will inform the creation of a GAA Green Clubs toolkit that will be made available to all GAA units on the island , replete with useful case studies, established partnership models and funding avenues.Minister Poots said at the launch: “When it comes to the environment it is only by working together that we can create the behavioural change that is necessary to manage our climate change and environmental risks.“The GAA’s five thematic areas of energy, waste, water, bioersity and transport align well with my department’s Green Growth objectives. The challenge I am setting is for Northern Ireland to use Green Growth to change behaviours and to turn climate change from an economic threat into an economic and environmental opportunity.“I believe the Green Clubs initiative has the potential to be a real catalyst for change, harnessing the energy and enthusiasm of not just the young players on the pitch. It draws in the club officials, their supporters their families and their communities. I hope my department will be able to continue to explore with the GAA those areas where we can guide and support activities.”At present, the scheme is compiling feedback from those at the coalface, with the intention to gather all of their experience and take it to all GAA units.Related topicsGAAMore On GAA PremiumOisin McConvilleOpinionTailteann Cup will be a failureteams are shown the same disrespect mine was last month PremiumDeclan BogueOpinionGAA must do more to tackle sectarian abuse faced by Ulster playersAll-Ireland Championship ‘green proposal’ passed by overwhelming majority at GAA CongressStephen Sheridan explains the secret behind Armagh’s Division One title tilt ahead of Mayo clash PremiumDeclan BogueOpinionGAA bringing in Ladies’ football and camogie is a logical step, but it presents issues that must be addressedMost ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutDoctor hid fact that hip surgery on -year-old patient who died was unnecessaryFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsSchools# Cup hockey final: Amy Hunter goal gives Methody the win over Royal School Armagh as heroics #up there# with cricket world recordWatch: Robbers steal £k of bikes in planned raid on Moneymore family shop Cicli SportTop VideosPlayMethody win Schools# Cup beatingRoyal School Armagh in tense final PlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockLatest EnvironmentEdwin Poots backs GAA Green Club programmeRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityLatestDavid Moyes wants European qualication to be regular for ‘new West Ham’People said my win made them super proud to be from NI, says drag race winner Blu HydrangeaIreland better than NI in terms of le expectancy and infant mortality: reportMSPs back economic crime BillIrish President Michael D Higgins reflects on ‘depths of conflict’ while marking anniversary of Abercorn bomb,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGreen Party NI leader Clare Bailey pictured.March   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPoliticians are increasing recognising that immediate and decisive action on the climate crisis will not only influence votes — it will win votes.Indeed, for many Northern Irish voters, climate action will be one of the defining issues in the upcoming MLA elections in May.With these elections fast approaching, many candidates have already started leafleting and door-knocking. However, when a candidate knocks at your door, what questions should you ask them  More importantly, how do you know whether they are genuinely serious about what they propose To gain a deeper sense of the candidate’s knowledge and understanding of climate breakdown, begin the conversation in the context of the broader political landscape.There are currently two climate bills passing through the Northern Irish Assembly. These are subject to ongoing debates, reviews and amendments. Both bills have a target of net zero emissions. Yet while the Private Members’ Billaims for Northern Ireland to be net zero by , the Executive Billaims for .Read MoreClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsYou could therefore start by asking the following question: which bill do they support Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Given how both bills aim for Northern Ireland to be net zero, despite ying target dates, a good follow-up question would be to ask how their party hopes to achieve this. How will they get us there  What is their political strategy  What concrete steps will they take to help Northern Ireland reach net zero Northern Ireland is not only the last nation in western Europe to implement climate legislation, but we also rank th worst in the world for bioersity loss. Nature recovery is therefore integral to an ambitious climate strategy.It is therefore crucial to ask the candidate about how they plan to halt and reverse nature and bioersity loss. How will they promote regenerative agricultural practices  How will they create more spaces for nature  How will they prevent the decline — and potential extinction — of our valuable species and wildle There are also three sectors in Northern Ireland which could be uniquely affected by the climate crisis: agriculture, energy and transport. These three sectors are vastly dferent. However, what unies questions regarding the future of these sectors is the principle of ‘just transition’.‘Just transition’ is the idea that we should not moveto a low-carbon, environmentally-friendly economyit means sacricing justice or ‘fairness’. A just transition recognises that, whether it be people on low incomes or workers in the fossil fuel industry, no one should be left behind in the creation of a ‘greener’ society.To take energy as an example, fossil fuels like oil and gas remain the primary source of heat and power in Northern Ireland. We already know that fossil fuels are harmful to the environment, and they will not help us to reach climate targets. Beyond asking candidate about renewable energy systems, we must therefore go one step further.We need to ask candidates about how they will compensate for workers in polluting industries, who may find themselves without a job in a more sustainable world. What incentive schemes will they promote  How will they re-train or upskill iniduals  How will government invest in this The same is true for agricultural and transport sectors. Will there be grants or public goods for farmers who dedicate areas of land to rewilding or regenerative practices  Will there be further investment in public transport infrastructure, particularly in rural communities  How will government incentivise citizens to support ‘greener’ lestyle choices that are typically more expensive, like buying an electric car or fitting solar  at home Lastly, ask the candidate seeking your vote about what is important to you.Whether it be plastic pollution or food waste, this is an invaluable opportunity for you to ask the candidate about a specic topic that you care deeply about. This could be an ongoing problem in your local area, or a global issue which causes you concern.Raising more personal questions with candidates may subsequently elicit a more direct response from them.Elections are a rare opportunity for citizens to shape environmental policy, and focus political attention on the most defining issue of our generation: the climate crisis.Climate change will be related to every social issue on each political party’s manesto – from gender equality to healthcare.Voting for candidates who support ambitious environmental policy solutions is therefore arguably the most important action that citizens can take.Remember this when candidates come calling.Related topicsEdwin PootsClare BaileyClimate ChangeClimate BillMore On Edwin PootsFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Greens call for independent environmental agency in NI after Poots announces English office to extend its remit to Northern Ireland PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionConservative farmer Edwin Poots parachutes into liberal south BelfastEdwin Poots confirmed to replace Christopher Stalford for south Belfast seat PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsMost ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutDoctor hid fact that hip surgery on -year-old patient who died was unnecessaryFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsSchools# Cup hockey final: Amy Hunter goal gives Methody the win over Royal School Armagh as heroics #up there# with cricket world recordWatch: Robbers steal £k of bikes in planned raid on Moneymore family shop Cicli SportTop VideosPlayMethody win Schools# Cup beatingRoyal School Armagh in tense final PlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockLatest EnvironmentEdwin Poots backs GAA Green Club programmeRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityLatestPeople said my win made them super proud to be from NI, says drag race winnerDavid Moyes wants European qualication to be regular for ‘new West Ham’Ireland better than NI in terms of le expectancy and infant mortality: reportMSPs back economic crime BillIrish President Michael D Higgins reflects on ‘depths of conflict’ while marking anniversary of Abercorn bomb,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ultimately, though, I think one of the simplest changes we can all make is to buy less and reuse more.“Before shopping in the sales, let’s ask ourselves whether we really need it. And when we spring clean, let’s ask our friends and familythey want our unused items before we take them to the tip.“Valuing our stuff and treating it with respect will help us get more le out of it, and the longer we can make use of something the better.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Here are  simple ways Moate suggests children can start to re-use ‘stuff’ and help the environment…. Create a ‘reuse bin’You may already have separate bins for rubbish and recycling, but Moate stresses that lots of our recycling can be reused before we get rid of it. “Why not start a reuse bin ” she suggests. “This can be a place to put clean recycled materials that can be used again for things like arts and crafts.”. Become a water collectorMoate points out that in some parts of the world, fresh water is considered a luxury and a precious resource. “To help us conserve water, encourage kids to collect rainwater in old containers and use it to water the garden or house plants.”. Go on a rubbish rambleGrab a pair of gloves and a bucket, and go on a rubbish ramble, suggests Moate. “When litter ends up in our natural ecosystems it can be harmful to wildle and can take hundreds of years to break down,” she says. “We can do our bit by helping clean up our local environment when we’re out and about.”. Open your own bee caféBees will travel up to two miles in search of flowers loaded with nectar and pollen for food, explains Moate.“Over the years, we’ve destroyed a lot of our native wildflower habitats and this makes searching for food pretty exhausting for our pollinator buddies,” she says. “We can help them out by planting a bee café to help them refuel. A bee cafe is a one-pot stop for our pollinator friends no matter where you live.”Wildflowers bees enjoy include cornflowers, viper’s bugloss, poppies and dandelion, and Moate adds: “I really love bees, so planting wildflowers not only encouraged pollinators but also made my garden more exciting.”. Craft your own recycled paperYou’ll need: old paper, a bowl, water, tea towel and a rolling pin.How to do it: Get some recycled paper and tear it into tiny pieces, and then mix the pieces of paper with some water in a bowl, and squish it all together until it’s really mushy. Squeeze the mushy mixture into balls of pulp, and place each pulp ball on a flat surface and put a tea towel over the top, before using a rolling pin to flatten it and squeeze out the excess water. Leave the pulp to dry and you’ve made your own paper!. Construct a compost bin“Composting at home is great because it reduces the amount of food waste we send to landfills, which create huge amounts of greenhouse gas,” says Moate. “You don’t need to have a garden to start composting either, you can make a mini-compost bin in something as small as a plastic bottle.”You’ll need: an old plastic bottle, scissors, a pin, tray, brown green waste, a spray water bottle and kitchen towel.How to do it: Wash an old plastic bottle and peel off any labels, then ask a grown-up to help you cut the top off the bottle and use a pin to poke some holes in the bottom for drainage. Place the bottle on a plastic tray and add a layer of brown waste – like shredded paper, torn-up egg cartons and crunchy old leaves. Spray the brown layer with water till it’s damp, but not too soggy, and then add a layer of green waste – like vegetables, food scraps and grass cuttings. Place the tray and composter somewhere warm like a sunny windowsill, and give it a stir every day and add a little more water to help micro-organisms break the contents down into compost.Lay a sheet of kitchen towel over the top to keep it damp, and continue to add layers of brown and green waste, but remember it will take time for everything to decompose. When the layers have transformed into compost, you can add it to the soil around plants to give them a healthy snack packed with nutrients.Stuff: Eco-Stories of Everyday Stuff by Maddie Moate, Puffin, £..

The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , led by Environment Minister Edwin Poots, and Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey have bills that have reached the consideration stage in the Assembly.Whichever bill emerges, it is clear that signicant change to our socio-economic model needs to occur to reach any of the proposed targets. In , Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be . million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Northern Ireland accounted for % of UK greenhouse gas emissions in , compared to approximately % of the UK population. Agriculture , transportand residential buildingswere the largest sectors in terms of emissions. Mindful of the need to address this and maintain a viable economy, Daera has produced a draft green growth strategy which is about creating more green jobs and protecting or re-purposing existing jobs where possible.An important part of the draft green growth strategy is the new energy strategy from the Department for the Economy. It notes an ambition to deliver energy savings of % from buildings and industry by  and meet at least % of electricity consumption from a erse mix of renewable sources by .While the legislation may be edging forward and strategies are emerging, the current Northern Ireland report within the latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment makes for sobering reading. The Government is required by the Climate Change Act  to conduct such an assessment every five years to inform the UK National Adaptation Plans for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The assessment covers  specic risks and opportunities in detail across themes such as infrastructure, health, the natural environment, international dimensions and business and industry.Taking the business and industry theme, issues such as increased flooding of business sites, increased levels of coastal flooding, access to finance, worker productivity and disruption to supply chains could all be at risk from climate change.For example, the annual bill for damage for non-residential properties in Northern Ireland is expected to increase by % by  due to flooding events. The expected annual damages for UK business properties from coastal flooding is expected to increase by % by .The Climate Change Risk Assessment also suggests that there is a risk that access to finance, investment, insurance, and capital for businesses are negatively impacted by climate change through decline in availability and affordability of insurance, a reduction in the value of assets and investment and increased credit risks and cost of capital.Across Northern Ireland, this is currently a medium risk, but it has the potential to rise to high magnitude in future.With these potential risks fast approaching, finding a path to net-zero is crucial. The net-zero carbon roadmap produced for Belfast is enlightening in this regard. Currently, % of Belfast’s emissions come from the domestic housing sector, with transport responsible for % of emissions, public and commercial buildings for % and industry %.Belfast’s roadmap includes an assessment of the potential contribution of approximately  energy-saving or low-carbon measures.I don’t think anyone knows where the money is coming from to pay for these initiatives, but it may be the case that a slowness to act has brought us to the point where we can’t quibble on the cost.Andrew Webb is chief economist at Grant ThorntonMost ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutDoctor hid fact that hip surgery on -year-old patient who died was unnecessaryFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsSchools# Cup hockey final: Amy Hunter goal gives Methody the win over Royal School Armagh as heroics #up there# with cricket world recordWatch: Robbers steal £k of bikes in planned raid on Moneymore family shop Cicli SportTop VideosPlayMethody win Schools# Cup beatingRoyal School Armagh in tense final PlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockLatest EnvironmentEdwin Poots backs GAA Green Club programmeRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityLatestDavid Moyes wants European qualication to be regular for ‘new West Ham’People said my win made them super proud to be from NI, says drag race winner Blu HydrangeaIreland better than NI in terms of le expectancy and infant mortality: reportMSPs back economic crime BillIrish President Michael D Higgins reflects on ‘depths of conflict’ while marking anniversary of Abercorn bomb,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As a result, he has qualied both sets of accounts on the basis that this expenditure was “irregular”.He also concluded that INI’s financial statements did not provide a true and fair view of the substance of the transactions and he has provided an adverse opinion on Invest NI’s accounts on that basis.Both the department and INI were provided with an opportunity to adjust their accounts to resolve the issues identied by the audit. They both declined to do so as they do not agree with the independent opinion of the CAG.This disagreement has, in part, contributed to the lateness of certication and publication of the annual report and accounts of both organisations.Mr Donnelly commented: “My report acknowledges the speed with which these support schemes were designed and delivered.“It is important to stress, though, that the issues I have identied do not merely pertain to technical matters, but to fundamental principles and standards of accounting with which all public bodies should comply.”The report also sets out the CAG’s qualication relating to Covid- business support schemes administered by Invest NI totalling £. million in -.Based on how these schemes were designed, INI relied on self-declarations by applicants as evidence that certain eligibility criteria had been met, with no corroborating evidence. As a result there was “insufficient audit evidence” to confirm that expenditure was regular.These schemes were launched at pace in response to the continued impact of the pandemic on Northern Ireland’s economy.Approval for their implementation was granted by Ministerial Direction, since the Department’s Accounting Officer was unable to provide evidence that these schemes would provide value for money or that there would not be an unacceptably high risk of error or loss of funds.In addition, Mr Donnelly’s report on INI notes “irregular income and expenditure” relating to a £. million loan made in previous years to Glenmore Generation Limited – an anaerobic digestion facility.The Department of Financeconsidered this loan to be irregular, because certain conditions of its approval had not been complied with and further approval had not been sought.Irregularities were also highlighted in relation to a £.m payment to Tourism Ireland Limited, where again DoF approval was not obtained.Commenting on these qualications to the accounts, Mr Donnelly said: “It is completely unacceptable that a Department fails to comply with the requirements of primary legislation it is relying on to make payments.“This is a basic requirement, and it is extremely disappointing to see that the Department has failed to learn lessons from its past failure on obtaining approvals required for the Renewable Heating Incentive scheme.”INI published its - Annual Report  Accounts on Wednesday. They say the accounts have been qualied by the NI Audit Office in two areas – expenditure relating to NI Executive Covid emergency response schemes and expenditure relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility.Responding to the qualications Mel Chittock, Interim CEO, Invest NI said: “We acknowledge the decision of the Comptroller and Auditor General to qualy our accounts.“The global pandemic was an unprecedented situation which required implementation and operation of emergency schemes outside of normal process.“I am confident that all the necessary steps were taken to provide the best solutions to get much needed emergency funding to businesses. We complied fully with the instructions given to us and NIAO found no irregularities.”Addressing the qualication relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility in more detail, she said under the Sustainable Utilisation of Poultry LitterScheme INI provided funding towards the build and operation of two anaerobic digestion plants.“The aim was to help resolve a signicant local environmental issue and to help Northern Ireland comply with EU nitrates targets, as well as provide economic benefits by supporting growth in the agri-food sector,” Ms Chittock said.“It was always understood that the development of anaerobic digestion plants using innovative technologies was high risk. This risk was balanced against the environmental and economic benefits to the NI economy.“The Glenmore facility encountered technical and operational dficulties and in  the owner operator decided to refinance the business. As a result, Invest NI, and the main funder, will not receive aon the initial investment made.“However, the plant remains operational, is contributing to the objectives of the SUPL Scheme, and producing green energy for two NI manufacturing businesses.”A review highlighted that there could have been improvements in Invest NI internal processes and that it could have taken more steps to better mitigate and manage the loan investment in this project.However, the Department of Finance concluded that some of the conditions it put in place around the loan were not met, and now views the loan as an irregular spend.INI insists that it has tightened its processes and procedures and formed a new Invest NI Governance Council focussed on implementing best practice and improvements right across the organisation.DfE was contacted for comment.Most ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutDoctor hid fact that hip surgery on -year-old patient who died was unnecessaryFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsSchools# Cup hockey final: Amy Hunter goal gives Methody the win over Royal School Armagh as heroics #up there# with cricket world recordWatch: Robbers steal £k of bikes in planned raid on Moneymore family shop Cicli SportTop VideosPlayMethody win Schools# Cup beatingRoyal School Armagh in tense final PlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockLatest Northern IrelandIreland better than NI in terms of le expectancy and infant mortality: reportIrish President Michael D Higgins reflects on ‘depths of conflict’ while marking anniversary of Abercorn bombFirst victims pensions payments made while others continue to waitO’Neill urges PM to intervene over cost-of-living crisisAssembly passes integrated education Bill after UUP refuses to back petition of concernLatestDavid Moyes wants European qualication to be regular for ‘new West Ham’People said my win made them super proud to be from NI, says drag race winner Blu HydrangeaIreland better than NI in terms of le expectancy and infant mortality: reportMSPs back economic crime BillIrish President Michael D Higgins reflects on ‘depths of conflict’ while marking anniversary of Abercorn bomb,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

in terms of life expectancy and infant mortality report","story":" FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBy Rebecca Black, PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIreland performs better in terms of le expectancy and infant mortality than Northern Ireland, a new report has found.The research, carried out by the ESRI and the Shared Island Unit in the Taoiseach’s department, also found there are higher levels of unmet healthcare needs due to affordability issues in Ireland relative to Northern Ireland.The primary care systems of both jurisdictions were examined and analysis also sought to identy what comparable data are currently available on the two healthcare systems.The major dference between the two systems is the absence of a universal healthcare system in Ireland.In Northern Ireland, all residents are entitled to a wide range of health and social care services that are almost entirely free at the point of use, while in Ireland, a majority of the population pay for a range of healthcare services.These include seeing a GP and other primary care services.However the report found that despite the dferences, both systems are grappling with similar challenges including increasing demand for healthcare services, increasing expenditure and workforce shortages.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The research found that for both socio-economic and health status, the available evidence suggests that one system does not consistently do better than the other.However, in terms of some population health measures, including le expectancy and infant mortality, Ireland has performed better than Northern Ireland in recent years.In terms of potentially avoidable hospital admissions – which might have been preventedtimely and effective primary care was delivered – neither system consistently performed better than the other.The proportion of invited participants availing of a range of preventive services such as screening and vaccinations was also found to appear similar.Meanwhile there was found to be higher levels of unmet healthcare needs due to affordability issues in Ireland relative to Northern Ireland.However the report found long waits to access care in both jurisdictions, driven by the Covid- pandemic.Both jurisdictions saw a signicant increase in the proportion waiting more than  months for both out-patient and day and in-patient services, with this increase particularly evident in Northern Ireland.Between  and , for day and in-patient services, the proportion on the waiting list for more than one year has increased from % to % in Ireland and from % to % in Northern Ireland.But the report also found that a lack of comparable data on healthcare system indicators across Ireland and Northern Ireland “signicantly limits the type of analysis that could be undertaken”.It notes that signicant challenges in both systems, particularly around waiting lists and recruitment, “might provide fresh impetus for at least exploring the potential for greater cooperation in relation to health matters”, but added there is a need for “signicant reform in data collection and sharing”.Lead author of the report Dr Sheelah Connolly said the research suggests recent improvements in population health indicators in Ireland which have not been seen in Northern Ireland.“Similarities and dferences between the healthcare systems of Ireland and Northern Ireland provide an opportunity to examine how dferent systems and policies influence outcomes,” she said.“The analysis carried out for this Shared Island research suggests that there have been improvements in population health indicators in Ireland in recent years, which have not been experienced to the same extent in Northern Ireland.“Further research should be undertaken to understand the reasons for these dferences as this may provide evidence on how to improve population health.”Most ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutDoctor hid fact that

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands.

Stormont is broken and she will help lead the fight by Aontuacute to make the democratic institutions work.ldquoRosemary will also stand strong for the human right to le for everyone. She fully supports the integrated education sector but will fight for equality and parity of esteem in the education system, especially for rural schools and will oppose the Integrated Education Bill.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb. The clock ticked by with  minutes gone and both sides were now level.On  minutes Daniel Bell replaced Conor Carew in the engine room for The Mills and as the game heated up and became quite frantic around the  minute mark, McGivern was booked for two strong challenges in quick succession.As the game entered the final few minutes, Marc Reid made a top level save with an acrobatic reflex to push the ball onto the roof of the net when it didnrsquot seem possible showing shades of Gordon Banks.The away team were now pushing hard for the winner they craved and were blown up for an offside call on  minutes with Naseem Ouldhamiat through on goal.As the dust settled and a level of calm was restored the referee blew for full-time.A local derby which was keenly contested throughout and a draw was probably a fair result on the balance of play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"First half nightmare for Ballynahinch at home  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH lost out to Portrush on home soil in their latest Ulster Intermediate League encounter at the weekend.lsquoHinch began strongly and on the attack from the first whistle as Alex Millar was quickly able to play the ball out from the back and up to Matthew Martin.The Ballynahinch player played the ball up to Kyle Patterson on the left wing, who was able to slot the ball in off the back post to put his side on the scoresheet.Portrush were quickly on the counter attack down the right-hand side only to be stopped by Ashley Brown and lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell.Portrush were determined to level the game and were able to slip the ball from the baseline through a crowded circle before putting the ball in at the back post.Leslie Harrison played the ball out to Scott Leetch on the right, who was able to pass up to Craig Harkness and over to Michael Carney and Jason Campbell up front.They were able to create chance after chance, but were denied by the Portrush lsquokeeper and their defence.lsquoHinch came out in the second quarter looking to add to the scoreline.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August.

She said items are even thrown at passing cars in the townrsquos main streets.The discussion centred on the possibility of including Killyleagh in any further council bye-laws to prohibit drinking in public.The councillors urged the committee to contact the council to make them aware of the need for the bye-laws.BISHOPSCOURT ndash The owners of the former Bishopscourt airfield have outlined their plans to turn it into an international standard motor-cycle race track.Owners David Beattie and John Grfin believe the track can become one of the best circuits in Britain in the next two to three years.They pledged the former RAF base will be transformed over the coming weeks into a circuit as good as any in Ireland.And they have promised to bring over some of the top names in world motor-cycle racing, with the eventual target a world championship grand prix race.The duo gave a detailed outline of their proposals at a special press conference held in Strangford on Thursday night. It was ostensibly geared towards announcing the first race meeting at Bishopscourt for  years on March  ndash but as a result of the local controversy which has surrounded the project, they took the opportunity to answer many of the criticisms.Mr Beattie said: ldquoWe believe racing at Bishopscourt will put this end of the county on the map.ARDGLASS ndash A claim has been made this week that Ardglass fishermen will not benefit from a trawler decommissioning scheme announced by the Government.Local SDLP councillor Mr Dermot Curran says Ardglass trawler men will be allowed ldquovery littleany of the pound million which has been earmarked for the scheme.The pound million is intended to over the entire UK fishing fleet over a two-year period. The money will be paid to owners wishing to leave the industry, therefore reducing fishing capacity.Mr Curran said the money on offer is too little to help local fishermen.ldquoThere are  boats in Ardglass. A number of owners want to leave the industry, but this will not let them get out, he added.Mr Curran said Northern Ireland fishermen were in dficulty, with some living on the breadline.Accusing the

budgets then staff may be laid off.Addressing his schoolrsquos annual prize distribution on Wednesday night, Mr Hanna said it was wrong for schools to have to make the decision on how many teachers should be employed and their levels of pay.ldquoOn introduction the Government was at great pains to assure us that the purpose of LMS was to enable schools to decide their own priorities in the allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching unions and their demands for better promotion prospects and smaller classes, and it decided to off-load the problems, via LMS, on to inidual schools who now have to take the decision about class size,

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy. I am pleased that Downpatrick area councillors can work collectively for progress in the area, she added.Itrsquos understood that details of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised and that once the date of the K event has been confirmed, the event will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, those working to bring the event to Downpatrick say it has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost, bringing in many competitors from outside the town.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Recovery is possible to restore bond with you and eating food  ","story":"WITH the pandemic dictating to us over the last two years, there has been an increase for those struggling to manage their dficult feelings, sudden le changes, isolation and trying to gain a sense of control mdash which has resulted in an increase of cases for the treatment of eating disorders.Eating disorders, or a disordered pattern of eating, can arise when a person uses food to cope with painful situations or uncomfortable feelings.Problems with food develop when it is used for emotional rather than physical reasons, such as feelings of anxiety, anger or guilt. The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

The North Antrim MP urged the Treasury to make a temporary cut to fuel duty and VAT to help motorists in NI who he said are paying £ per week just to drive to and from work.The North Antrim MP said: “Within a rural area like Northern Ireland, many who work in our schools, hospitals and manufacturing have no access to public transport and depend on their car.”He said: “Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has written to Chancellor with serious proposals which would help working families. It is time for the Government to step up and address a problem which has been predicted for weeks.”Other proposals made by the DUP include cancelling the planned .% increase in National Insurance contributions and offering targeted extra support to households in greatest need.UUP leader Doug Beattie has written to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic asking for immediate action to bring about a reduction in VAT on energy costs across the United Kingdom.He said: “If this can be done, it will give the most vulnerable hope that we can get through this present crisis which will help the material and societal wellbeing of the people of Northern Ireland.”He added: “I am extremely concerned that energy prices are soaring exponentially throughout the United Kingdom creating real societal dficulty.”Sinn Fein leader Michelle O’Neill said the Tory government must do more support workers and families struggling with cost of living.She also blamed the DUP for “walking away” from the Executive thus preventing a budget from being set while also preventing ministers from taking further action. In a letter to PM Boris Johnson, Ms O’Neill called on the British government to abandon its plans to hike people’s taxes from April and to introduce a windfall tax on high-profiting energy companies.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I thank you for having supported me so far. Thank you, my neighborus,” Mr Yoon said. He was expected to make a formal victory speech soon.Mr Yoon is to take office in May and serve a single five-year term as leader of the world’s th largest economy.Earlier, Mr Lee, a former governor of Gyeonggi province, conceded his defeat at his party headquarters.“I did my best but wasn’t able to live up to expectations,” a glum Mr Lee said. “I congratulate candidate Yoon Suk Yeol. I sincerely ask the president elect to overcome ision and conflicts and open a new era of unity and harmony.”The election boiled down to a two-way showdown between Yoon from the opposition People Power Party and Lee from the governing Democratic Party. They spent months slamming, mocking and demonising each other in one of the most bitter political campaigns in recent memory, aggravating the country’s already severe domestic isions.Critics say neither candidate has presented a clear strategy for how they would ease the threat from North Korea and its nuclear weapons.They also say voters are sceptical about how both would handle international relations amid the US-China rivalry and how they would address widening economic inequality and runaway housing prices. vw,vw,px, px\"Lee Jae-Myung Mr Yoon says he would sternly deal with North Korean provocations and seek to boost trilateral security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo..removeMr Yoon has said he would make a enhanced alliance with the United States the centre of his foreign policy while taking a more assertive stance on China.After North Korea’s latest reported ballistic missile launch on Saturday, Mr Yoon accused North Korean leader Kim Jong Un of trying to influence the results of the South Korean election in favour of Mr Lee.“I wouldhim some manners and make him come to his senses completely,” Mr Yoon told a rally near Seoul.Mr Lee, for his part, has called for greater reconciliation with North Korea and a diplomatic pragmatism amid the US-China confrontations.The election comes as South Korea has been grappling with an Omicron-driven Covid- surge. On Wednesday, health authorities reported , new virus cases, a record high. People infected with the coronavirus voted after regular voting ended Wednesday evening.South Korea’s Constitution limits a president to a single five-year term, so Mr Lee’s party colleague, President Moon Jae-in, could not seek re-election.Mr Moon came to power in  after conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached and ousted from office over a huge corruption scandal.With conservatives initially in shambles after Mr Park’s fall, Mr Moon’s approval rating at one point hit % as he pushed hard to achieve reconciliation with North Korea and delve into alleged corruption by past conservative leaders.He eventually faced a strong backlash as talks on North Korea’s nuclear programme faltered and his anti-corruption drive raised questions of fairness.Mr Yoon had been Mr Moon’s prosecutor general but resigned and joined the opposition last year following infighting over probes of Mr Moon’s allies.Mr Yoon said those investigations were objective and principled, but Mr Moon’s supporters said he was trying to thwart Mr Moon’s prosecution reforms and elevate his own political standing.Mr Yoon’s critics have also attacked him over a lack of experience in party politics, foreign policy and other key state affairs. Mr Yoon has responded that he would let experienced officials handle state affairs that require expertise..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: South Korean conservative declares win in presidential race article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrom ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.Salted caramel Easter eggsThere is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. .removeI thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.The verdict: Which Aldi chocolate Easter eggs are worth buying From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website hereThe Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/19973551.taron-egerton-shares-health-update-collapsing-stage-west-end-play/res","title":"taron egerton shares health update collapsing stage west end play","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

This site demonstrates Council’s commitment to conserving and enhancing bioersity throughout the Borough and our commitment to protecting green space for the community.

Members endorsed the importance of the site in terms of the species present and the geological interest and were particularly impressed by the level of community and volunteer support that the site had attracted.Blackhead Path has become a Local Nature Reserve, which is a protected area of land designated by a local authority.\"Local Nature Reserves provide accessible nature on a communitys doorstep, and this site is great example of this, providing opportunity for health and wellbeing and giving people an opportunity to enjoy and appreciate nature.”Wide iety of bird leThe Friends of Blackhead Path have been working alongside the council and ecologists for the past year, surveying the site. \"We were pleased to see such a wide iety of bird le on and off shore including fulmar, curlew, lapwing, purple sandpiper, oystercatcher, dunlin, snipe, redshank and eider,\" Friends of Blackhead Paths Simon Wheeler said.\"We were also pleased to find a rare  spot ladybird, perhaps now only found here, as well as evidence of the Cryptic Wood White butterfly, which is a priority species. We will continue to work alongside Council and ecologists to improve the habitat on site and hope to increase the population over time.”Schoolchildren and Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Cllr William McCaughey at the path.The geology of Blackhead Path is also worth noting, said Ian Enlander from Friends of Blackhead Path. \"It is dominated by Palaeogene basalt, some  million years old, but rocks belonging to two older geological periods are sporadically exposed being Cretaceous limestone, approximately  million years old, and Triassic mudstones, approximately  million years old,\" he said. \"The Triassic mudstones can be seen at low tide. More recently, the effects of glaciation can be seen with the deposition of the large basalt boulders known locally as the Wrens Eggs. It is not clear how far these may have been transported, or indeed when they were deposited, but their scale clearly indicates that ice movement was involved. Most likely these date from the last advance of Scottish ice, some , years ago.”Read More Read MoreBlackhead Path attracting , walkers per monthCouncil  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularList of Northern Ireland roads closed due to fallen trees...NewsYoung Maghera man ‘lost control of himself’...NewsLarne woman pulled what turned out to be a ‘toy gun’ in ‘dis...NewsCourt hears of ‘mass brawl involving  people’ at wedding r...NewsPortglenone woman is alleged to have stolen £,...NewsMost PopularAir fryers UK : best ones for sale at Ninja, Currys and ...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statementcanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Granny had died before I was born but her recipes had been passed down through the family and baked throughout my childhood. She was very much a part of my upbringing and she had achieved that by baking her way into the hearts of those who knew her.Teacher Ciara McLaughlin has released a new cookery book, Bread and Butter.\"Baking was Granny’s way of nourishing, caring and loving and that’s something that you will definitely find in my family. You’re hardly in the door until the kettle’s boiled and a scone is plated up with butter and homemade jam. I think there’s an element of traditional Irish hospitality behind it but the same is shared by cultures across the world. Food has the power to connect people – even those who are no longer around –and that’s why I knew I had to write this book.\"The ’university project’ version of Bread and Butter, a small prototype of only  recipes, won runner up in the British Design and Publication Awards .It caught the eye of Michael O’Brien from The O’Brien Press, who offered Ciara a publishing contract for the book.\"I was responsible for every element in the book: the writing, the photos, the illustrations and the design,\" Ciara added. \"Plus I also teach full-time and run my designer baking business, Swallow Barn, so it was a very hectic year!\"When it came to the photography stage, I didn’t even own a camera but over the course of a few weeks I gathered together the necessary equipment and transformed our little outside barn into a makesht photography studio. I would dedicate my weekends to baking and photographing, write recipes late into the night, and called on my design skills when it was time to put the book together. Thankfully my family supported me with their talents as Mummy is a fantastic home baker and Daddy is an expert in graphic design.\"The  or so simple recipes that made the final book are carefully arranged to reflect the feel and flavour of the four seasons. \"Through my writing I wanted to weave in some of the stories that conjure the charm of Granny’s quaint farmhouse, along with tales of my own childhood to show how the recipes are almost this living and changing thing. The recipes in Bread and Butter are there as a starting point to help you fall in love with simple, homemade food and bring the joy of baking to everyone’s table.\"Bread and Butter can be purchased from The Book Nook and The Dairy in Larne, Nook Living and The Secret Bookshelf in Carrickfergus, as well as in-store and online with Waterstones, Easons, Amazon, and WHSmith. It is also available with The Book Centres, who voted the collection as their Cookery Book of the Month for March.Since the books publication at the end of February, Ciara has appeared on Highland Radio, where she made pancakes on a live Zoom stream.She will also be in Waterstones, Ballymena on Saturday March  from .pm-.pm to sign copies of the book and offer a demonstration on icing biscuits just in time for Mother’s Day.Ciaras business, Swallow Barn can be found on Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1646833844820.jpg--oftec_issues_home_heat_advice_as_fuel_poverty_rises.jpg?164683384600","title":"oftec issues home heat advice as fuel poverty rises ","story":"According to latest statistics, Northern Ireland is set to face a surge in the number of households in extreme poverty. The findings by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchpredict that all regions in the UK will see extreme poverty rise by more than % in the coming year. According to the BBC, poverty levels in Northern Ireland are estimated to rise by a staggering % in the year ahead, bringing ‘the total number of destitute households to about ,.’ OFTEC, the trade association for the liquid fuel industry, is offering households advice on how to keep homes warm and costs low: Only heat the rooms you are using. Turn down inidual radiators in rooms you are not using to save money. If you have thermostatic radiator valves these can be lowered to number one for low background heating. Also, in the rooms you use regularly, ensure radiators are not blocked with furniture as this reduces their effectiveness. The temperature in hallways and bedrooms should be cooler, ideally between  –  degC for persons in good health. Turn the thermostat down by one degree. You can reduce your heating bill by up to % by lowering your room temperature by just one degree.  Identy the benefits available to you: The Government has introduced financial help including the Winter Fuel Payment. Those eligible could receive between pound and pound to help with heating bills. The deadline to make a claim for winter  to  is  March . Search NI Direct for further information. Energy Efficiency Upgrade: Check with your local councilyou qualy for the Affordable Warmth Scheme that aims to assist those in fuel poverty with boiler replacements upgrades and insulation measures. In addition, you can review the many grants that are available for energy upgrades as part of the NI Sustainable Energy Programme – this info can be found on the Utility Regulator’ website. Any energy efficiency improvement will reduce heat loss and save you money. Speak with your energy provider. Always speak with your distributor and agree a payment plan for your energy needs. We would always recommend you use a Member of the NI Oil Federation as their members have signed up to the Consumer Council’s Customer Charter which gives consumers a vehicle for redress should an issue arise. OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings said: “Living in a cold home can be both physically and mentally harmful. No one should have to decide between eating or staying warm, but that is the reality that many are now having to choose between. “We would urge the Government to consider that these are choices currently being faced, as the Decarbonising Heat Consultation approaches.  will be a decisive year that will outline how people will heat their homes going forward in efforts to reach net zero targets by . “Both the Republic of Ireland and England have actioned plans for decarbonising this sector already. Northern Ireland has the benefit of being in a position that allows us to review and reflect on these approaches. “In ROI, the Government are offering a grant of up to  per cent of a deep retrofit, however the average cost is €,, which leaves a large bill for the homeowner to finance, and we don’t see how the savings offered will cover the remaining payments. Similarly, England has offered a pound grant towards an air-source heat pump, however the total bill is expected to be between pound, and pound,. “At a time when households are feeling the pressures of rising costs, it would be unrealistic for the Northern Ireland Government to expect a similar approach to incentivise households to decarbonise. “Heat pumps and retrofitting will be the right choice for many living in a thermally efficient or recently built house, but for those facing financial dficulties and living in an older, colder home, there must be options considered that won’t leave them behind on the road to net zero. “Heating oil is currently used in over , homes in Northern Ireland. A recent analysis by the AECOM engineering company showed that biofuels in home heating could achieve similar emission reductions to retrofitting, but at a much lower cost. The current biofuel being touted as the replacement for kerosene is Hydrotreated Vegetable Oilthat offers an immediate c.% reduction in carbon emissions. “Our message to local Government would be to examine every option available, and to keep low carbon options and no regret pathways on the new Assemblys agenda when considering the heating consultation later this year. A one size fits all approach must be avoided.” For more information, visit https:www.oftec.org   addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fffcedabfeafd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fddaedca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
