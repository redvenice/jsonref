Armed with that and the man’s family crest, Van Suchtelen went to the Cologne City Museum, where she found that the man’s coat of arms had belonged to Jakob Omphalius, a respected lawyer who become chancellor of his city in 1545.The city’s well-preserved civil records further revealed that Jakob had been married to Elisabeth Bellinghausen on 8 February 1539.But then the trail went cold. “At the auction they were separated, maybe to make more money - in the art trade you never know,” said Van Suchtelen. “The man was sold to an English dealer, Ralph Brocklebank, and the other portrait ended up in the collection of Cornelis Hoogendijk, who left it to Rijksmseum in 1912. So we had everything apart from Omphalius’s painting. I had to keep my eye open.”Records showed that the man’s painting had last been auctioned in 1955 but nothing had been seen of the piece since. It was not until May 2019 that Jakob reappeared as a “portrait of an unknown man” at a small auction house in Paris.The art collector Galerie De Jonckheere had bought the painting without knowing the identity of the person it featured. But when he put the painting on display in Geneva it was spotted by an art curator at a German museum as the portrait the Mauritshuis had been seeking.With the help of the Rembrandt Association, the Dutch lottery and a private donor, Omphalius’s portrait was purchased this year for €250,000 (£225,000). “And when you see them next to each other you see how well they go together – all the details go together very nicely,” said Van Suchtelen.Jakob is known to have studied in Utrecht, Paris and Toulouse before returning to Cologne to marry Elisabeth at the age of 39. She is believed to have been aged about 21 at the time of the portrait by Bruyn the Elder, a German master whose works appear in the National Gallery in London and the Louvre in Paris.The couple had 13 children, six of whom survived childhood. After Jakob’s death in 1567, at the age of 67, Elisabeth remarried and had a 14th child.“We had an obligation to reunite them,” Van Suchtelen said of her search. “For me it makes sense. I’m glad we had the patience for its reappearance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/292a6c0ccf35af1b1f63d26a6c61267d2e6606db/0_426_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80656b4559db5520c1e03ec5672974d0","title":"tate britain announces recipients of 10000 turner bursaries","story":"Cash awards given to 10 artists who would have been in the running for cancelled 2020 prizeA “fantastic and exciting” list of ten artists who would all have been in the running for this year’s Turner prize have been named as the recipients of £10,000 bursaries.Tate Britain on Thursday announced the names of artists who will receive no-strings-attached cash awards in place of this year’s abandoned competition.Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain, who chaired the jury choosing the artists, said the list reflected “the exceptional talent found in contemporary British art”.It features artists whose practice includes ceramics, photography, film, performance, sculpture, poetry and personal history. Most defy easy categorisation and are tackling issues that include marginality, identity, death and robotics.Farquharson agreed they were not artists who dealt in trivialities. “I’m sure one can give examples of humour and visual pleasure in there but yes, they are reflecting on very serious issues,” he said.The Turner prize is one of the world’s best-known contemporary arts prizes and annually picks up on trends and themes occupying the minds of artists working in Britain.“Obviously every artist and every practice is particular but I do think the idea of care came up a lot,” said Farquharson. “Care for oneself, care for a community one identifies with … sometimes in the face of hostility, or threat, or vulnerability.“I think that theme of care, for each other, for oneself, in all kinds of different ways does resonate strongly with the current moment.”The ten artists were chosen by this year’s Turner prize jury, who had already done most of the legwork in seeking out candidates for the cancelled 2020 prize.The discussions were familiar but the task was much simpler, said Farquharson. “Usually that extra step of getting down from 10 to four is quite time-consuming and the most painful because you are dealing with artists whose work the jury feels the strongest allegiance to.”Among those to get bursaries are the Israeli artist Oreet Ashery, chosen for a piece at the Wellcome Collection that explored the lived experience of care and chronic illness.Liz Johnson Artur, a Ghanaian-Russian artist who for 30 years has been photographing the lives of people from the African diaspora, was praised for her show at the South London Gallery, which aimed to capture the richness and complexity of black British life.The other artists to get the bursaries were:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5da9191922b96932b8937be9b56ebc774e39602/0_315_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff01a5a066f55cce5adfdb5b589e6f0e","title":"daily life is deeply magical images from openwalls arles 2020 in pictures","story":"Supernatural grandmothers and a family of 13 living on a boat were among the subjects that caught the eye of the prestigious photography award’s judges"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f46a255ee4555d660c787f247eba1c32b6dac095/0_0_4837_2904/master/4837.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=7efcf63f252f165a4fe917e2658d9e1a","title":"britain hong kong from china beijing freedom uk","story":"To think we can sway authoritarian Beijing is fantasy. Instead we must make those who want freedom welcome in the UKThe sight of young people anywhere being brutally stripped of their freedom is depressing. When that freedom was a legacy, however brief, from the British crown, it is more so. The ban on dissent now imposed by China on Hong Kong smashes the spirit and letter of the Sino-British treaty of 1984. It shows China for what it is, an unprincipled dictatorship.When I reported in 1997 on the Hong Kong celebrations bidding farewell to British rule, there was one question on all lips. It was: how long would Beijing’s 50-year pledge of “one nation, two systems” survive? The guesses were five years, perhaps 10. China would surely milk the cash cow for all it was worth, but any sign of trouble and Beijing would instantly wipe this “imperialist pimple” off the map. No one dreamed China’s patience would last 23 years.So it has proved. The ruthlessness of Beijing’s repression has surprised even hardened China-watchers. The former governor, Lord Patten, calls it Orwellian in its reach, not least in criminalising China’s critics everywhere abroad. A certain tolerance might have better served Beijing’s image. But every visitor to China knows that what matters to Beijing is how something looks in Beijing, not abroad. Authoritarianism validates its own rules.The bravery of young Hongkongers in defying the new measures has been impressive. Their defence of the enclave’s even partial liberties is witness to a rarely cited legacy of British empire, the embedding of democratic values in indigenous politics. Back in the benign 1990s, when communist autocracy seemed in retreat, the idea of former western colonies serving as advance bases of global democracy seemed just plausible. Britain and America even fought wars to that end in Afghanistan and Iraq.This ambition was fanciful. Hong Kong is part of China, and its attempted rebirth in 1997 as a liberal cuckoo in Beijing’s communist nest was absurd. Even the boldest dissident, the young Joshua Wong, gloomily admitted in his recent book Unfree Speech that he expected it eventually to become just another mainland Chinese city. The only question was when, and how.Britain is now in a dither over how to react. We can almost hear Beijing’s apparatchiks laugh as London erupts in impotent fury. Perhaps Boris Johnson would care to refight the opium wars. Perhaps he wants to discuss the Yangtze incident. The regime of Xi Jinping is currently the most disciplined and powerful force on Earth. The idea of it losing a minute’s sleep over virtue signalling on the far side of the globe is ridiculous. Yes, Xi tolerated the antics of Wong and his colleagues for a while. But it was certain that if they went too far, they would be silenced. Hong Kong’s soberer heads were right: the radicals should have lived with such freedoms as they were allowed. Now they have none.The dull echo of British empire, shared with Washington, is a craving to tell the rest of the world how to order its affairs. The walls of the Foreign Office are lined with images of four continents grovelling at the feet of Britannia. They seep into the psyche of British foreign ministers, year after year. This week, politicians of all parties have been dusting off the rusty weapons of yore. Johnson wants to send his unusable aircraft carrier to the South China Sea. There is talk of UN resolutions, trade embargos, “targeted sanctions” and ostracism. The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith wants to “show China that it can’t get away with tearing up international treaties and abusing human rights”.It can, and it will. The reality is that modern China can do what it likes, and there is nothing Duncan Smith or anyone in Britain – or Europe – can do about it. Meanwhile, as Britain buys missiles and planes, Beijing surges into the 21st century armed with the weapons of cyberwar and intellectual theft. It hacks systems, throws switches, corrupts elections and moves vast sums of money round the world at will. It is out of our league.The question of how to handle modern China clearly deserves the most careful attention. The veteran China-watcher Henry Kissinger has long contrasted the certainty of its internal command with the uncertainty, indeed immaturity, of its global outreach. The most pressing concern of its rulers is that its neighbours within the Pacific basin should not threaten its political stability. Hence the eye it keeps on Hong Kong, and over the horizon on South Korea and Taiwan. Relations between China and these countries are clearly unstable. But the idea that the west has any role in such potential conflicts, let alone a responsibility to police them, is madness.The way for the west to promote global democracy remains, as always, by example. Just now, in states on both sides of the Atlantic, democracy badly needs a spring clean. As for China, Britain’s strongest suit is its soft power, in particular the popularity of its schools and colleges to the Chinese middle class. There are more than 100,000 Chinese students in Britain, many of dubious loyalty to their own regime and therefore now at risk. They need encouraging and protecting from the new laws.One other debt of empire remains to be paid to Hong Kong, and Johnson was right this week to pay it. When Britain withdrew from the colony in 1997, it offered many of its people an overseas British passport, with the possible right of UK residency. Whatever treachery China may have perpetrated, Britain should keep its side of the bargain. We could never give Hong Kong democracy. We can at least give it refuge from democracy’s foes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f89b81fe0d1f183916989d76523ca7d20734755/0_18_3363_2019/master/3363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33860b114325f26d519525df67eaed5a","title":"labours real struggle left v right young and minority voters keir starmer","story":"Keir Starmer now has control of his party. But he risks alienating the very people Labour needs to embraceAs far as Labour is concerned, Keir Starmer is now master of all he surveys. A landslide victory among the party’s membership was accompanied by his appointment of the national executive committee’s general secretary, and with it control of the party machine. In the past two weeks, his removal of Rebecca Long-Bailey from the shadow cabinet and changes to NEC voting mechanisms have cemented the Starmer ascendancy. Commentators who spent years howling about Corbynite authoritarianism demand more: the left must not just be thrashed but humiliated in the process. A year ago, the headline above one Times commentator’s column was “Jeremy Corbyn’s intolerance makes him unfit to lead”. Two weeks ago it was “Keir Starmer should finish the purge of Corbynism”.As Starmer eyes the best ratings of an opposition leader since the mid-1990s and the party begins to shrink the polling gap, his team can seemingly afford to shrug off their internal opponents. If criticisms from within are framed as the left versus the leadership, that suits the latter’s outriders, who can dismiss them as the petulant howls of discredited losers.But in an age of political unpredictability and fluidity, complacency would be unwise: just ask Boris Johnson who, three months ago, headed the most popular government in a decade, with a net approval of +26 (it is now –9). Starmer’s emerging Achilles heel is not his demoralised internal leftwing opponents: it is younger people and minorities.When Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour deprived the Tories of a majority in 2017, the party won the highest support among the under-40s in any election, including Tony Blair’s landslide. It also repelled more pensioners than ever, and given they constitute a quarter of the electorate and are motivated to vote, Labour did not win that election. Even in the 2019 rout, Labour’s lead among the under-25s actually increased. While Corbyn had dire approval ratings in the overall population at the last election, he enjoyed net support among ethnic minority voters. There are important exceptions, of course – Jews worried about antisemitism and some British Indian voters affronted by Labour’s support for Kashmiri self-determination – but Corbyn’s long involvement with anti-racism struggles and close alliance with figures such as Diane Abbott led many minorities to conclude he was a natural ally.Defunding the police was never going to be part of Starmer’s policy package, but during a global uprising against systemic racism he could have taken a more constructive approach. He could have said he was not a spokesman for Black Lives Matter, that while he supported the police, reform was needed in a country in which most black people believe the police are institutionally racist. He could have pointed to the report put together by his own shadow justice secretary, David Lammy. He could also have championed investment in youth, social and mental health services, rather than relying on the justice system to deal with society’s ills.Younger people flocked to Corbyn’s Labour in unprecedented numbers for two reasons: first, their economic and social insecurity, from the housing crisis to student debt to low-paid work second, they felt their progressive social values were under assault. They have no ingrained loyalty or sentimentality towards the party. Otherwise politically disengaged young people post in support of Black Lives Matter. If the suited former director of public prosecutions wants to pick a fight with the Black Lives Matter movement young people will judge him harshly for it.That nearly two-thirds of black and minority ethnic voters have seen Labour as their champion is unsurprising: as well as an inherently racist justice system, nearly half of black African Caribbean households languish below the poverty line, andblack, Asian and minority ethnic workers are far more likely to have insecure work and to live in overcrowded homes. These are injustices that cannot be fixed with tinkering or with half-measures: only transformative policies can be considered genuine remedies.For those who want the party to remain committed to radical change, the battle lines should not be drawn as “left versus right”, but judged on whether Labour is abandoning the under-40s and minorities. True, Labour is emphatic it retains the pledge, for instance, to scrap tuition fees, although it refuses to commit to any manifesto policies. But when none of the party’s recent economic statements mentions the climate emergency, that should be judged as betraying younger people who will suffer the worst consequences of this existential crisis. When Starmer sits on the fence on trans rights, the leadership should be taught a lesson: that for younger people, LGBTQ rights are an article of faith. From housing to jobs to education to public services, a test must be applied: does the radicalism of Labour’s policies meet the scale of injustice facing younger and minority Britons.For those within the party, from Momentum to the soft left Open Labour, a coalition should be built to hold the leadership to the policy commitments Starmer made in his election: that is, after all, his mandate. But more importantly, extra-parliamentary movements such as Black Lives Matter can communicate a message that is impossible to ignore: the support of the under-40s and minorities is not unconditional, it has to be actively sought, and if they feel the party has abandoned them, they will respond accordingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7e35ec6f94a896a0ee762af7e1e7427d276a050/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f6d37fa0789212dd7d7106f03fa919b","title":"security global pandemic vaccines treatments coronavirus","story":"Until every country is protected, we are all at risk. Only effective vaccines and treatments will allow us to eradicate coronavirus• Dr Jeremy Farrar is director of the Wellcome TrustSix months on from the first cases of Covid-19 emerging in Wuhan, many of us in Britain will be feeling a mixture of relief and trepidation as England’s lockdown eases. The loosening of restrictions, alongside warmer weather, has brought hope. The UK government is understandably anxious to get society and the economy back on track. This is what we all want, and it’s what scientists are striving to ensure.Since the virus began to ripple across the world, scientists have worked at incredible speed to deepen our understanding of Covid-19. There have been advances in record time more than 200 vaccine candidates are already in development, and a treatment identified, dexamethasone, that we now know saves lives. We’ve achieved in months what would normally take decades.But these huge leaps shouldn’t lull us into a false sense of security. Though national lockdowns have saved many lives, the virus hasn’t gone away. The road to eliminating Covid-19 still contains many unknowns. We don’t yet know how the virus will evolve, how immunity is generated or how long it lasts. We don’t have a vaccine to stop people getting sick, or a range of different treatments to help them avoid the need for hospitalisation, or to prevent their symptoms from worsening if they’re already hospitalised.Globally, the pandemic is accelerating and spreading into new areas of the US, central and south America, south Asia and Africa. More than 10 million cases and 500,000 deaths, both undoubtedly underestimates, are grim milestones a long way from any final tolls.Countries that have managed to reduce coronavirus cases are still at risk of rebounds and further waves. In places such as Beijing, North Rhine-Westphalia and Leicester there have been worrying increases in the number of new cases. The US is still witnessing a daily increase in infections. The situation in the UK and US, two countries that have suffered a large number of cases during the pandemic, balances on a knife edge.Across Europe, and in the UK in particular, governments must take the time to step back and learn from the experiences of the past six months to avoid further crises and cope with a potential second wave. We can assume this second wave will arrive in the winter.Having a robust system of testing, tracing and isolating delivered across communities, schools, hospitals and care homes will be vital to keeping this virus under control. Data about the spread of the virus must be shared rapidly with relevant public health authorities and communicated to local authorities. Collecting data is not enough. This data must be used to inform a rapid, pre-planned response. And this response needs to be trusted, led by local practitioners and targeted at specific clusters and hotspots to prevent future transmission.But these aren’t long-term solutions. Securing effective vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 and strengthening public health are the only ways to bring this pandemic to an end. Until every country is protected, we all remain at risk. We will need billions of doses of vaccines and treatments. Nothing on this scale has ever been attempted before, and current manufacturing and distribution capacity is nowhere near enough to deliver such a feat.I’ve been impressed over the past few months by the support that governments, industry bodies and philanthropists have shown for collaboration. It’s what has made the remarkable scientific progress that we’ve seen possible. Attempts by national governments to buy up stocks of diagnostic treatments and vaccines in order to protect their own citizens aren’t just wrong on moral and ethical grounds. They are also not smart public health. This disease pays no attention to national borders.Securing equitable access to vaccines, treatments and tests for all is not altruism. It’s in every country’s best interest to work together to prevent second waves and avoid more deaths and economic hardship. Leaving countries behind would jeopardise the entire endeavour – with consequences felt among high and low-income countries alike.In the past six months we have learned a huge amount about Covid-19. We are getting better at treating this disease, and mortality rates have come down, but there is no avoiding the enormity of the task ahead of us. The longer we wait, the worse the damage will be. We are still at the start of this pandemic and there is only one exit strategy – interventions that change the fundamentals of infection, transmission and illness. We must learn from the first six months of the pandemic, redouble our efforts and continue to act together.• Dr Jeremy Farrar is director of the Wellcome Trust"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd8d529e8d25fff9510d9ffd11d4b6f965164520/168_153_3264_1960/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3eb83d0b37d056e4317d29253dfeb2","title":"teachers and parents how do you feel about schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from parents and teachers about the government’s announcement that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full at the start of the next academic yearThe government have today announced that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full in September.Current limitations on the number of students that can be in school at once will be lifted, but schools will be expected to keep children in ‘bubbles’ according to their class or year group.

On 8 November, 90 hours of untreated sewage discharged from the overflow pipe. revealed this week that more than 1.5m hours of untreated sewage was discharged into English rivers last year via CSOs. The data, obtained under environmental information requests, gives the most comprehensive picture of the scale of sewage discharges the Environment Agency allows water companies to carry out.Theo Thomas, the founder of London Waterkeeper, said: “The Olympic Park is the biggest urban park built in a generation. It was meant to be a legacy project but 1,000 hours of sewage was spilled last year into the wetlands.“This is a public park and what is happening is unacceptable in 2020. It shows a callous disregard for public spaces and our environment.”Thomas is campaigning with Surfers Against Sewage for water companies to stop releasing untreated sewage into rivers.Hugo Tagholm of Surfers Against Sewage said: “The health of our rivers is inextricably linked to the health of our ocean. Polluted rivers will always lead to a polluted ocean. We need connected and thriving aquatic ecosystems, free from sewage and pollution.”Feargal Sharkey, the Undertones lead singer and a keen fly fisherman, said the Environment Agency was complicit in allowing the pollution of rivers through storm overflows.“They know perfectly well what is going on. They have known about it for decades and refused to properly deal with the situation,” he said.When the sewer system is operating normally, sewage leaves homes and businesses and is treated at a treatment works. Only when it has been treated is wastewater released to the environment, either out to sea through long outfalls or coastal discharges, or into rivers.The vast majority of England’s sewer network is a combined system, which dates back to Victorian engineering, and is designed to collect the contents of people’s toilets and surface rainwater then transfer them together to treatment plants.After extreme rainfall, the treatment works cannot cope with the volume of water and untreated sewage. Human excrement, condoms, sanitary towels and toilet paper are released untreated into rivers through combined sewer overflow pipes – just as it was in 19th-century London.These pipes are supposed to be a safety valve to release pressure in the system and used only when an exceptionally large amount of water enters the system.The release of untreated sewage and waste water is permitted in extraordinary circumstances – such as extreme rainfall – to relieve pressure in the system. But critics say the ’s data shows how routine sewage dumping in inland waters is.A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: “The sewage system is designed to overflow to relieve pressure on the system – discharges from CSOs are not a sign that the system is faulty or being misused.“However, when companies do damage the environment, whether it is through polluting our waters or breaching permit conditions, we will take enforcement action against them including civil sanctions.”Thames Water said: “We have invested heavily in monitoring equipment to understand how frequently spills are made to the environment, and to better target investment in the best solutions.“Any discharge is undesirable but they only happen when there is literally no alternative and to prevent flooding to homes. It is the way the system is designed to operate.”• Statements from the water companies can be read in full here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9555beb71c55c8ab1ea8601a18d82db154225e7e/0_141_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53f2560f710997209c27be64f0d3373b","title":"uk gives go ahead to giant windfarm project off norfolk coast vanguard","story":"1.8GW Vanguard project gets greenlight, with approval on 2.4GW Hornsea 3 expected in autumn The construction of two giant offshore windfarms is poised to go ahead off the Norfolk coast in what the renewable energy industry claims could provide a “huge boost” to the UK economy.The business secretary, Alok Sharma, gave the green light on Wednesday evening to the Norfolk Vanguard project and said he was “minded to approve” the Hornsea 3 proposal later this year.The 1.8GW Norfolk Vanguard windfarm will be more than 40 miles off the Bacton coast by the Swedish energy group Vattenfall. The 2.4GW Hornsea 3 windfarm, which is being proposed by the Danish company Orsted, would extend the Hornsea 1 and 2 projects further into the North Sea.Together the two new projects would generate enough clean electricity to power almost 4m UK homes, as well as providing a boost to the economy, according to Renewable UK.“Investments in major clean energy projects like these are great examples of how we can get the economy moving again,” said Hugh McNeal, the chief executive of the industry body.“These projects will help us to maintain our global lead in offshore wind, as well as building up our UK supply chain. “Large scale offshore wind power is good for our environment and our economy, by tackling climate change will boosting productivity and creating thousands of jobs in the process.”The government faces growing calls to invest in the UK’s green industries to help bolster the economy following the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Gunnar Groebler, the head of Vattenfall’s wind power business, said the decision to approve the Vanguard project justified “the confidence that we have in the offshore wind sector in Britain”.“Today’s news sends a strong signal that the UK is serious about its climate ambitions and is open for business to power a green economic recovery,” he said.The greenlight from Sharma comes weeks after the government pushed back a decision deadline for another offshore Vattenfall windfarm, the 1.8GW Norfolk Boreas project, by up to five months.At the time the company described the move as regrettable” and said it could “send the wrong signal” to the renewables industry.The government expects to make a decision on the Boreas project before the end of October, and on the Hornsea 3 project by the end of September subject to further information, which is required from Orsted.An Orsted spokesman said that although the company was disappointed by the delay, it was confident that it would be able to provide the necessary evidence within the government’s timeframe.“Hornsea 3 is a major infrastructure project which responds directly to the urgent need for low-carbon generation at scale in the UK and can contribute to a green economic recovery,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c8254cc51be58bc0749aba8741dc4e63e40ec09/752_1513_6136_3680/master/6136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4be97cecaf4a169679865e5347e4798","title":"how to cook crab linguine recipe felicity cloake","story":"Revive memories of Italian seaside cafes with this step-by-step guide to making classic crab linguineFew things scream summer holiday to me more than a big bowl of briny, seafood-studded pasta, even if it’s going to be eaten in front of the TV rather than some pretty Italian harbour. Happily, seafood is one of the things we do rather well in this country, and this dish is the perfect end for a fat, brown, British crab. Sunshine optional.\u0026nbsp2 brown crabs, or 200g brown crabmeat and 200g white crabmeat 400g linguine2 garlic cloves1 red chilli1 tbsp olive oil1 tsp fennel seeds, crushed1 lemon1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, roughly choppedExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishStart with the crab. You may have bought it ready picked, but if not, you’ll need to get at the meat first. There are many online videos and tutorials showing this process in detail, but start by snapping off the claws close to the body, then remove the bottom of the shell by inserting the tip of a knife into the mouth (just below the eyes) and twisting gently.Prise off the back of the shell and locate and remove the hard spiny bits around the eyes and mouth, and the yellowish stomach sac attached to them, plus any bits of papery membrane and the dead man’s fingers, the greyish fronds around the edge of the shell. (Despite the name, they’re not poisonous, but they’re not very tasty, either.)Scoop the brown meat into one bowl and the white into another – a\u0026nbspsharp tap with a hammer, rolling pin or even a wooden spoon will help you to get into the stuff in the claws. Don’t miss the white meat in the leg sockets, either the handle of a teaspoon is a useful tool here. Keep any large pieces of claw meat separate.\u0026nbspBring a large pan of generously salted water to a boil and cook the pasta to your taste – this should take around eight to 10 minutes, unless you like it very al dente or very soft. Linguine is my preference here, but spaghetti, or any other long pasta, would also be fine (in fact, let’s be honest, almost any shape would be delicious).\u0026nbspWhile the pasta is cooking, peel and finely chop the garlic, and deseed and finely chop the chilli. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat, then fry the garlic, chilli and fennel seeds for a couple of minutes until soft, but not coloured remember that garlic, in particular, burns easily.Take the frying pan off the heat, grate in the zest of half the lemon, then squeeze in the juice of the whole thing (do this through your other hand, to catch any errant pips alternatively, squeeze it into a cup and pour it into the pan through a sieve). Now stir in all the brown crab meat until well combined.\u0026nbspScoop a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water out of the pan and set aside, then drain the pasta. Add the drained pasta to the frying pan, season and toss it around to coat the strands with the sauce add a little of the reserved cooking water, if you think it needs loosening.\u0026nbspRoughly chop the parsley, set a little aside to garnish and add the rest to the pan along with the 200g white crab meat (if you don’t have any large claw pieces, keep a little bit back, to finish). Toss again, ide between bowls and drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil. Finish with the remaining parsley and the claw (or reserved white) meat, and serve at once.If you’d like to add vegetables, the River Cafe puts shaved fresh fennel into its crab pasta, while River Cottage goes for fresh tomatoes (I reckon a handful of the cherry variety, added to the pan with the garlic and chilli, so they just burst in the heat, would be best). Tinned crab doesn’t seem to work well here, sadly – or at least not the brands I’ve tried.⁃  aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

You can pick one up for as little as three quid, and it does olives as well.If you haven’t got one of these and you’re faced with a recipe asking you to stone 500g of cherries, the most sensible course is to sit down, eat all the cherries and spit the stones out the window. This is, of course, the ultimate test of any cherry recipe: does it represent any sort of improvement on just eating cherries? If it’s close, a stoner may tip the balance.You can buy gadgets that stone six cherries at once, or machines that will stone a whole hopper full but, for a seasonal task like this, a little effort – a little ritual, even – is probably a good thing. It ought to take you a bit of time. There are other satisfactory methods, like this one using a bottle and a chopstick, but you may have to find the right bottleneck for your particular size of cherry. You can also manage the operation – messily – with a paperclip, should you find yourself cooking in an office setting.Nigel Slater’s recipes for cherry pie and cherry polenta cake are both good places to start – they’re straightforward and don’t ask too much of you. One of the difficulties of cherry season is that it arrives just at the point when the weather makes baking seem like a terrible idea. Chill your pastry dough that little bit longer, and find some shade to sit in while you wait.Cherry sorbet sounds an altogether cooler dessert, and Tamal Ray’s recipe requires only about 20 minutes over a hot stove. Better still, it has just three ingredients: cherries, sugar and white wine. Incidentally, if you’re going to end up with a puree, you don’t need to make a fuss about stoning the cherries. Just whack each one with the flat of a knife like you would a clove of garlic the stone will come away easily. Or, as Ray points out, you can cook the cherries whole and remove the stones once they’re soft.Clafoutis is a French dessert – whole cherries (stones left in, traditionally) baked in a batter until just set. Felicity Cloake’s perfect version contains almond essence and kirsch – a morello cherry liqueur which she describes as “ridiculously expensive”. Feel free to leave it out, along with the stones.Alternatively, you could invest in some kirsch for the season, since it is also called for in Liam Charles’s wholly nontraditional cherry bakewell custard tart. There is a lot going on in the name of this dish, but it is not unrelated to the clafoutis: cherries, almond essence and kirsch, baked in custard.This cherry galette also marries cherries and almonds – in this case via frangipane, the almond, flour, butter, sugar and egg paste that occupies a mysterious border realm somewhere between crust and filling. “Galette”, roughly translated, means “don’t worry – it’s supposed to look like that.” White spelt flour is recommended for the pastry, but it’s not a dealbreaker.Rachel Roddy’s cherry and ricotta tart has a latticed crust top with ricotta puffing out from underneath and a cherry filling below that. In Italy the cherries would be sour, but you can make this work with whatever sort you’ve got. The trick is to avoid overcooking the cherries – remove them with a slotted spoon before they turn mushy, reduce the remaining liquid to a syrup, and then put the cherries back in.Cherries and chocolate are another classic combination, most notably in black forest gateau, which is normally made with tinned black cherries, sometimes with the perverse addition of fresh cherries – stalks on – as a decoration. Dan Lepard uses fresh cherries to make the filling first. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall preserves the basic pairing in his cherry chocolate tart, which calls for yet more kirsch. It also requires you to be forward thinking enough to leave the cherries to infuse overnight.For sheer laid-back ease, I love the idea of a “broken cake”: basically any stale cake ripped up and tossed with cherry syrup, fresh fruit, cream or ricotta and other things. It’s hardly even a recipe, and it makes Eton mess look positively ordered.Fresh cherries may just be for summer, but they’re not just for pudding. They can make an appearance in salads, alongside rocket or goat’s cheese or both, with cucumber, basil and quinoa, or roasted, with buttermilk dressing and lettuce.This pickled-cherries recipe (Nigel Slater again – going through his back catalogue, you get the impression he really likes cherries) can be served over mackerel or gammon. And duck with cherry sauce is most definitely a thing. A seasonal glut and a greedy nature will invariably leave you with some less than perfect, slightly post-ripe fruit and the distinct feeling that you never want to look at another cherry again. This will not last, but in the meantime you can make enough jam to see you through the dark, cheerless, cherryless months. This is an easy method, but the jam sugar is not optional: cherries are low in pectin, so they won’t set by themselves. In contrast, this cherry and chia seed jam, from reader Rheanna Lucy Akua Griffin, has no sugar in it: just a little agave nectar or honey.Finally, when you have exhausted all other avenues, make this cherry vodka – absolutely no stoning required. Slit 400g of cherries, heat them with water and sugar until dissolved, cool, add a bottle of vodka, seal the mixture up and leave it for at least four weeks. It’s the poor man’s kirsch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52d6f67212ef6ef167c33b462f66c0bdce706ef9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f48e1d35038358c06e96c4d157b1908a","title":"the strange tale of the england schoolboys football team","story":"Wembley will not be hosting any fans this summer. For much of the 20th century, it was packed full for Under-15s gamesBy Gavin Willacy for Playing in the ShadowsAaron Martin’s return to Wembley on Monday did not go as well as his debut under the arch. This week, Martin was at the heart of Exeter City’s back three as they were torn apart by Northampton Town, humbled 4-0 in the League Two play-off final. Twelve years ago, he was man of the match at Wembley, putting in a commanding display for England Schoolboys in a 2-0 win over Scotland.Back then, Martin was playing his club football for Eastleigh in Conference South, the sixth tier of English football. He was joined on the Wembley turf that day by players from Winsford United, Oadby Town and Thurrock. So how did this bunch of teenage students end up playing for their country at the national stadium? It’s a strange tale.From 1950, when Johnny Haynes grabbed a hat-trick in an 8-2 thrashing of Scotland in front of 53,000, until 2009, the English Schools Football Association organised international matches at Wembley for their England Schoolboys team. The annual game provided a chance to sample a major match atmosphere, to cheer the future stars of the game, albeit in disconcertingly high voices.The tradition grew rapidly. In 1959, a crowd of 95,000 packed into Wembley to see England beat West Germany, an attendance that was matched two years later when Scotland were dismantled 8-1. Some of the finest 14- and 15-year-olds in the country pulled on the England shirt, from Bobby Charlton and Terry Venables through to Ryan Giggs (then Wilson – who attended a school in Salford) and Michael Owen.Their two Wembley fixtures – sponsored by various multinational fizzy drinks and crisp manufacturers – pretty much funded the ESFA’s annual activities. More than 50,000 spectators saw England’s goalless draw with Brazil in 1998, including guest of honour Haynes, the last Under-15s international at Wembley.As the Twin Towers prepared to be flattened, Howard Wilkinson drove a revolution of youth football, insisting that the FA seize control of the Under-15 team from the football-loving teachers of ESFA. Those PE teachers who coached England Schoolboys on a voluntary basis included John Owens, who developed Steven Gerrard in Liverpool’s academy, Manchester United’s youth guru Dave Bushell, and the man primarily responsible for Charlton producing a clutch of current Premier League stars, Steve Avory. These coaches were not Brian Glover characters from Kes.After losing their flagship, revenue-generating team, the ESFA had little alternative but to throw their Under-18 team – which had been ticking over quietly since the 1960s – on to the Wembley stage instead. These England Schoolboys were not the best young players in the country. Far from it. They were just some of the better sixth-formers who had stayed on in education, rather than joining the 1,700 apprentices at Premier League or EFL clubs. Selected via county teams and a series of trials, they were not even all the best college players in the country.Up against the best young professionals from overseas, the England Schoolboys Under-18 team understandably found it tough. It was no surprise when they lost the first Under-18 schools international at Wembley, in 1999, 2-1 to Holland. Gary Taylor-Fletcher, then with Northwich Victoria, was the only member of that team that went on to have a successful professional career, including a season in the Premier League with Blackpool. One of his old teammates is now a trauma surgeon another is a headmaster. Brains often outweighed verve in these England teams.The few England Schoolboys players who did turn professional each year tended to have prolonged careers, often in low-profile leadership roles. Goalkeeper Ben Williams, the only notable graduate of the team beaten by Hungary at Wembley in 2000, played for 11 clubs after leaving Manchester United.There are late developers who benefit from avoiding the physical and mental grind of a decade in the academy system. Some were released by big clubs in their mid-teens and returned determined to make the most of their second chance. Others turned down apprenticeship offers to do A-levels in sixth form. Occasionally, talent just gets missed and the schoolboys team can bear fruit for EFL scouts.The back three in that 2008 team sum up the bizarre nature of England Schoolboys teams. Aaron Martin signed for Southampton soon after impressing at Wembley. To his left was Jack Thorley, who never played a minute in professional football but is now a doctor of zoology at Cambridge University. To the right was a tall, gangly lad from Maidstone United who, after being released by Millwall, had been driven to a trial at Gillingham by the Lions’ head scout because he felt so sorry for him. A riot of nerves on the biggest stage of his life, his clumsy display provided few clues that Christopher Smalling would go on to play more than 200 games for Manchester United and 31 for the full England team.Smalling had done enough before Wembley to draw the attention of Fulham, but his career trajectory is unique for an 18-year-old on the England Schoolboys team. Playing hundreds of games in the Football League is more typical.After playing in midfield for England Schools in 1997, Wade Elliott went to Goldsmiths art school. Twelve years later he scored the goal at Wembley that took Burnley to the Premier League, one of his 706 professional appearances. Of the 2004 side, three have had 15 year playing careers: Chris Lines – who was back at Wembley on Monday night on the bench for Northampton Town in the play-offs – has clocked up nearly 500 games Russell Martin is in his first managerial role with MK Dons, having played for Norwich in the Premier League and John Mousinho captains Oxford in the League One play-offs this week. Wycombe midfielder David Wheeler – capped by the Schoolboys team in 2009 while he was with Lewes – could make another Wembley appearance later this month, possibly against Mousinho, in the final.Chris Whelpdale – from the class of 2005 - has played 300 games in the Football League John Brayford (2006) went from Burton College to the Premier League with Cardiff City Ben Tozer (2007) signed for Newcastle and captained Cheltenham in the League Two play-offs last week.Smalling is not the only England Schoolboys Under-18 international who went on to win a league title. David Wetherall did it with Leeds in 1992 (although he missed the open-top bus parade to revise for exams) and Mark Atkins did it with Blackburn in 1995. But they are outliers.Wembley hosted its last England Schoolboys international in June 2009. Alexandre Lacazette missed out on a Wembley debut, replaced in the France Under-18 team by Lyon striker Yannis Tafer, who promptly scored a hat-trick as Ligue 1’s best teenage talent – including Anthony Martial’s brother Johan and Arsenal duo Francis Coquelin and Gilles Sunu – beat England 4-2.The honour of scoring England Schoolboys’ last ever goal at Wembley lies with James Norwood – then with Eastbourne, now at Ipswich. The cost of renting the new stadium was simply too much for the ESFA as crowds sank to just 9,000. Matches at Wembley had become more common and PE teachers had stopped giving up a Saturday to escort busloads of students to the annual fixture. Sponsors fell away and internationals under the arch became a serious loss-maker, not a golden payday. A splendidly unique and strange English football tradition was over.Follow Gavin Willacy and Playing in the Shadows on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2383b1362b925acf560e6eb61065b6100b545ae8/0_85_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abf31a17a5f869d4a87e01f1ee750eed","title":"matsepo ramakoae and lesothos lost chance to elect its first female leader","story":"After the resignation of Thomas Thabane the small south African nation could have addressed its huge political gender imbalance. What happened?Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom in southern Africa, has always been dwarfed in size and achievements by its neighbour South Africa.Many people around the world were not even aware of Lesotho’s existence until the beginning of this year when then prime minister Thomas Thabane and his third wife, Maesaiah Thabane, were accused of murdering Thabane’s estranged second wife, Lipolelo, in 2017.The ensuing murder case and the ousting of Thabane by his own All Basotho Convention (ABC) party, thrust Lesotho on to the international stage.While the episode showed Lesotho in a negative light, the resultant vacancy at the State House did give the tiny country an opportunity to get one over on its more illustrious neighbour by doing what South Africa failed to do in 2018 – appointing its first ever female prime minister.South Africa had the opportunity to install Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma after the resignation of her ex-husband, Jacob Zuma, but the ruling African National Congress (ANC) ended up narrowly choosing Cyril Ramaphosa.Its a similarity not lost on Matsepo Ramakoae, a battle-hardened veteran of the ABC’s and Lesotho’s treacherous political terrain, who stepped forward in May as candidate for the post of prime minister. But, like South Africa, Lesotho’s ruling politicians instead chose a man: former finance minister Moeketsi Majoro, who has just succeeded Thabane.Not that Majoro, a savvy former International Monetary Fund (IMF) staffer, is not well-qualified. But when a woman candidate with arguably better credentials steps forward, it would have gone a long way in making up for Lesotho’s failure to fulfil a decades-old pledge to ensure equal representation of women in positions of power by 2015.“I believe I have the qualities to be prime minister,” Ramakoae tells the .The 66-year-old politician is a founding member of the ABC. Thabane appointed her deputy finance minister in 2012, and she is savvy enough to appeal to the international community with her solid grasp of development issues.Unlike Majoro and most other ABC members, she refrained from taking sides in the factional fights that have now battered the party for more than a year. She would have been an ideal oil for these factional troubled waters.“I am of the view that despite whatever procedures of selection are followed, if everything is done in a broad daylight with observation of democratic systems of fair and equal opportunity of competition, I can become the next prime minister.“My party has the majority. I am a member of parliament for Matsieng, I have my own constituency and I can be elected. I have experience. I’ve been in the civil service for a long time. I have also been in parliament,” she says.But it was not to be for the former career civil servant and as even the stride forward that saw a female speaker, Ntlhoi Motsamai, elected was reversed with a male replacement in new speaker, Sephiri Motanyane, Lesotho is again looking at a gulf of gender underrepresentation.After the most recent general election in June 2017, only 27 of the 120 seats are held by women, a decline from 30 seats in 2015.The main ruling coalition partner, the ABC, fielded just seven female candidates in the June 2017 polls. Only three won and junior coalition partners fared even worse – the Basotho National Party (BNP), led by a former minister of gender, Thesele Maseribane, had 16 female candidates, none of whom won and the Reformed Congress of Lesotho, the only party led by a woman, Keketso Rantšo, won no seats at all.Marematlou Freedom Party, the only party to field an equal 30 female and 30 male candidates, had only won one victory: a man.It seems achieving equal representation in Lesotho remains a pipe dream, exacerbated by the fact that even when a woman steps forward, as Ramakoae did, she is passed over. But it has provoked anger.The former deputy speaker Teboho Lehloenya says the under-representation of women was a clear indication that Lesotho has to take urgent action.“Efforts to empower women and elevate them to positions of power and decision-making have been made, but the progress is painstakingly sluggish and as a result woman are still under represented in parliament,” Lehloenya says.“Among other factors that deter women from contesting for political power are the intimidation and violence they encounter in the race to elections. It is therefore imperative for policymakers to initiate efforts to eliminate these barriers and expedite process to increase female representation in positions of power and decision-making.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecc5d832eb4f4d08134a2beb2e098d371ac18415/0_117_5370_3222/master/5370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=127558e3b8fe317dff012970a2a5a84d","title":"every human year not equivalent to seven dog years scientists find","story":"Study of DNA changes in labradors suggests puppies age much faster than older dogsDogs do not simply age at seven times the rate of humans, scientists have found in a study that reveals young dogs might be “older” than previously thought.The findings suggest a one-year-old puppy is actually about 30 in “human years” – an age when humans, at least, might be expected to have stopped running riot with the toilet paper.Writing in the journal Cell Systems, researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine describe how they focused on epigenetic changes to DNA – modifications that don’t change the DNA sequence but can switch genes on or off.In particular the team compared the way the particular molecules, called methyl groups, accumulated in certain areas of the human genome over time with how they accumulated in similar areas in the dog genome.The results, which draw on genetic data from about a hundred labrador retrievers from puppies to elderly animals, reveal every human year is not equivalent to seven dog years.Instead the situation is more complex, with dogs showing far more rapid accumulation of methyl groups in their genome than us within their first year or so, suggesting they age at a much faster rate. However the rate of ageing in dogs, compared with humans, slows down as the years roll by.Indeed, the findings suggest a one-year-old dog would have a “human age” of about 30, while by the age of four they’d be about 54 in “human years” and by 14 years old they would be on a par with a human in their mid-70s.The relationship, the team say, is described by the formula: human age  16 ln(dog_age) + 31. In maths, ln refers to the natural logarithm of a number.The team say the work now needs to be repeated in other breeds of dog. But, they say, for young and old dogs, the relationship seems to reflect the ages at which humans and dogs experience particular milestones.“For instance, the epigenome translated seven weeks in dogs to nine months in humans, corresponding to the infant stage when deciduous teeth erupt in both puppies and babies,” the team wrote in a preprint of the study. “In seniors, the expected life of labrador retrievers, 12 years, correctly translated to the worldwide lifetime expectancy of humans, 70 years.However, they note that the links are more approximate when it comes to adolescent and mid-life milestones – although still more accurate than the previous idea that dogs consistently age at seven times the rate of humans.The team add that the study suggests human and dogs both accumulate methyl groups on some of the same genes as they age. These, the team note, are involved in a variety of functions linked to development, including the assembly of synapses – junctions between neurons.Prof Lucy Asher, an expert in canine puberty at Newcastle University who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.“If we think about ageing in terms of how old our cells are, this new paper is really useful in matching up human and dog years,” she said, adding such biological ageing is important for medical and veterinary health.But, Asher added, the match breaks down if ageing is considered in terms of behaviours, hormones or growth – meaning we shouldn’t be surprised at the escapades of young dogs.“Whilst a 30-year-old human might have cells of an analogous ‘age’ to a one-year-old dog, many dogs won’t be fully grown at this time and they will still have unsettled hormones and behaviour associated with puberty,” she said, noting that one-year-old dogs act more like human teenagers. “The development of dogs is not just a shortened version of the human development, which is why it’s difficult to find a clear match-up between a dog’s age and a human’s age.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb10c0f998e7d48942fa1603ebcf0dc07ce008c1/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aee839c9bf2ee7b47d77ef07359d5a2","title":"lockdown easing why the uk is better prepared for a second wave","story":"This Saturday, lockdown measures in England will ease further, with people able to get a pint in a pub, have a haircut and see another household indoors. ’s heath editor, Sarah Boseley, looks at whether another lifting of restrictions might result in a second wave, and if it does, why we are better prepared this time round From this Saturday, the government has said that in England, pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen, two households will be able to meet in any setting with physical distancing measures, and people can enjoy staycations with the reopening of accommodation sites. But with the loosening of restrictions comes fears of a second wave.

I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

Here, he looks back on the experience of shooting matches in empty grounds amid strict Covid-19 precautionsClick on each image for more informationThat bloody bird has been putting me off all game. High up in the stand above me at Carrow Road, a seagull is roosting and making a right old racket. It seems to be distracting the Norwich defence too, as Nathan Redmond strolls through and scores to put Southampton 3-0 up. There’s a brief cheer and a polite round of applause from a couple of Saints staff members in the stand before Redmond performs a Black Power salute. It’s all very surreal. Black Lives Matter meets Behind Closed Doors football. Welcome to the world of Project Restart, the Covid-19 version of the Premier League.For the last two weeks I have been lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to be let in to see the resumption of top-class football in England. When normally I could be one of between 20 to 50 photographers attending these matches, now it’s just a maximum of 10. Current rules state there must be no more than 300 people inside the ground at any one time.My first game back was the one that launched the resumption, at Aston Villa as they faced Sheffield United. All attendees at matches are required to have a temperature check before accreditation is given. In a building in the main car park I’m stood on a designated spot and look at a screen, like a high-tech speak-your-weight machine. This equipment deems me safe and my pass is handed over. Rumour has it that Manchester City have splashed out on an even flashier thermometerand a scanner operated by a real nurse. At the other grounds I’ve subsequently been to, the temperature check is performed with a little white plastic gun to the forehead. At Spurs, before their game v West Ham, it’s boiling hot. To make matters worse the man with the gun is waiting at the top of a flight of stairs and I’m carrying a ton of gear up there. My fingers are crossed as the gun points at my red, sweaty temple.Every ground is ided into three zones: green, amber and red. Roughly speaking, green is the immediate vicinity outside the stadium, amber inside the ground, red on the pitch and the tunnel area. Only players and club officials, those who are regularly tested, get into the red zone. I am amber. Before every game I’m sent a health declaration form to sign along with safety protocols to read. These vary enormously from club to club but the most substantial and well organised is definitely Liverpool’s, courtesy of their safety officer, Mr Stan Tickle.As I go into the first match at Villa, I look up at a big screen. “Face coverings must be worn at all times” it declares. I’m led to my allotted spot by a couple of kind, middle-aged stewards who are wearing their claret and blue masks as chin warmers. “You can’t move from there” they tell me “and you must wear your mask at all times”. “No problem,” I say as Jamie Redknapp brushes past me looking very dapper in a navy suit but mask-free. A member of ground-staff comes to disinfect the corner flag near me. As I pick up my camera, he is told by a colleague “put your mask on properly, you’re having your picture taken”.The atmosphere inside all the grounds is very strange and eerie. These are stadia I know so well yet it all seems unfamiliar. It’s a real sensory scramble, not only visually but also aurally. I was at Goodison Park for the Everton v Liverpool match, sat in the front row of the Gwladys Street End. Normally a febrile atmosphere emanates from the home fans in that stand, scorn pouring down on anything red. Around me this time are acres of tarpaulin sheets adorned with faces of the Everton faithful. A couple of metres away sits John Powell, Liverpool’s official photographer. “Lovely isn’t it?” he jokes.With 10 minutes left, and the game tied 0-0, Tom Davies hits the inside of the post and Everton are denied a famous winner. It is such a dramatic moment but all I can hear, apart from a couple of expletives from players, are the mellow tunes of a jazz saxophonist playing Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty from outside the ground. After a few matches I start to get used to the noise of these games. You can hear everything the players, coaches and referees say – it’s quite illuminating. There is so much shouting from the players I begin to wonder how they have the energy to run around. It takes me back to park football, refreshing to hear that multi-millionaires can still say such well-known football phrases as “Man on”, “Push Up”, “Keeper’s ball” or “Pull your finger out” although the last one did include a swear word as well.It’s fascinating to see how clubs have adapted to the rules laid down by the Premier League and government health advisers. Goodison Park’s notoriously tight tunnel means the away team change in a portable building in the car park, while at Tottenham the home team have shifted their changing room to the other side of the ground where the huge, expansive NFL rooms are situated. It’s also meant a lot more work for ground-staff, as they have disinfecting duties with balls, corner flags and goalposts.At Norwich they have an old-fashioned bucket of Dettol to drop balls into, while at Spurs they have armed their staff with Ghostbusters-style backpacks to spray down the posts. Even with all these safety requirements, things can go slightly awry. I was at Watford, positioned near the sideline where the substitutes were warming up. In the stand behind the dugouts the subs had carefully distanced seats to sit in, but as they started to stretch their limbs they gathered in a tight bunch, completely blocking my view of the game. One Watford player put his leg onto the board right by my camera, looked at me in my mask a couple of feet away, realised he was far too close to an amber zone non-tester, and moved away sharpish. After talking to his fellow subs, they all scarpered giving me a lovely clear view again.At Anfield last week, just after Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold arched that beautiful free-kick into the top of the Crystal Palace net, I could clearly hear a commentator eagerly describing the goal, even though he was high up in the Centenary Stand, probably a hundred yards away. It made me think what that stadium would have been like if the crowd had been there and I felt sad for them, deprived of seeing a moment like that in the flesh.I hope that before too long they will back and that the abnormality of behind-closed-doors football will soon be consigned to history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5d25fc33389e4cf96895ee55e059c096613bb7/0_255_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35b507d282840afabe8a4114f86ef02","title":"complicated history of swing low sweet chariot needs to be taught and honoured","story":"It’s been sung at Twickenham since at least the mid-60s but it’s now time to respect the spirit behind its undeniable powerEven back before it became a flashpoint in the culture wars, there were all sorts of stories about why, how and when the Twickenham crowd took to singing Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. For a long time it was supposed to have started as a spontaneous celebration of Chris Oti’s hat-trick against Ireland in 1988. Then a researcher turned up footage of fans singing it at the Middlesex Sevens in 1987, when Martin Offiah was playing for Rosslyn Park. Which fits, since his nickname was “Chariots” Offiah. In the past few weeks that seems to have become something like the official history. But the truth is not so neat.Take this, from an article written by Ivor Turnbull published in Tatler on 26 November 1966: “One of the more agreeable vocal traditions of the West Park bar at Twickenham has disappeared as the result of the authorities’ decision to split the old 30-yards-long bar into something like a cell block. The West Bar was always the gathering place for the most determinedly cheerful supporters after a big game and it accounts for a fair proportion of the 20,000 pints that are consumed after an international.“Sooner or later some group would start to sing Swing Low, Sweet Chariot and, in a minute or so, the several hundred beer-charged customers, already packed shoulder to shoulder, would sway as one man. As togetherness, it would have delighted Billy Graham.”So they’ve been singing Swing Low at Twickenham since at least the mid-60s. The real origins of the song go back a hundred years again and they’re pretty obscure, even though it’s often attributed to a Choctaw freedman called Wallace Willis. Arthur Jones, Professor Emeritus of Music, History, and Culture at the University of Denver explains: “I know there’s a story about Wallace Willis, but in the oral history there are just all kinds of accounts of this song having been a slave song, and Wallace probably learned it that way.”Jones describes Swing Low as a signal song: “On one level it’s about people hoping they can escape their misery by riding on this imaginary chariot to heaven, but another clear meaning is the idea that the chariot is a metaphor for escaping to freedom.”Jones has been singing these songs since he was a child. He set up the Spirituals Project to preserve and revitalise them. He knows nothing about rugby and didn’t know Swing Low had been adopted by England’s fans until a journalist told him in 2017. “When I first heard I was shocked, I was told that people sang it in pubs, and that it had evolved some blue connotations, and if that was true I felt like that was truly disrespectful.”It is true, there are a set of idiotic gestures that used to sometimes go along with the song. It’s also true that you seldom – if ever – see fans using them any more.Jones says there are “extremists who say ‘if you’re not black you can’t sing these songs’”. He disagrees. “That’s ridiculous. I feel like if the song is being sung by the fans when their team scores, if they know the origins, and want to borrow it, if it is a fun, positive thing for them to do, then that’s OK. But for people to vehemently distort its history, or claim it belongs to them, that’s really disrespectful.”You couldn’t ban it anyway, (although the Nazi party did put it on a list of “undesired and harmful” songs). “You can’t contain something that has that much cultural power,” Jones says. “It has to be shared and even if you don’t want to share it, it is going to be shared.”Swing Low has that power. Which is why it’s been sung by so many people, including Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash and Joan Baez. “Most of those artists would acknowledge that they love singing it but it’s a song that comes out of the African-American tradition of slave songs,” Jones says “It’s important to do that. One of the reasons why this topic is so sensitive is that one of the few things African-American people can claim that they own is their culture, like songs and stories and games, that originally didn’t have any money attached to them. So there is a lot of sensitivity attached to people taking them. It’s like you’re taking everything from us.“Music does evolve, it changes. We have African-American opera singers who sing Puccini and Mozart, but they treat those songs with respect, they acknowledge the origins and they honour the roots of the music.”That, beneath the inflammatory headlines, beyond all the back-and-forth of opinions, is the crux of it. The Rugby Football Union has commercialised this song and profited from it. While they are running reviews into its use they could look at some other things, too. Look at whether, for instance, they ought to do more to honour the forgotten black international Jimmy Peters. For 118 years, Peters was the only black man to play for England. There are still unanswered questions about whether the prejudice he faced cut short his international career.Look at why, even though the England team is more erse than it has ever been, the 14-person RFU board doesn’t have a single BAME member and why there is only one black person among the 61 on the RFU Council. Look at why Sport England’s recent Sport For All survey showed the Asian and Black communities were significantly under-represented in youth and adult rugby in England compared to other ethnic groups.The RFU wants to improve “education and awareness” about Swing Low, that’s easy to do – consult experts, like Jones, put up plaques, put out films, take down sponsored banners. The more important part is far harder and that’s pushing through the structural change that honours the spirit of the song."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e029471efdd29979782b3b6b38e2004bcca58a11/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a51d8b6cd8c4f71a0ae05e1300b1878d","title":"f1 2020 team by team guide to the cars and drivers","story":"Lewis Hamilton has repeatedly had an edge over the field with Mercedes and this time he can match Michael Schumacher’s record of seven world titlesAlready six-time consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ champions, achieving the seventh double is entirely feasible. Their car is clearly strong, operationally they are the benchmark and their innovative dual-axis steering system proves they are still relentlessly chasing every edge. In a shortened season, reliability and consistency will be key and Mercedes are pre-eminent in both. Still the team to beat.Focused and driven like never before, Hamilton is at the peak of his powers and if he secures a seventh title would match Michael Schumacher’s record. Has repeatedly proved to have a maturity, skill and the race-craft to return success that is unmatched on the current grid. Strong favourite.Started strongly last season only to be swamped by Hamilton as the world champion found his rhythm. The Finn must be quick out of the blocks again but more than ever needs to sustain his charge if he is to put his teammate under any pressure.Car SF1000 Engine Ferrari Principal Mattia Binotto Debut Monaco 1950 GPs 991 Titles 16 Last season 2ndAppeared down on pace in testing and have since admitted taking the wrong direction in aero design but changes will not arrive until Hungary. The Scuderia have focused on improving the car’s downforce to make it more competitive at a greater number of circuits. Aggressive and successful development will be key, along with the potentially difficult task of keeping the peace between their drivers.Out-raced by his rookie teammate last season, Vettel has a point to prove but with Ferrari not renewing his contract and Charles Leclerc in favour his No 1 status is long gone. Still prone to errors under pressure, he needs the serenity of success from the off.Hugely impressive last season, seven poles the best tally of any driver. Will be even more confident and more aggressive this time. Ferrari have said they will let their drivers race so Leclerc will look to put Vettel under the cosh immediately.In testing, the closest rivals to Mercedes. The RB16 looks strong and Honda’s engine close to parity with Mercedes and Ferrari. Confidence is high that they can really challenge and for the first time in recent years appear to be quick out of the box, the Red Bulls pleasingly resurgent.Showing every indication of being a more complete driver, Verstappen has all the tools to fight for the title and if he has the car this year, intends to grasp his chance. Never intimidated and with control to match his exuberance, he can take the fight to Mercedes.Parachuted in from Toro Rosso midway through his rookie season, the London-born driver who races under the Thai flag was hugely impressive. Earned his place and can be expected to only improve. Must be in the mix at the front to support Verstappen.Building on their strongest result since 2012, best of the rest remains the target as McLaren reap the rewards of a structural changes. Their car still has room for improvement but showing consistency and focus, McLaren and their two charging drivers will expect to be in the fight for fourth.Last year he delivered on the promise he has always shown, so much so that Ferrari have signed him for 2021. Sainz has touch and intelligence, is comfortable and confident at McLaren and will want to bid farewell with a flourish.An outstanding debut last season that included some remarkable qualifying runs, outshining his more experienced teammate was just the platform Norris needed. Determined to work on his weaknesses and now entirely confident in an F1 car, he will be even stronger second time out.Disappointing last season performing poorly for a works team targeting the title, Renault have to be in the fight for fourth, especially with the company considering its future in F1. The driver pairing is strong, but it is Esteban Ocon who may have inherited the No 1 spot after Daniel Ricciardo’s decision to jump ship to McLaren for 2021.After a scrappy 2019 Ricciardo wants more. He has the class to deliver but has been frustrated by Renault’s failure to move forward. Still one of the best overtakers, but the Australian may have to take some early licks as the team come up to speed.Back from a year out after two seasons with Force India, Ocon is highly rated and will expect to prove it in a decent car. The Frenchman has speed, consistency and no little bravura in being unafraid to get his elbows out. Potentially a compelling combination.Rebranded and with a fetching new livery, testing was positive enough for Tost to posit fifth place as their target and Sainz picked them out as a threat to McLaren. If Honda’s engine delivers they will likely be in that scrap.Demoted mid-season last year from Red Bull, but showed strength in keeping it together to finish well for Toro Rosso, including a second place in Brazil. The car suited him, as it appears to this year, and will be eager to show he has improved.Solid last season for another driver who has been through the Red Bull promotion and demotion mill. Can still impress, as he did with third in Germany last year, but needs to improve his qualifying performances if he is to match his teammate.Took a lot of flak for designing their car around last year’s title winner, the “Pink Mercedes” is unsurprisingly very quick. Will be in the fight for best of the rest and a bullish team have targeted podium finishes. Sustaining their charge across the season may be more challenging.Having made a long-term commitment to the team he has already served for some time, Pérez is the confident and capable pair of hands they need. A proven points scorer, this may be his chance to show how good he is in a fight that could feature the big three.Stroll’s chance to make a point, too. With decent machinery he can prove he is not just driving because of his father’s largesse. To do so he must drastically improve the qualifying performances that have left him repeatedly playing catchup.To follow last year’s aggressive design philosophy, Alfa once more have evolved their concept well how far they can take it is the challenge. Expect early gains but without the resources to develop it much beyond those peaks.F1’s grand old man seems to be enjoying his racing out of the spotlight more than ever. Still on course to take the record for most race starts if the season can deliver enough meetings, Räikkönen is also guaranteed to return points for Alfa.Well beaten by Räikkönen, the Italian needs to step up in his second full season. Unnecessary errors have been costly but he has shown glimpses of pace, particularly in qualifying. Challenging the Finn would be a real achievement.Gene Haas has warned he will consider Haas’s future in F1 based on how his team perform this season. This year’s car has at least eliminated the tyre-wear problems that plagued them but they do not appear particularly quick. Desperately need their drivers to keep it clean too, if not to further enrage Steiner and Haas.Unforced errors and misjudgments have peppered Grosjean’s career yet can on his day be very quick. Struggled with the car last year but looks more comfortable now, his future in F1 surely depends on consistently delivering this time.K-Mag remains fiercely independent, uncompromising and aggressive. Can be compelling to watch, albeit painfully so sometimes for those on his pitwall. If Haas are in a dogfight at the back of the grid, Magnussen could be the tool they need.Rejoining the midfield is the target after last year’s battering, while the proposed sale of the team hangs heavy over them, but they may yet attract the required investment. The car is quicker, has more downforce and is less of a handful to drive, all positive signs. Major advances are not expected but they target making it to Q2 and being in the back-of-the-field fight.Did superbly to weather the storm last year, which he handled impressively. Now team leader, Russell is gaining experience the hard way but he has done so well and his talent will be on show if Williams can get among the other teams.Backed by billionaire father, Michael, he drove six practice sessions for Williams last year and is well-liked at the team. A solid pair of hands for a rookie but must rise to the challenge, as Russell did last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e3cdc8b0cc74e7f07c2383711e41ac220bf9a7/0_157_4321_2592/master/4321.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a47047bfe3e49bd0319f3ff9d210167d","title":"rugby union nations may decide to take pay tvs money and run","story":"Hard times have enhanced the attraction of a £300m deal with CVC that would take the game away from millions of fansAs the Six Nations contemplate an autumn international campaign without New Zealand and South Africa, who are likely to remain at home because of travel restrictions, the attraction of a deal with CVC becomes greater.A £300m bounty at a time when the pandemic has forced the game to make its deepest cuts in the professional era could be the difference between floating and going under.A deal, though, does not appear to be imminent. The lockdown paused negotiations at a time when even private equity companies are having to take stock. But a sticking point remains unresolved: should the tournament move to a lucrative pay television platform or retain a free-to-air presence which may mean CVC reducing its offer?The instinctive reaction is to take the money: the Welsh Rugby Union fears it could face a shortfall of £50m this year with matches at the Principality Stadium unlikely to resume until 2021, and it is considering hiring Twickenham in the autumn. The Rugby Football Union has hit on a similar figure while the Irish union has warned it could run out of money in a matter of months.The measured response is to consider the longer-term impact of taking the most popular tournament in the European game off terrestrial TV and exchanging audiences of several million for viewers who would be numbered in the hundreds of thousands. The Six Nations is the entry point to rugby union for many and the cost of forfeiting a large swathe of interest is not easily, or quickly, quantified.A year ago the Premiership clubs each banked £12.5m after signing an agreement with CVC. The money was timely, with the 13 having generated precious little income in the last three months, but it is also costly.The Six Nations agreed before starting talks with CVC to aggregate their rights, selling the championship and autumn internationals together to enhance their value. They had hoped that the international schedule for later this year would be finalised at a meeting this week. But it has been postponed until the middle of the month because more time is needed to sort out a global calendar. Clubs are unhappy at the prospect of a long Test window in October and November replacing the two held in the European summer and autumn.On the same day, the very different ways East Midlands rivals Leicester and Northampton deal with their players became evident. Northampton, who from the start of the lockdown adopted a collaborative approach with their leading players, have settled their squad for next season, retaining Courtney Lawes, Dan Biggar, Piers Francis, Teimana Harrison, George Furbank and Alex Waller. All have accepted a pay cut until next summer.Leicester’s tactics were played out in the media with the England internationals George Ford, Ellis Genge and Manu Tuilagi among the rebels who tried to hold the club into honouring its pledge to reimburse players for the pay cuts they had agreed between April and August before agreeing to sign a contract on reduced terms.The Tigers’ approach from the start was to dictate to players rather than to negotiate and new coach Steve Borthwick’s first task will be to rebuild morale. Ford and Genge, two players whose participation in the next World Cup will come down to form rather than age, pulled back from the brink and it would be surprising if the England coach, Eddie Jones, had not had a word with them.Tuilagi stood firm, the 2023 World Cup not his priority, although he will be only 32 when the tournament in France starts. He re-signed for Leicester despite interest from Racing 92 and if he is to have a final pay day, it will be in France or Japan: Genge teased his Twitter followers on Wednesday by posting emojis of a croissant and sushi on his page as speculation about his future raged.Pay cuts are more costly for players closer to the end of their careers than the beginning. They will have little chance of making up the shortfall, but if everyone is in this together no one should be exploiting strife, even if Leicester have not helped themselves. It is not, for the moment, a players’ market with employers reducing debt rather than living off it. Tuilagi’s value will be enhanced only if his international career is in the past.• This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

But they hold their own dangers – to those both inside and out.At first, many of the new uses were heartening. Mutual aid groups sprung up to help the vulnerable. Families and friends used the app to stay close, sharing their fears and concerns in real time. Yet by mid-April, the role that WhatsApp was playing in the pandemic looked somewhat darker. A conspiracy theory about the rollout of 5G, which originated long before Covid-19 had appeared, now claimed that mobile phone masts were responsible for the disease. Across the UK, people began setting fire to 5G masts, with 20 arson attacks over the Easter weekend alone.WhatsApp, along with Facebook and YouTube, was a key channel through which the conspiracy theory proliferated. Some feared that the very same community groups created during March were now accelerating the spread of the 5G conspiracy theory. Meanwhile, the app was also enabling the spread of fake audio clips, such as a widely shared recording in which someone who claimed to work for the NHS reported that ambulances would no longer be sent to assist people with breathing difficulties.This was not the first time that WhatsApp has been embroiled in controversy. While the “fake news” scandals surrounding the 2016 electoral upsets in the UK and US were more focused upon Facebook – which owns WhatsApp – subsequent electoral victories for Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Narendra Modi in India were aided by incendiary WhatsApp messaging, exploiting the vast reach of the app in these countries. In India, there have also been reports of riots and at least 30 deaths linked to rumours circulating on WhatsApp. India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has sought ways of regulating WhatsApp content, though this has led to new controversies about government infringement on civil liberties.As ever, there is a risk of pinning too much blame for complex political crises on an inert technology. WhatsApp has also taken some steps to limit its use as a vehicle for misinformation. In March, a WhatsApp spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company had “engaged health ministries around the world to provide simple ways for citizens to receive accurate information about the virus”. But even away from such visible disruptions, WhatsApp does seem to be an unusually effective vehicle for sowing distrust in public institutions and processes.A WhatsApp group can exist without anyone outside the group knowing of its existence, who its members are or what is being shared, while end-to-end encryption makes it immune to surveillance. Back in Britain’s pre-Covid-19 days, when Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn were the issues that provoked the most feverish political discussions, speculation and paranoia swirled around such groups. Media commentators who defended Corbyn were often accused of belonging to a WhatsApp group of “outriders”, co-ordinated by Corbyn’s office, which supposedly told them what line to take. Meanwhile, the Conservative party’s pro-Brexit European Research Group was said to be chiefly sustained in the form of a WhatsApp group, whose membership was never public. Secretive coordination – both real and imagined – does not strengthen confidence in democracy.WhatsApp groups can not only breed suspicion among the public, but also manufacture a mood of suspicion among their own participants. As also demonstrated by closed Facebook groups, discontents – not always well-founded – accumulate in private before boiling over in public. The capacity to circulate misinformation and allegations is becoming greater than the capacity to resolve them.The political threat of WhatsApp is the flipside of its psychological appeal. Unlike so many other social media platforms, WhatsApp is built to secure privacy. On the plus side, this means intimacy with those we care about and an ability to speak freely on the negative side, it injects an ethos of secrecy and suspicion into the public sphere. As Facebook, Twitter and Instagram become increasingly theatrical – every gesture geared to impress an audience or deflect criticism – WhatsApp has become a sanctuary from a confusing and untrustworthy world, where users can speak more frankly. As trust in groups grows, so it is withdrawn from public institutions and officials. A new common sense develops, founded on instinctive suspicion towards the world beyond the group.The ongoing rise of WhatsApp, and its challenge to both legacy institutions and open social media, poses a profound political question: how do public institutions and discussions retain legitimacy and trust once people are organised into closed and invisible communities? The risk is that a vicious circle ensues, in which private groups circulate ever more information and disinformation to discredit public officials and public information, and our alienation from democracy escalates.The features that would later allow WhatsApp to become a conduit for conspiracy theory and political conflict were ones never integral to SMS, and have more in common with email: the creation of groups and the ability to forward messages. The ability to forward messages from one group to another – recently limited in response to Covid-19-related misinformation – makes for a potent informational weapon. Groups were initially limited in size to 100 people, but this was later increased to 256. That’s small enough to feel exclusive, but if 256 people forward a message on to another 256 people, 65,536 will have received it.Groups originate for all sorts of purposes – a party, organising amateur sport, a shared interest – but then take on a life of their own. There can be an anarchic playfulness about this, as a group takes on its own set of in-jokes and traditions. In a New York Magazine piece last year, under the headline “Group chats are making the internet fun again”, the technology critic Max Read argued that groups have become “an outright replacement for the defining mode of social organization of the past decade: the platform-centric, feed-based social network.”It’s understandable that in order to relax, users need to know they’re not being overheard – though there is a less playful side to this. If groups are perceived as a place to say what you really think, away from the constraints of public judgement or “political correctness”, then it follows that they are also where people turn to share prejudices or more hateful expressions, that are unacceptable (or even illegal) elsewhere. Santiago Abascal, the leader of the Spanish far-right party Vox, has defined his party as one willing to “defend what Spaniards say on WhatsApp”.A different type of group emerges where its members are all users of the same service, such as a school, a housing block or a training programme. A potential problem here is one of negative solidarity, in which feelings of community are deepened by turning against the service in question. Groups of this sort typically start from a desire to pool information – students staying in touch about deadlines, say – but can swiftly become a means of discrediting the institution they cluster around. Initial murmurs of dissatisfaction can escalate rapidly, until the group has forged an identity around a spirit of resentment and alienation, which can then be impossible to dislodge with countervailing evidence.Faced with the rise of new technologies, one option for formal organisations and associations is to follow people to their preferred platform. In March, the government introduced a WhatsApp-based information service about Covid-19, with an automated chatbot. But groups themselves can be an unreliable means of getting crucial information to people. Anecdotal evidence from local political organisers and trade union reps suggests that, despite the initial efficiency of WhatsApp groups, their workload often increases because of the escalating number of sub-communities, each of which needs to be contacted separately. Schools desperately seek to get information out to parents, only to discover that unless it appears in precisely the right WhatsApp group, it doesn’t register. The age of the message board, be it physical or digital, where information can be posted once for anyone who needs it, is over.WhatsApp’s ‘broadcast list’ function, which allows messages to be sent to multiple recipients who are invisible to one another (like email’s ‘bcc’ line), alleviates some of the problems of groups taking on a life of their own. But even then, lists can only include people who are already mutual contacts of the list-owner. The problem, from the point of view of institutions, is that WhatsApp use seems fuelled by a preference for informal, private communication as such. University lecturers are frequently baffled by the discovery that many students and applicants don’t read email. If email is going into decline, WhatsApp does not seem to be a viable alternative when it comes to sharing verified information as widely and inclusively as possible.Groups are great for brief bursts of humour or frustration, but, by their very nature, far less useful for supporting the circulation of public information. To understand why this is the case, we have to think about the way in which iniduals can become swayed and influenced once they belong to a group.The internet has brought with it its own litany of social pathologies and threats. Trolling, flaming, doxing, cancelling and pile-ons are all risks that go with socialising within a vast open architecture. “Open” platforms such as Twitter are reminders that much social activity tends to be aimed at a small and select community, but can be rendered comical or shameful when exposed to a different community altogether.As any frequent user of WhatsApp or a closed Facebook group will recognise, the moral anxiety associated with groups is rather different. If the worry in an open network is of being judged by some outside observer, be it one’s boss or an extended family member, in a closed group it is of saying something that goes against the codes that anchor the group’s identity. Groups can rapidly become dominated by a certain tone or worldview that is uncomfortable to challenge and nigh-impossible to dislodge. WhatsApp is a machine for generating feelings of faux pas, as comments linger in a group’s feed, waiting for a response.This means that while groups can generate high levels of solidarity, which can in principle be put to powerful political effect, it also becomes harder to express disagreement within the group. If, for example, an outspoken and popular member of a neighbourhood WhatsApp group begins to circulate misinformation about health risks, the general urge to maintain solidarity means that their messages are likely to be met with approval and thanks. When a claim or piece of content shows up in a group, there may be many members who view it as dubious the question is whether they have the confidence to say as much. Meanwhile, the less sceptical can simply forward it on. It’s not hard, then, to understand why WhatsApp is a powerful distributor of “fake news” and conspiracy theories.As on open social platforms, one of the chief ways of building solidarity on WhatsApp is to posit some injustice or enemy that threatens the group and its members. In the most acute examples, conspiracy theories are unleashed against political opponents, to the effect that they are paedophiles or secret affiliates of foreign powers. Such plausibly deniable practices swirled around the fringes of the successful election campaigns of Modi, Bolsonaro and Donald Trump, and across multiple platforms.But what makes WhatsApp potentially more dangerous than public social media are the higher levels of trust and honesty that are often present in private groups. It is a truism that nobody is as happy as they appear on Facebook, as attractive as they appear on Instagram or as angry as they appear on Twitter, which spawns a growing weariness with such endless performance. By contrast, closed groups are where people take off their public masks and let their critical guard down. Neither anonymity (a precondition of most trolling) nor celebrity are on offer. The speed with which rumours circulate on WhatsApp is partly a reflection of how altruistic and uncritical people can be in groups. Most of the time, people seem to share false theories about Covid-19 not with the intention of doing harm, but precisely out of concern for other group members. Anti-vaxx, anti-5G or anti-Hillary rumours combine an identification of an enemy with a strong internal sense of solidarity. Nevertheless, they add to the sense that the world is hostile and dangerous.There is one particular pattern of a group chat that can manufacture threats and injustices out of thin air. It tends to start with one participant speculating that they are being let down or targeted by some institution or rival group – be it a public service, business or cultural community – whereupon a second participant agrees. By this stage, it becomes risky for anyone else to defend the institution or group in question, and immediately a new enemy and a new resentment is born. Instantly, the warnings and denunciations emanating from within the group take on a level of authenticity that cannot be matched by the entity that is now the object of derision.But what if the first contributor has misunderstood or misread something, or had a very stressful day and needs to let off steam? And what if the second is merely agreeing so as to make the first one feel better? And what if the other members are either too distracted, too inhibited or too exhausted to say anything to oppose this fresh indignation? This needn’t snowball into the forms of conspiracy theory that produce riots or arson attacks. But even in milder forms, it makes the job of communicating official information – occasionally life-saving information – far more troublesome than it was just a decade ago. Information about public services and health risks is increasingly having to penetrate a thicket of overlapping groups, many of which may have developed an instinctive scepticism to anything emanating from the “mainstream”.Part of the challenge for institutions is that there is often a strange emotional comfort in the shared feeling of alienation and passivity. “We were never informed about that”, “nobody consulted us”, “we are being ignored”. These are dominant expressions of our political zeitgeist. As WhatsApp has become an increasingly common way of encountering information and news, a vicious circle can ensue: the public world seems ever more distant, impersonal and fake, and the private group becomes a space of sympathy and authenticity.This is a new twist in the evolution of the social internet. Since the 90s, the internet has held out a promise of connectivity, openness and inclusion, only to then confront inevitable threats to privacy, security and identity. By contrast, groups make people feel secure and anchored, but also help to fragment civil society into separate cliques, unknown to one another. This is the outcome of more than 20 years of ideological battles over what sort of social space the internet should be.For a few years at the dawn of the millennium, the O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conferences (or ETech), were a crucible in which a new digital world was imagined and debated. Launched by the west coast media entrepreneur Tim O’Reilly and hosted annually around California, the conferences attracted a mixture of geeks, gurus, designers and entrepreneurs, brought together more in a spirit of curiosity than of commerce. In 2005, O’Reilly coined the term “web 2.0” to describe a new wave of websites that connected users with each other, rather than with existing offline institutions. Later that year, the domain name facebook was purchased by a 21-year-old Harvard student, and the age of the giant social media platforms was born.Within this short window of time, we can see competing ideas of what a desirable online community might look like. The more idealistic tech gurus who attended ETech insisted that the internet should remain an open public space, albeit one in which select communities could cluster for their own particular purposes, such as creating open-source software projects or Wikipedia entries. The untapped potential of the internet, they believed, was for greater democracy. But for companies such as Facebook, the internet presented an opportunity to collect data about users en masse. The internet’s potential was for greater surveillance. The rise of the giant platforms from 2005 onwards suggested the latter view had won out. And yet, in a strange twist, we are now witnessing a revival of anarchic, self-organising digital groups – only now, in the hands of Facebook as well. The two competing visions have collided.To see how this story unfolded, it’s worth going back to 2003. At the ETech conference that year, a keynote speech was given by the web enthusiast and writer Clay Shirky, now an academic at New York University, which surprised its audience by declaring that the task of designing successful online communities had little to do with technology at all. The talk looked back at one of the most fertile periods in the history of social psychology, and was entitled “A group is its own worst enemy”.Shirky drew on the work of the British psychoanalyst and psychologist Wilfred Bion, who, together with Kurt Lewin, was one of the pioneers of the study of “group dynamics” in the 40s. The central proposition of this school was that groups possess psychological properties that exist independently of their inidual members. In groups, people find themselves behaving in ways that they never would if left to their own devices.Like Stanley Milgram’s notorious series of experiments to test obedience in the early 60s – in which some participants were persuaded to administer apparently painful electric shocks to others – the mid-20th century concern with group dynamics grew in the shadow of the political horrors of the 30s and 40s, which had posed grave questions about how iniduals come to abandon their ordinary sense of morality. Lewin and Bion posited that groups possess distinctive personalities, which emerge organically through the interaction of their members, independently of what rules they might have been given, or what iniduals might rationally do alone.With the dawn of the 60s, and its more inidualistic political hopes, psychologists’ interest in groups started to wane. The assumption that iniduals are governed by conformity fell by the wayside. When Shirky introduced Bion’s work at the O’Reilly conference in 2003, he was going out on a limb. What he correctly saw was that, in the absence of any explicit structures or rules, online communities were battling against many of the disruptive dynamics that fascinated the psychologists of the 40s.Shirky highlighted one area of Bion’s work in particular: how groups can spontaneously sabotage their own stipulated purpose. The beauty of early online communities, such as listservs, message boards and wikis, was their spirit of egalitarianism, humour and informality. But these same properties often worked against them when it came to actually getting anything constructive done, and could sometimes snowball into something obstructive or angry. Once the mood of a group was erted towards jokes, disruption or hostility towards another group, it became very difficult to wrest it back.Bion’s concerns originated in fear of humanity’s darker impulses, but the vision Shirky was putting to his audience that day was a more optimistic one. If the designers of online spaces could preempt disruptive “group dynamics”, he argued, then it might be possible to support cohesive, productive online communities that remained open and useful at the same time. Like a well designed park or street, a well-designed online space might nurture healthy sociability without the need for policing, surveillance or closure to outsiders. Between one extreme of anarchic chaos (constant trolling), and another of strict moderation and regulation of discussion (acceding to an authority figure), thinking in terms of group dynamics held out the promise of a social web that was still largely self-organising, but also relatively orderly.But there was another solution to this same problem waiting in the wings, which would turn out to be world-changing in its consequences: forget group dynamics, and focus on reputation dynamics instead. If someone online has a certain set of offline attributes, such as a job title, an album of tagged photos, a list of friends and an email address, they will behave themselves in ways that are appropriate to all of these fixed public identifiers. Add more and more surveillance into the mix, both by one’s peers and by corporations, and the problem of spontaneous group dynamics disappears. It is easier to hold on to your self-control and your conscience if you are publicly visible, including to friends, extended family and colleagues.For many of the Californian pioneers of cyberculture, who cherished online communities as an escape from the values and constraints of capitalist society, Zuckerberg’s triumph represents an unmitigated defeat. Corporations were never meant to seize control of this space. As late as 2005, the hope was that the social web would be built around democratic principles and bottom-up communities. Facebook abandoned all of that, by simply turning the internet into a multimedia telephone directory.The last ETech was held in 2009. Within a decade, Facebook was being accused of pushing liberal democracy to the brink and even destroying truth itself. But as the demands of social media have become more onerous, with each of us curating a profile and projecting an identity, the lure of the autonomous group has resurfaced once again. In some respects, Shirky’s optimistic concern has now become today’s pessimistic one. Partly thanks to WhatsApp, the unmoderated, self-governing, amoral collective – larger than a conversation, smaller than a public – has become a dominant and disruptive political force in our society, much as figures such as Bion and Lewin feared.Conspiracy theories and paranoid group dynamics were features of political life long before WhatsApp arrived. It makes no sense to blame the app for their existence, any more than it makes sense to blame Facebook for Brexit. But by considering the types of behaviour and social structures that technologies enable and enhance, we get a better sense of some of society’s characteristics and ailments. What are the general tendencies that WhatsApp helps to accelerate?First of all, there is the problem of conspiracies in general. WhatsApp is certainly an unbeatable conduit for circulating conspiracy theories, but we must also admit that it seems to be an excellent tool for facilitating genuinely conspiratorial behaviour. One of the great difficulties when considering conspiracy theories in today’s world is that, regardless of WhatsApp, some conspiracies turn out to be true: consider Libor-fixing, phone-hacking, or efforts by Labour party officials to thwart Jeremy Corbyn’s electoral prospects. These all happened, but one would have sounded like a conspiracy theorist to suggest them until they were later confirmed by evidence.A communication medium that connects groups of up to 256 people, without any public visibility, operating via the phones in their pockets, is by its very nature, well-suited to supporting secrecy. Obviously not every group chat counts as a “conspiracy”. But it makes the question of how society coheres, who is associated with whom, into a matter of speculation – something that involves a trace of conspiracy theory. In that sense, WhatsApp is not just a channel for the circulation of conspiracy theories, but offers content for them as well. The medium is the message.The full political potential of WhatsApp has not been witnessed in the UK. To date, it has not served as an effective political campaigning tool, partly because users seem reluctant to join large groups with people they don’t know. However, the influence – imagined or real – of WhatsApp groups within Westminster and the media undoubtedly contributes to the deepening sense that public life is a sham, behind which lurk invisible networks through which power is coordinated. WhatsApp has become a kind of “backstage” of public life, where it is assumed people articulate what they really think and believe in secret. This is a sensibility that has long fuelled conspiracy theories, especially antisemitic ones. Invisible WhatsApp groups now offer a modern update to the type of “explanation” that once revolved around Masonic lodges or the Rothschilds.Away from the world of party politics and news media, there is the prospect of a society organised as a tapestry of overlapping cliques, each with their own internal norms. Groups are less likely to encourage heterodoxy or risk-taking, and more likely to inculcate conformity, albeit often to a set of norms hostile to those of the “mainstream”, whether that be the media, politics or professional public servants simply doing their jobs. In the safety of the group, it becomes possible to have one’s cake and eat it, to be simultaneously radical and orthodox, hyper-sceptical and yet unreflective.For all the benefits that WhatsApp offers in helping people feel close to others, its rapid ascendency is one further sign of how a common public world – based upon verified facts and recognised procedures – is disintegrating. WhatsApp is well equipped to support communications on the margins of institutions and public discussion: backbenchers plotting coups, parents gossipping about teachers, friends sharing edgy memes, journalists circulating rumours, family members forwarding on unofficial medical advice. A society that only speaks honestly on the margins like this will find it harder to sustain the legitimacy of experts, officials and representatives who, by definition, operate in the spotlight. Meanwhile, distrust, alienation and conspiracy theories become the norm, chipping away at the institutions that might hold us together. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b33ad00411039588c31265caee61df9958e97999/0_41_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b677b8909da8ccc9b9232635f4db4d73","title":"10 of the best uk campsites readers travel tips","story":"Combining open air with social distancing, a stay at a UK campsite will be a popular option this year. Readers reveal their favouritesWhenever people complain that the UK isn’t a holiday destination, I think of Three Cliffs Bay near Swansea. I first went as a child, and have remained in love ever since. The campsite looks over a sheltered lagoon with three rocky crags, huge sand dunes and rock faces you can scramble up. It’s a perfect campsite for families because of the facilities and surrounding nature. Apart from the incredible view, my favourite thing is how close it is to the beach – very tempting for a morning swim. I can’t wait to go back. • Open to caravans and motorhomes from 13 July, for camping (from £24 a night) from 1 Sept, no glamping till 2021, threecliffsbayAlex SmithDoward Park campsite is on the edge of the Forest of Dean between Ross-on-Wye and Monmouth, two of the loveliest towns to snout around. Facilities are basic, but kids will love the woodland play area. Local attractions include magnificent walks through the forest, starting only steps away from the site. Scramble down past recently inhabited (and magically explorable) caves to Symonds Yat and spy a peregrine falcon, or investigate a surprising industrial history of the nearby forest where iron was smelted beside the river.

The comic and TV presenter began to hyperventilate and cry behind his goggles. “I can’t do it,” he pleaded repeatedly as he thrashed around. “I felt extremely disabled for the first time in as long as I can remember because my body just wasn’t doing what I wanted it to,” he says over the phone from his home in London.As has become the norm for Brooker, the entire ordeal was captured on camera and televised as part of Channel 4’s charity reality show Sink Or Swim. Brooker was born with hand and arm deformities, and became a leg amputee at 13 months old. He rose to prominence with self-deprecating takes on his disability during the Friday night topical chatshow The Last Leg, which began as part of Channel 4’s coverage of the Paralympics in London. He is one of the few disabled faces regularly seen on British TV, but it has only been over the past year that he decided to confront his disability without the jokes, leading to a new documentary on BBC Two this Sunday.“Most days I don’t think about my disability at all, but doing that swim brought it clearly into focus,” he says. “It made me realise it was time now, as a father of two, to take more responsibility over my disability and to find out more about it.” Despite a childhood spent having multiple operations and checkups at Great Ormond Street hospital, Brooker had not been to see a doctor for 17 years before the documentary was filmed. “I’d been having this pain in my left leg for the longest time, but I was too scared to go to the doctor in case it was bad news,” he says. “When my wife was pregnant, I remember going to the scans and these doctors would be checking that my child wouldn’t be deformed like me – even though my disability isn’t genetic – and that makes you so self-conscious of everything. I would be worrying I might drop the kids or how they would react to me being different.”One of the most emotional and frank parts of the film is when Brooker meets Lee, a fellow Arsenal supporter and recent paraplegic, and the pair talk of their concerns about being disabled dads.“Disabled people all get lumped together under the umbrella term of disability, but of course we’re all different,” he says. “There’s a big difference between me being an amputee from when I was 13 months old to someone who’s lost their leg in an accident. I don’t know the pain associated with losing a limb and I don’t know the rehab. So meeting Lee and listening to how his life changed completely was so emotional. I took a lot from that. He said to me: ‘You’ll always be the dad to your kids, you’ll never be anything different whether you’re disabled or not,’ and I got very emotional then because I’ve never had that conversation. I’ve never told anyone because it’s really scared the shit out of me.”In fact, Brooker’s eldest daughter recently noticed his disability for the first time. “It was a moment I’ve worried about all my life,” he says. “What if my kids are scared of me? But my daughter was holding my hand and just said: ‘Oh, you’ve got two fingers haven’t you and I’ve got four,’ and that was it. It was all done and dusted in five seconds. I thought to myself: ‘I’ve been worrying about this for 25 years, you could have made a bit more out of it!’ She’s three now and she’s been able to count above two for a while, so really I was looking at this as a marker of her progress in mathematics as well.”Making light of difficult situations is a hallmark of Brooker’s comedy and something he believes empowers him. “Self-deprecating humour is a common form of comedy and it helps get the audience on side because you’re being vulnerable,” he says. “Being able to joke about my disability also gives me some control over it. My disability makes me emotional, but it also makes me laugh the two are not mutually exclusive and I’m comfortable doing both. Joking about it can be a celebration of it, too.”Brooker got his start on television after he sent in an audition tape to be a presenter for Channel 4’s 2012 Paralympics coverage. “After a while, I stopped being the guy with the hands to just the guy on telly and desensitising people to that was a really big hurdle. The more disabled people there are on screen, the more likely that is to have a bigger impact in society,” he says. “There’s still obviously nowhere near the representation of disabled people that there should be, but progress is happening slowly. It’s a much better landscape from when I first started.”Ultimately, Brooker hopes his documentary will help shine a light not only on his experiences but on the all-too-common difficulties faced by disabled people in the UK. “We filmed this last year before the lockdown and what I think the lockdown has shown is that not being able to leave the house can be a daily occurrence for disabled people, no matter the state of the outside world,” he says. “I hope it will make people more empathetic to our experiences and for disabled people to understand that talking about our difficulties can really help us not be afraid of who we are.”Is he worried about showing such a raw, emotional side to himself? “It was a tough process, but I don’t see that emotion as a negative I’ve cried on telly loads now and it’s cathartic,” he says. “Disabled people don’t want to complain, they just want a fair crack at the best chance to live. You’ve already got restrictions in your own bodies, so you don’t need it when you leave the house in the morning, too.”Alex Brooker: Disability and Me is on BBC Two on 5 July at 9pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd093f9f860eef3c69ac6426af3784dfd0fc02f/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2c54b349f58c9eec4f02d6569173fb","title":"covid 19 young people america coronavirus","story":"Doctors are seeing more and more young patients – and health experts are urging young people to take the virus seriouslyUntil recently, the majority of coronavirus cases that Dr Quinn Snyder, an emergency doctor at one of Arizona’s largest emergency departments, saw were older people. But since mid-May, when the state’s stay-at-home order was lifted, and particularly after the Memorial Day holiday, the demographic has shifted.Snyder says he has seen an “explosion” in cases among 20-44 year-olds.Some of those, he said, are coming in severely ill – requiring oxygen, intubation and ventilators. “We even had people in that age group die, unfortunately. So it’s very troubling and it’s very difficult to watch young people die from this disease. It’s horrible.”Speaking ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend, health experts in hotspot states – which include Arizona, Texas and Florida – warned numbers will continue to rise and that if young people do not take better precautions, hospitals will reach capacity and states could be left with no choice but to completely shut down.Factors thought to have contributed to the surge in cases amongst younger people include graduation parties, mixed public messaging, higher risk tolerance and bars.Around half of Arizona’s almost 80,000 cases fall into the 20-44-year-old age bracket. Nightclubs and bars – closed this week as part of Republican governor Doug Ducey’s “pause” of reopening in an attempt to stop the spread – are the “primary reservoir” for the disease, said Snyder.He wants to see a stay-at-home order and urged young people to stay at home.“The truth is that if we are going to contain this pandemic, if we are going to prevent our hospitals from overflowing, it’s absolutely critical that people in the 20-44-year-old age group take much more precautions than they currently are taking and stay at home.”Some state and federal officials – including Donald Trump - have put the rise in US cases down to increased testing. But Dr Katherine Ellingson, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Arizona, said this is definitely not the case in Arizona, where she said “the rise in Covid testing has not kept pace with the rise in cases”.She said: “The trends are highly concerning … it’s very likely that we will see conditions worsen before they get better.”Between late March and late June, Ellingson said the mean age of new cases in the state dropped from 51 to 38. She puts the change down to a combination of factors including businesses reopening, the end of the stay-at-home order and a general “quarantine fatigue”.She said young people should take precautions including mask wearing, avoiding large gatherings, maintaining physical distance and hand hygiene. She added: “When we look at accounts of super-spreading events we see some common themes: people indoors and in close proximity, doing things like eating, drinking, singing, or exercising.”In Florida, Republican governor Ron DeSantis has acknowledged that cases “are shifting in a radical direction younger”, but this week vowed not to rollback reopening – despite a huge spike in cases.The state has, however, issued a moratorium on consumption of alcohol at bars.Mary Jo Trepka, professor and chair of the department of epidemiology at Florida International University, said the median age of recent cases in the state has been in the 30s. On June 23 it was 33, currently it’s 37.“That means that half of the people are 37 or younger who are testing positive for covid-19,” she said. “That’s really pretty remarkable, how large that number is, especially since you would still think that more frail people would be more likely to be identified because they’re going to have more severe illness.”On Tuesday there were 152,434 total cases in Florida – a rise of 6,012 on the previous day – and 3,505 deaths. Trepka said the true number of cases is likely to be even higher because data undercounts younger people who are more likely to be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms.“The message early on, probably so people didn’t completely panic, was that ‘OK, this is a lot like the flu, the very elderly are most at risk, but the young people are much less risk’. And while that’s still true of course, once you start getting a lot of young people that are infected, some of those people will be hospitalized and some may die.”The increase in infections among young people poses a significant risk to older people – especially in multi-generational households, which she says is “very worrisome”.While new measures such as the restriction on bars, fines for not wearing masks in Miami Beach and beach closures in some counties may help, Trepka said it will take at least two weeks before their impact is felt. In the meantime, she predicts, cases will continue to go up.“Are we going to have a complete shutdown? I hope not, but it all depends on what happens in the hospitals.”Experts say that bars have become a hotbed for transmission – particularly as people drink and lose their inhibitions.Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease doctor and a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, said bars are “coming up in multiple case investigations”.“Because of the very nature of being at a bar is a social function, it’s much less likely that you’re going to see social distancing be observed there and people, as they drink alcohol, they may talk louder, they may yell, cheer, sing and scream.“It does pose a higher risk for transmission. And most bars are indoors as well.”After stay-at-home orders were lifted, he said many people wrongly took it as a “green light that things were safe”.There was, he added, “a lot of pent-up desire to interact and to go to bars and do things that they couldn’t do for the last couple of months and that’s what you’re seeing – basically like everybody turning 21 all of a sudden”.Bar closures could have some impact, but he fears it could lead to people being “driven underground” to house parties and believes spread among younger age groups will continue which could then start chains of transmission among older and vulnerable people.Dr Spencer Fox, associate director of the UT Austin Covid-19 Modelling Consortium, said: “What we’re seeing in Texas are rises in cases in young people … We’ve seen large upticks in the absolute number of hospital patients who are in younger demographics.”Their current working hypothesis is that younger people, who are lower risk, were more likely to resume socialising when the state started reopening.If action isn’t taken by authorities and younger people continue this behaviour, he said the spread they will “continue to see exponential growth – in cases, infections, hospitalisations and mortality”.Fox also fears it will lead to surges among older age groups too.“I really do hope that seeing upticks in the young population being hospitalised is a wake-up call to people in those age groups, that even though they are maybe less likely to have a negative consequence, it’s still happening, and it’s happening at a rate that is pretty alarming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f84d02c495eaabd1202eca830628028b9a7ad77/0_237_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f24f1d63b25ca18a90552af2e3d835d","title":"jordan bans smoking and vaping in indoor public spaces","story":"Decision follows recent revelation country has highest rates of tobacco use in the worldThe Jordanian government has banned smoking and vaping in all indoor public spaces a week after a  investigation revealed tobacco use in the country had become the highest in the world.Larissa Al-Uar, from the activist group Tobacco Free Jordan, said the announcement was a “huge change”.“We’re happy, but we need to see strong implementation of the law. Without that, it will be a disaster.”She said previous efforts to curb the country’s record-high smoking rates had suffered from weak enforcement as well as what health advocates claimed was widespread interference in policymaking by multinational tobacco companies.A  investigation found that tobacco company lobbyists had been regularly invited to sit in on meetings to debate regulations on their products, in what campaigners claimed was inappropriate interference in policymaking.It also found big tobacco had been publicly lauded for paying to refurbish schools, providing students with schoolbags and equipment, and running career development sessions for young people – which anti-smoking activists characterised as an attempt to promote their image.Tobacco companies including British American Tobacco said their involvement in regulatory debates was appropriate and lawful, and that their charitable donations were driven by a commitment to the community.Smoking will still be permitted in outdoor areas of hotels, cafes and restaurants under the new regulations. In media interviews over the past week, campaigners have urged the government to focus on enforcing existing smoking bans in a country where tobacco use is linked to one in five deaths, compared with one in 10 globally.Jordanian men who smoke daily consume an average of 23 cigarettes a day, the 2019 nationalWHO survey found.In its announcement on Wednesday, the Jordanian government cited studies showing that smokers and those who consumed secondhand smoke were more susceptible to harm if they caught coronavirus, a link that Al-Uar hoped would prompt a re-evaluation of smoking among legislators and the public. “We hope that connecting smoking and Covid-19 will have a positive effect,” she said.Though it borders several countries with significant coronavirus outbreaks, Jordan’s government has overseen one of the world’s most successful Covid-19 responses, declaring earlier this week that the kingdom had effectively ended community transmission of the virus, and that public curfews and lockdowns would be scrapped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa22890f54992dd4cbfb7fd07f9046e983905843/0_481_3864_2319/master/3864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c512985f8f7d0bc49ed1f17c61278f6c","title":"brussels to name public square after bronte sisters","story":"Tribute is part of ‘feminisation’ of public places in city, where two sisters studied FrenchA square in Brussels will be named after the Brontë sisters, the first tribute of its kind in the Belgian capital, more than 178 years after Charlotte and Emily arrived in the city to study French.Councillors in the north-west district of Koekelberg voted to name a square “Place des Sœurs Brontë” in French, or “Zusters Brontë plein” in Dutch, as part of a wider plan for the “feminisation” of public places. The local authority found that the vast majority of its streets and squares named after a person commemorated men.The resolution in favour of renaming the square describes the three sisters – including Anne Brontë, who never went to Brussels – as “models of emancipation”.“It is for us a tribute to the literary talents of the Brontë sisters and an honour for the commune of Koekelberg to commemorate the presences of two of the three sisters in our municipality,” said Ahmed Laaouej, the socialist mayor of Koekelberg.The square is being redeveloped – it has recently been pedestrianised – and is home to the local Dutch-language cultural centre and library. The new name is expected to be made official in early 2021 as part of a street renaming programme.Charlotte and Emily Brontë arrived in Brussels in February 1842, aged 25 and 23. It was their first and only trip abroad. The sisters hoped that improving their languages would help them open a boarding school at their home of Haworth Parsonage – a plan that never came to pass as they turned to writing novels such as Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights.In a letter before her arrival, Charlotte Brontë described Brussels as her “promised land” and said that in half a year she hoped to acquire “a thorough familiarity with French … greatly improve in Italian, and even get a dash of German.” The sisters lived in the city centre but visited Koekelberg to see their Yorkshire friends Mary and Martha Taylor, who studied at the Château de Koekelberg school, a pricier establishment beyond the means of the Brontë sisters.When the Brontë sisters would meet the Taylors in a park 100 metres from the site of the new square, Koekelberg was a tranquil area, with tree-lined avenues and grand houses. Now it is an urban landscape better known for the vast art-deco Sacred Heart basilica that looms over the Brussels skyline.Martha died of cholera in 1842 and Charlotte would later visit her grave in a local Protestant cemetery during long, solitary walks. By 1843, Emily had left Brussels for good and Charlotte, lonely and depressed, struggled with her obsessive unrequited love for her married French teacher, Constantin Heger, later thinly disguised as the hot-tempered M. Paul Emanuel in Villette.Helen MacEwan, the founder of the Brussels Brontë Society and author of The Brontës in Brussels, said the naming of the square was great news. “It’s going to be a very important point in Koekelberg, so even though we haven’t got a street bang in the centre of Brussels, which is where they actually lived, I think we can all be absolutely delighted.”For now, the only trace of the Brontës’ stay in Brussels is a tiny plaque on the Bozar cultural centre, built close to the school – now long-since demolished – where Charlotte and Emily Brontë once lived and worked. The plaque was erected by the Brontë Society in 1979, but until now Brussels has never recognised the English novelists on city walls or street names."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e005430ca657e98e3ced8629c5929766e302bb9d/0_60_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f50e6a77ca46bcf9cdd053959b983f7","title":"china could prevent hongkongers moving to uk says dominic raab","story":"Beijing says Britain will ‘bear all consequences’ of helping fleeing Hongkongers China has said it will take countermeasures against the UK should it grant residency to Hongkongers fleeing a harsh new national security law, promising that the UK would “bear all consequences”.On Thursday, senior Chinese officials said the UK had no right to give residency to Hongkongers in response to Beijing forcing a sweeping anti-sedition law on the territory.“China strongly condemns this and reserves the right to take further measures. The British side will bear all the consequences,” the foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said at a regular press briefing in Beijing.Zhao’s comments came after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he would honour a promise to offer nearly 3 million residents of the former British colony, those with British national overseas status (BNO), the right to settle in the UK.Earlier on Thursday, China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, also said any move to grant residency to BNO holders would be a violation of agreements between the two countries.It was clear that “all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals, whether or not they are holders of the British dependent territories citizens passport or the British national (overseas) passport”, he said.“If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law.“We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures,” he said in a statement posted on the embassy’s website on Thursday. “The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of ‘supervision’ over Hong Kong.”Since the Hong Kong law went into effect late on Tuesday, at least 10 people have been arrested on national security related charges, including a 15-year old girl who waved a Hong Kong independence flag. On Wednesday, a total of almost 400 people were detained on other charges such as unlawful assembly, as thousands protested against the law.Human rights advocates and residents, fearing the security legislation will be used to arrest protesters and pro-democracy activists, have called on countries to allow Hongkongers to seek refuge in their countries.On Thursday, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said his country was working on a scheme to provide a safe haven to Hong Kong residents after China’s “very concerning” decision. Morrison said Australia was “prepared to step up and provide support”, although his cabinet was yet to finalise the details, including whether the scheme would include a pathway to permanent settlement.The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has admitted there is little Britain can do to “coercively force” China if it tries to block Hongkongers from coming to the UK.He told ITV’s Peston programme on Wednesday: “Ultimately if they follow through on something like that there would be little that we could do to coercively force them.”Raab continued: “There is an issue around freedom and human rights in Hong Kong, and there is an issue around China keeping its word on an international obligation it made to the United Kingdom back in 1984.“I wouldn’t want to be naive about this I think we need to be realistic. But I do think that China as a rising, leading member of the international community is sensitive to the reputational risk in all of this, but clearly not sufficiently that it hasn’t proceeded anyway ... There is diplomatic leverage, there are other ways that we can persuade China not to fully implement either the national security law or some of the reprisals you talk about.“But ultimately we need to be honest that we wouldn’t be able to force China to allow BNOs to come to the UK.”Raab said he was working with other countries in the region to discuss a lifeboat operation. He said: “We think the majority will probably hunker down in Hong Kong, and others would leave to other countries in the region.”The UK government believes the new security legislation passed by Beijing breaches the Sino-British joint declaration, which aimed to smooth the transition when the territory was handed back to China in 1997.Johnson has said he will honour a promise to change immigration rules to allow holders of BNO passports, as well as those eligible for the passport, to reside in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship.As of February, there were nearly 350,000 BNO passport holders, while the government estimated there were around 2.9 million BNOs living in Hong Kong.China has argued that a memorandum attached to the Sino-British joint declaration does not grant right of abode to those eligible for BNO status, but legal experts say the UK is not barred from extending their rights.Downing Street said those with BNO status would be eligible to travel to the UK immediately before the details of the scheme were finalised “in the coming weeks” and that they would not face salary thresholds.The security law in Hong Kong, enacted late after an opaque legislative process that took less than six weeks, criminalises a broad swathe of behaviours deemed as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.Critics say the law gives authorities sweeping new powers to crack down on dissent and a new level of Chinese control over the semi-autonomous territory.Liu was summoned to the Foreign Office on Wednesday, where the permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, told him the imposition of the new legislation on Hong Kong breached the Sino-British joint declaration.Following his visit, Liu tweeted: “After turbulent months in the latter half of last year, the national security law will bring the order＆stability to Hong Kong and get its economy back on track.”China views its actions as one of the last steps towards decolonisation, but an early test of its willingness to preserve the country’s freedoms will come in the autumn elections for the legislature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f616a57fa59d157df5bbfa56d8e3611411c64253/0_104_4731_2839/master/4731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9fbf513a7f58c2a5bfa3682b8ccbcde","title":"living in hong kong are you thinking about settling in the uk","story":"We would like to hear from those eligible for the right to settle in the UK on whether they are thinking of leaving Hong KongIn response to the UK prime minister offering nearly 3 million residents in Hong Kong the right to settle in the UK, China has said it would take “corresponding measures” to stop it from happening.We would like to hear from people as to whether they are thinking of relocating to the UK or any other country.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056..

This could delay results.Delaying A-levels is also under consideration but this may be more complicated because of the pressure to deliver results promptly so students can secure places in further and higher education.“We are also seeking views on whether such a change would be appropriate for the ASA-level exam timetable, and the impact of any delay in issuing results,” Ofqual said.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.The regulator has also drawn up proposals to reduce the amount taught in some subjects including GCSE history and geography, with more optional questions in some exams, so teachers have the freedom to choose topics to concentrate on, rather than being required to teach the entire curriculum.GCSE English, maths and science are seen as essential, however, and will be unchanged, and – under the current plans – there are no proposals to reduce what’s taught at A and AS-level in any subject.Ofqual is consulting on a number of other adaptations to give teachers more time to cover content and help relieve pressure on students. These include plans to allow GCSE students to observe practical science work rather than undertake it themselves and the removal of the compulsory computer programming project.Though pupils will generally face the same number of exams in each subject and exams are expected to be the same length, GCSE and A-level art and design students will be assessed on their portfolio alone and will not be required to complete a supervised task. In GCSE geography, fieldwork will not be assessed.Ofqual’s chief regulator, Sally Collier, said: “We have considered a wide range of options before coming forward with a set of proposals for next year’s GCSE, AS and A-level exams, which will help reduce the pressure on students and teachers, while allowing them to progress with valid qualifications which higher educational institutions and employers can trust.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, responded: “These plans appear to amount to little more than tinkering at the edges of next year’s exams, despite the massive disruption to learning caused by the coronavirus emergency.“We understand that it is difficult to scale back exams in a way that is fair to all pupils, but we fear the very minor changes in this consultation fail to recognise the enormous pressure on schools and their pupils to cover the large amount of content in these courses.”A consultation on Ofqual’s proposals is now under way and the regulator will announce its final decision on next year’s exams in August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35d944fb7da98f749d4009b9f8471b5f2c85467e/0_0_6448_3870/master/6448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199b93441b49e33bbd7e397fd43962ba","title":"uk to lift ban on non essential travel to up to 90 countries","story":"Change set to allow visits to nearly all EU countries, British overseas territories and Australia and New ZealandOverseas holidays and visits to up to 90 countries will be possible for Britons from Monday without the need to quarantine for 14 days on return.The Foreign Office is expected to lift its ban on non-essential travel to nearly all EU countries, British territories such as Bermuda and Gibraltar, and Australia and New Zealand.Turkey, a popular holiday destination, is also expected to be included in the list.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first.

People who fail to comply can be fined £1,000 in England.But as officials confirmed the number of countries to be included on the list, the UK government blamed the Scottish executive for holding up a final announcement.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said that the devolved administrations needed to “get on board” so they could get the policy announced.The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Scotland had not been adequately consulted and that the UK’s position had changed three times in the past 24 hours.Shapps told Scottish National party MPs in Westminster that they needed to lean on Sturgeon to change her mind.Responding to the SNP’s shadow transport spokesman, Gavin Newlands, he said: “I’m very keen to get the devolved administrations, including Scotland’s government, on board so we can get this thing announced.”He told Dr Philippa Whitford, the SNP MP for Central Ayrshire: “There is something the honourable member may be pleased that she can do, which is to ask the Scottish government to join with us in ensuring we have these air bridges in place nationwide as soon as possible.” All of the countries due to be included in the new travel list are likely to be on the government’s green list of low-risk nations for coronavirus, or from the amber list, which is medium risk.The difficulty travellers may now face is the inidual circumstances of countries they want to visit, such as those that have suspended flights from the UK, or closed their borders entirely.While Britons may be free to travel to Australia and New Zealand, both of those countries have currently closed their borders to almost all visitors.Greece, with which the government had been trying to establish a well-publicised air-bridge and which may have been a catalyst for the policy unravelling, has suspended all flights from the UK and Sweden until 15 July.The air-bridges policy, which the government announced last Friday, has been beset with uncertainty, including resistance from Sturgeon, who said Scotland had not been properly consulted and had to protect its low infection rate.The chief medical officer in Wales also suggested there should be no change to the 14-day quarantine rule for travellers into the UK.The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, was dispatched by government on Wednesday night to talk to his counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland about ending the blanket quarantine policy. This comes after a four-nations meeting with the cabinet minister Michael Gove on Monday.The European commission has previously warned that the UK government could face a legal challenge unless it considered air-bridge arrangements to all EU countries with similar infection rates.BA, easyJet and Ryanair are also set to bring a case in the high court seeking to overturn the government’s quarantine policy, which they claim is “irrational and disproportionate”.The ban on non-essential travel to countries on the government’s “red” list, such as the US, Russia and Brazil, will continue and anyone returning will have to continue with the 14-day quarantine measures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ae5e66432f009630410252b8832e92ab20d983/220_540_4451_2671/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6370f4df7abc85f6c8675282f233f7df","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"As lockdown restrictions ease we want to hear how you feel about itFrom this weekend, pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums, galleries and hairdressers in England will be allowed to reopen their doors.On Monday, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

It covers the week ending on Sunday 28 June. Here’s an extract from the summary.In an article for the  a paramedic working for NHS test and trace says the system is “a shambles” and that they are being paid to do nothing. Here’s an extract.For the past two weeks I have been able to log in, but I have sat in front of my computer with nothing to do. Initially, 400 shifts a day were advertised, varying between four and 12 hours. I booked between 20 and 30 four-hour slots. I’m supposed to have a line manager but I still don’t know who it is.My experience may be different from others but I don’t think I’m alone in experiencing technical problems and not having much work to do. This may be a good sign or it may suggest the system is not working.It is a scandal that this system has been described as a success, and an embarrassment that an influenza pandemic has been on top of the national risk register in terms of impact and likelihood for more than a decade, yet no real provision was put in place.NHS test and trace is too little, too late. It seems ridiculous that I, a trained healthcare professional, am being paid to do a job that anyone can do. I don’t understand why it is felt healthcare professionals are needed to read a script over the phone. It’s a waste of money.And here’s the full article.In Scotland one new coronavirus death has been reported today.In Wales another eight deaths have been recorded.And in Northern Ireland one further death has been recorded.Sir Keir Starmer has said that many more children could be back in school now if the government had shown more leadership on this issue. Commenting on the plan announced today for all pupils in England to return in September, he said in a clip for broadcasters:I want all children back in school as quickly as possible, and certainly by September, and I think that’s achievable. I actually think that many more children could be back now if there had been a better plan and better leadership ...We’ve been calling for a national plan. We’ll look at the details of this plan. What’s important now is confidence, confidence of teachers and of staff and of parents, and we need to build that confidence. Get everybody around the table, and let’s implement a plan that will actually work, because there’s a consensus we want all of our children back in September. That will only happen with leadership.Starmer’s comment follows repeated claims by Boris Johnson and other ministers, heard again at PMQs yesterday, that Labour does not support children going back. The claim is based on comments made by party figures earlier this year questioning whether it was safe for pupils to return. The Conservative attack line clearly stung, because Starmer has been stressing recently how firmly the party is now committed to pupils going back. Today he is effectively trying to outbid Johnson on this issue.The government’s lockdown that has closed schools, premises and companies while limiting free movement is the “most sweeping and far-reaching” restriction on fundamental rights since the second world war, the high court has been told. As Owen Bowcott reports, in a challenge to the legality of emergency legislation, the businessman Simon Dolan, whose Jota Aviation company has been delivering personal protective equipment (PPE) to the NHS, is testing the full extent of the powers under which England has been confined for the past 101 days.Here is Owen’s full story on the opening of the hearing.Here is a question from a reader in the comments.Andrew (or anyone else), when the Leicester local lockdown was announced on Monday govt said the legislation needed to enforce it would be enacted in the next day or two. It\u0027s now Thursday and I haven\u0027t seen anything, did I miss it? Or is the current local lockdown merely govt advice (and legally unenforceable)?This came up at the No 10 lobby briefing. The prime minister’s spokesman said that, although the Leicester lockdown was announced on Monday night, effectively it was only advisory for the first day or so because the legislation did not get signed until Wednesday. He said:And then as soon as the regulations come into place they are prevented by law from opening.But I think businesses did the right thing and they followed the guidance and request of the health secretary to close straight away.Earlier I posted the figures from the government’s latest test and trace bulletin showing that it is not yet meeting its target of getting all test results delivered within 24 hours. (See 11.50am.)The figures in the document cover “pillar 2” tests – those provided by commercial partners for members of the population at large. They do not cover testing in “pillar 1” – in NHS hospitals and Public Health England laboratories – because the data is not available for PHE laboratories.A “partial reopening” of the tourism sector in Wales is to take place over the next few weeks as long as rates of coronavirus continue to fall, the Welsh government has announced.The Labour-led government has asked visitors to enjoy their time in the country – but to respect local communities.Bars, restaurants and cafes with outdoor spaces are set to be allowed to re-open from 13 July.The final decision about outdoor re-opening will be made at the next Welsh government review on 9 July.Future decisions about indoor re-opening will be made later and depend on the success of outdoor opening.The “stay-local” instruction in Wales is due to lifted on Monday, which will allow outdoor attractions to re-open from then.The date from which owners of self-contained accommodation in Wales can accept bookings is being brought forward to 11 July from 13 July, to help with the pattern of Saturday-to-Saturday bookings.The minister for international relations and the Welsh language, Eluned Morgan, said: Tourism is a vital part of the Welsh economy at a national, regional and local level. I’d like to thank all our industry partners for working with us to carefully reopen the visitor economy.A successful, safe and phased return will give businesses, communities and visitors confidence to continue with the recovery of the visitor economy.We ask everyone who travels to and around Wales to enjoy their time here, but always to respect local communities. We are looking forward to welcoming visitors back to Wales – but we want everyone to visit Wales safely.Morgan defended the government’s cautious approach to bars, cafes and restaurants re-opening.She said: “If we open too quickly we will have to go back into lockdown. That is why we are taking this step-by-step controlled approach.”The two-metre social distancing in Wales will remain for pubs but Morgan said the government was working with the industry on additional measures for circumstances when the two-metre rule could not work.Additional measures may include a designated person being in charge of making sure premises were Covid-19 safe and taking names of customers so they could be traced if needed. NHS England has recorded a further 35 coronavirus hospital deaths in England. The full figures are here.For comparison, here are the equivalent daily figures announced by NHS England over the past fortnight.The Local Government Association says the extra support for English councils announced by Robert Jenrick earlier (see 9.43am) does not go far enough. Here is an extract from the statement from the LGA chairman, James Jamieson. He said:Councils continue to work all day and night to protect the most vulnerable from Covid-19, support local businesses and try and keep normal services running. This package offers some positive measures and recognises the pressures councils are facing, but more is desperately needed to fully address the severe financial challenges facing councils and our local services as a result.Here are the main points from the Downing Street lobby briefing.Returning to school in September will be mandatory. It’s always the case that headteachers do have some discretion. They know their pupils and their family situations.But, in general, children need to get back in to school and get back learning again.We do want people to be able to enjoy themselves but at the same time, now we have got coronavirus under control we need to keep it under control.The guidance is there, we want people to follow it and then we can make more progress together in the fight against coronavirus.The PM has said that it is important that people don’t overdo it.Since 11 June, an operational data dashboard has been made available for all local authorities to give them a clear picture in their local areas, and this included the counts of total tests, total positive and a rolling average for pillar two.Last week we started securely sharing postcode-level and inidual case testing data with all local authorities - that’s available to them at any time.I think there has been an issue with councils not returning data agreements to Public Health England - I think that is the case with one of the councils which has featured in the media this morning, Rochdale ...All of the data made available has been distributed at the highest level that information governance rules will allow. Local authorities receive both upper and lower-tier local authority level data regularly, and identifiable data when there is an outbreak.Making more detailed data widely available does run the risk of revealing patient identifiable information, therefore it is only shared with local authorities who have data sharing agreements in place to protect the confidentiality of the data.Boris Johnson has used an interview with the Evening Standard to signal that the furlough scheme will not be extended beyond October. He has been under pressure to extend it, particularly for workers in sectors like the performing arts, where there is as yet no prospect of theatres and other venues being able to return to normal. But Johnson said the scheme had to end eventually. He told the paper:I’ve got to be very, very blunt with you. We’ve spent £120bn supporting people, it’s a huge commitment and we have put our arms around people ... But I think people need to recognise that the particular restrictions that furlough places on you are not, in the long-term, healthy either for the economy or for you as an employee ...You are keeping people in suspended animation ... I am being absolutely frank with you, we are pushing it out until October, but in the end you have got to get the economy moving.The OBR estimates that the scheme will have cost the government £60bn by October.The Association of School and College Leaders has said that trying to follow the guidance set out for schools in England for September will be “mind-boggling”. In a statement Geoff Barton, the ASCL general secretary, said “a sense of reality” was needed. Headteachers would do their best, he said. But, echoing what the NAHT union said (see 10.19am), Barton said ministers should develop a “plan B” too. He said:It will be immediately apparent to anyone reading this guidance that it is enormously challenging to implement. The logistics of keeping apart many different ‘bubbles’ of children in a full school, including whole-year groups comprising hundreds of pupils, is mind boggling ... There just needs to be a sense of reality about what is possible. School leaders will do their best, as they always do, and ASCL will support them all the way, but this is not going to be perfect. It will be hard for everyone concerned to implement and become accustomed to difficult and complicated systems, and it will not work smoothly all the time. And while we share the ambition of bringing all pupils back to school in the autumn, we would urge the government to have in place a national plan B in the event that we arrive at September and it becomes clear that a full return is just too risky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a778ba9549fc89da2ce306fabfd381d5fcfa42/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d2b4c30d7bdcd326b792f993bb58874","title":"coronavirus vaccine tracker how close are we to a vaccine","story":"More than 140 teams of researchers are racing to develop a safe and effective coronavirus vaccineResearchers around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, with more than 140 candidate vaccines now tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO).Vaccines normally require years of testing and additional time to produce at scale, but scientists are hoping to develop a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to 18 months.Vaccines mimic the virus - or part of the virus - they protect against, stimulating the immune system to develop antibodies. They must follow higher safety standards than other drugs because they are given to millions of healthy people.In the pre-clinical stage of testing, researchers give the vaccine to animals to see if it triggers an immune response. In phase 1 of clinical testing, the vaccine is given to a small group of people to determine whether it is safe and to learn more about the immune response it provokes. In phase 2, the vaccine is given to hundreds of people so scientists can learn more about its safety and correct dosage.

Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294650.1593700963!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"face coverings to become mandatory on ni public transport","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA man is pictured wearing a facemask on a Dart in Dublin.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins.Face coverings will become mandatory on public transport in Northern Ireland from Friday week, Minister of Infrastructure Nichola Mallon has announced.The SDLP Minister said the measure is part of the gradual easing of the lockdown in Northern Ireland and designed to support efforts to reduce transmission of Covid-19. She made the announcement on a day when the North’s Department of Health reported one more Covid-19 death, bringing the total to 552. It also reported seven additonal cases of the virus, taking the total to 5,768. A total of 113,283 people have been tested for the disease in Northern Ireland to date.Ms Mallon said that from July 10th masks will be compulsory for passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland. Face coverings also will be required in public transport stations.ExemptionsThere will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of 13. Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport. The tour coach and taxi industry will be consulted to explore whether the mask requirement should be extended to their vehicles.Ms Mallon said that a face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth, but does not have to be a surgical face mask.She said that while face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly.“By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff,” she said. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294692.1593703578!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 fianna f%C3%A1il s john lahart is first td to wear face mask in d%C3%A1il chamber","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil TD John Lahart on Thursday became the first TD to wear a mask in the Dáil chamber. Image: Oireachtas TV. Fianna Fáil TD John Lahart on Thursday became the first TD to wear a face mask in the Dáil chamber.The Dublin South West deputy wore a black mask during a meeting of the Dáil’s Covid-19 committee, which was examining the impact of the pandemic on education and plans for chidren to return to school in the autumn. Public representatives have been asked to lead by example during the pandemic and wear face coverings to supress the possible spread of the disease, but few in Leinster House have done so.  Mr Lahart wore the mask in the chamber while a limited number of people were present and social distancing measures were in use.Under phase three of the official roadmap to lift the Covid-19 restrictions, which came into effect on Monday, it is “strongly advised” that face coverings are worn on public transport, in enclosed spaces and in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain.Public debateAfter a lengthy public debate about how effective wearing masks is, the Government last month recommended their use.Despite the roll-out of a public information campaign, the numbers wearing face masks has been relatively low, including on public transport, where traffic numbers increased substantially on Monday when most businesses were cleared to reopen.Detailed regulations providing for mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport are being drawn up by the Department of Health and the Department of Transport but are expected to take at least another week to complete."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Beijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289353.1593169576!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish woman named first female head of top eu medicines agency","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmer Cooke moves to the EMA from a role as director of the WHO’s regulation and prequalification department, which she held since 2016Emer Cooke has been named executive director of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), becoming the first woman to lead the powerful regulatory body. The appointment comes at a crucial time for the agency, as it may take up an increasing role in securing supplies of medicines and streamlining research into new drugs as the European Union bids for increased powers in health to avoid pharmaceutical shortages and improve its future pandemic response.  “Emer has proven herself to be a leader in her field and we are delighted she has been nominated to take up this role at such an important time for healthcare and the EMA in light of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Minister for Health Simon Harris said following the appointment. Ms Cooke’s appointment comes at a time when a number of Irish figures hold or are in the running for top positions in major global bodies.\u0026nbsp  The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) response to the coronavirus pandemic has been led by Dr Mike Ryan, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe this week put his name forward for the presidency of the powerful Eurogroup, while Ireland’s European Commissioner Phil Hogan has floated himself as a candidate to take over the leadership of the World Trade Organisation. Ms Cooke moves to the EMA from a role as director of the WHO’s regulation and prequalification department, which she held since 2016, and will take over from after the term of current executive director Guido Rasi ends on November 15th. She was nominated for the post by the EMA’s management board, and will formally be appointed after giving a statement to the European Parliament’s Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on July 13th. Ms Cooke began her career in the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland and holds a degree in pharmacy and masters degrees in science and business administration from Trinity College Dublin.

Photograph: Stephanie Lecocq  EPAThe latest round of talks between Britain and the European Union about their future relationship have ended a day early with both sides saying significant differences remain. Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost said the face to face talks in Brussels had been useful and that the negotiating teams will meet again next week in London as planned.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We have completed our discussion of the full range of issues in the negotiation in just over three days.\u0026nbspOur talks were face to face for the first time since March and this has given extra depth and flexibility to our discussions.\u0026nbspThe negotiations have been comprehensive and useful.\u0026nbspBut they have also underlined the significant differences that still remain between us on a number of important issues.\u0026nbspWe remain committed to working hard to find an early understanding on the principles underlying an agreement out of the intensified talks process during July,” he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAt a video conference last month, Boris Johnson agreed with the presidents of the European institutions to step up the pace of talks during the summer and the two sides will meet every week in July and into next month. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier suggested on Thursday that they had not succeeded this week in injecting “new dynamics” into the talks.Trajectory\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement. However, after four days of discussions, serious ergences remain. The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Mr Barnier said after the talks ended on Thursday that there could be no deal on an economic partnership without level playing field guarantees, a “balanced, sustainable and long-term” agreement on fisheries and an overarching institutional framework and effective dispute resolution mechanisms. The EU last month indicated that it was willing to compromise on the issues of fisheries and level playing field commitments on state aid and Mr Barnier said his negotiators had “engaged constructively” with Britain’s demands.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The EU expects, in turn, its positions to be better understood and respected in order to reach an agreement. We need an equivalent engagement by the United Kingdom. We continue to believe that an agreement is possible and in everyone’s interest,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293753.1593626392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"world look away now these are dark days for the united states","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tParticipants in a Black Lives Matter protest  in  Trafalgar Square, London. ‘The US is the only nation today whose domestic failings could set off vast protests in other continents.’ Photograph: Niklas HallenEPAAt its midpoint, 2020 is turning out to be one of the darkest years in the peacetime history of the US. It has also affirmed the nation’s global primacy beyond any doubt. Fear not for your columnist’s grip on logical reasoning, at least any more than usual. These contrary claims are reconcilable.The first comes from a mere glance at the facts. The US accounts for a quarter of the world’s recorded deaths from Covid-19. Its people are ignominiously barred from entry to the EU and other allied territories. Unemployment is at its highest rate for a human lifetime. The killing of George Floyd has exposed racial inequities and highlighted once more a homicide rate that marks America out among rich countries.Even if the Depression was more acutely harrowing, there was no pandemic and, from 1933, people had Franklin Roosevelt to lead them, not a thrown, lost-looking Donald Trump. On that point, with the logistical test of a presidential election still ahead, the year has ample room to get worse.Compounding these traumas is intense scrutiny from the rest of the world. And so to the second claim. The US is the only nation today whose domestic failings could set off vast protests in other continents.For all its heft, China does not draw young Europeans to the streets on behalf of Uighurs or the cause of democracy in Hong Kong. At least not in such awesome numbers. It took the Floyd killing at the hands of police to do that. And, while the US has botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic, other countries with dismal records (namely Britain) escape without the same volume or tenor of foreign coverage.Such exposure was the price America once paid for its overwhelming superiority in economic scale and military potential. It was a tax on world leadership and, as such, eminently affordable. With China’s gains in both gross domestic product and armaments, however, even this consolation no longer applies.The US, then, finds itself in the worst of all possible worlds. Its external power and internal cohesion are manifestly in decline. Its psychic hold on the rest of humanity is not. The result is a level of scrutiny that no other nation, not even the other superpower, has to experience – or, perhaps, could withstand. The tighter the inspection, the more numerous the revealed flaws, and the more compromised is America’s ability to command global deference.ObsessionThe whole process is viciously circular. What is a boon for a Washington correspondent – everyone, everywhere has an opinion on the US – can be a bane for Americans themselves.As the tussle develops, China’s obvious advantages over the US include a four-times-larger population and a one-party system’s ability to plan long-term. But a less discussed one is the world’s lower level of obsession with it, for now. This is more often framed as a liability: a lack of soft power, of cultural magnetism, compared with the land of Netflix and all-conquering pop stars. But the corollary is greater freedom from outside invigilation.A discreet rise is what China is said to have achieved over recent decades. The US is condemned to the exact opposite: to wane in public, like an actor who no longer commands the plum roles but remains hounded by paparazzi. Its crimes and mistakes are still aired like no other nation’s.It was natural that America held the world rapt when that world was unipolar. That it continues to do so in 2020 needs some explaining. One reason is the country’s relative openness to media coverage. Another, reinforcing the first, is the English language: it is easier for the average European (or Australian or Nigerian) to follow US public life than China’s.Yet a third reason, it has to be said, is America’s self-image as a standard bearer for the species. Claim city-on-a-hill status, and cynics will comb the city for blemishes and signs of subsidence, even if they do so with tasteless relish or with great hypocrisy. Trump, a raw nationalist, tends to avoid talk of the US as a moral experiment on behalf of mankind. His successors should retain this if no other feature of his presidency.This week, the UK government named some policies after Roosevelt’s New Deal, a now almost 90-year-old programme of disputed effectiveness undertaken in different circumstances in a different continent. The way the US continues to serve as a reference point is impressive. It is a vestigial mark of its time as a truly unchallenged power. But it comes at the cost of painful exposure.The world is moving on from American hegemony. It is not moving on from the American spectacle. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed areas could face local coronavirus lockdowns within","story":"The new PHE figures show Barnsley has the third highest rate per 100,000 population with 54.7 cases, followed by Rochdale (53.6) and Bedford (42). Former Government scientific adviser Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said these places were clearly of concern.  Search for your area in the table below to see the difference between previously published case counts and revisions including Pillar 2 dataAs it is, we\u0027re having to spread our resources over a wide area rather than targeting them effectively.

Such a move should be made in exceptional circumstances, following discussions with parents, and the full curriculum should be restored no later than the summer term.Pupils in their first year of secondary school may need to be re-taught the Year Six syllabus for English and maths, and GCSE pupils may be asked to drop subjects so they can concentrate on getting good grades in English and maths.Pupils should be assessed regularly through quizzes and close scrutiny of their work to make sure they are not falling behind. The guidance stresses that, as an overriding approach, schools should teach a broad and ambitious curriculum which includes a wide range of subjects.Social distancing will not be applied in schools at all times, and pupils will instead be grouped into bubbles to limit the risk of transmission between class or year groups.The bubbles will either be a class or an entire year group who have their lessons, breaks and lunchtime together. In primary school, class bubbles will be the norm, whereas in secondary school bubbles will be expanded to include entire year groups.This approach means that, if a pupil tests positive for coronavirus, it is easier for a school to identify which of their classmates also need to self-isolate.Older children should be encouraged to keep their distance from their peers where they can, but the guidance recognises that this is not possible for younger pupils.Teachers should stay at the front of the class and avoid close face-to-face contact within one metre of pupils.Schools should adapt classrooms to give pupils as much space as possible, such as removing unnecessary furniture.Windows should be kept open where possible, and desks should be set out with pupils sitting side by side, facing the front of the class, rather than sitting face-to-face with their peers.Year groups should be kept apart, meaning that assemblies or any other large gatherings, such as communal prayer, are banned.School choirs and ensembles are also banned, as the guidance warns that there is an additional risk of infection where pupils are singing, chanting, playing wind or brass instruments or shouting. These activities could take place with special controls in place, such as limiting group sizes to 15 pupils and ensuring they stand back-to-back or side-to-side. It should be outdoors where possible, with extended social distancing.Schools should conduct sports lessons outside where possible, and if this is not possible then a large indoor space should be used. Children should do sports lessons within their bubbles, and equipment must be thoroughly cleaned after being used by each year group.Schools should stagger break times and lunchtimes where they can, to make sure that each bubble of students stays apart from other bubbles as much as possible. Outdoor playground equipment should be cleaned more often.School kitchens should be fully open from the start of term, but must comply with the Government\u0027s Covid-19 guidance for food businesses. Dining room surfaces should be cleaned between use by different bubbles. All the normal legal requirements will apply for schools to provide lunch for those who want it, as well as those eligible for free school meals.Schools should stagger the start and end of the day to alleviate congestion and to prevent different year groups or classes from mixing with one another.The school day does not need to be extended to accommodate this, but break times or free periods could be moved around to make it work. The start and end of a school day should not coincide with rush hour, and parents must be told not to congregate at the gate or come on to the premises unless they have an appointment.Schools need to make it clear to pupils and staff that any face masks they wore while travelling to school must be removed on arrival.Schools should update their behaviour policies to include sanctions for breaching the new hygiene or bubble regimes, and the new rules must be clearly explained to pupils and their parents.Teachers are told to prepare for an increase in bad behaviour among children who may have suffered from adversity, trauma and a lack of routine during lockdown.Pupils may struggle to re-engage with learning, and teachers will need to work hard to reintegrate them into school life. Schools can discipline unruly children, but should only expel them as a last resort.The guidance reminds teachers that off-rolling is never acceptable and that parents should not be pressured into home-schooling their child.Pupils should walk or cycle to school where possible and avoid using public transport, particularly at peak times such as rush hour.Schools could set up walking buses, where a teacher accompanies a group of children walking to or from school. Where pupils are using dedicated school transport, they do not need to socially distance from one another, but pupils should remain in their bubbles where they can. If they are mixing with other bubbles, they should wear face masks. Children should use hand sanitiser when getting on and off a school bus, while vehicles should be regularly cleaned.Children and staff should wash their hands immediately when they arrive at school, as well as regularly throughout the day.The mantra of catch it, bin it, kill it should be drilled into all pupils, meaning anyone who coughs or sneezes should use a disposable tissue and then throw it away. Schools need to make sure there are enough tissues and bins in the school for pupils to follow this directive.Frequently-touched surfaces should be cleaned using detergents and bleach, and the whole school premises should be regularly cleaned.Face masks are generally not necessary in schools as they inhibit communication, and personal protective equipment (PPE) is only necessary if a child develops coronavirus symptoms while at school and a teacher is unable to stay two metres away while waiting for them to be picked up by their parents.Teachers have been told to make sure that remote learning is fully integrated into their lesson plans since it may need to be an essential component of children\u0027s learning if there is a local lockdown and a school is closed down.Schools must have contingency plans in place for remote learning by the end of September at the latest. This should include high quality online resources for children and teaching videos, as well as printed worksheets and textbooks for those who do not have computers.Children who are leaning at home must be set meaningful and ambitious work in different subjects every day, and this must be equivalent in standard to what they would have learnt during a normal school day.Remote learning plans should also be in place for any students who are self-isolating, as well as pupils who are shielding.Read more: Home-schooling tips and secrets for parentsAll league tables are suspended for the next academic year. GCSEs and A-levels will take place in summer 2021, but with some adaptations, including those which will free up teaching time.The exam regulator, Ofqual, will publish detailed proposals on this in the coming weeks. Schools will also be expected to put on a full series of GCSE and A-level exams this autumn for pupils wishing to appeal against the predicted grades they are given this summer.  All statutory tests, including the phonics screening check, Year Four times tables tests and Year Six Sats, will take place next academic year as normal.If a school has two or more confirmed cases of coronavirus within two weeks, or an overall rise in sickness or absence where coronavirus is suspected as a cause, this will be seen as a possible outbreak. In such a case, the school must liaise with their local health protection team who will advise on whether further action is needed.The health protection team may recommend that a number of other pupils stay at home and self-isolate as a precaution. This could include an entire year group or even all pupils in the whole school.School closures will not generally be necessary and should not be implemented unless on the advice of health experts. If an outbreak in a school is declared, a mobile testing unit may be sent to the school so that any pupils or staff can be tested. Testing will initially focus on the ill pupil\u0027s class, followed by their year group and, if necessary, the entire school.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"charts countries covid 19 showing no sign slowing","story":"More than 10m cases of Covid-19 have now been reported across the world, and case are back on the rise in regions which face the prospect of renewed local lockdowns.Over the past week, the number of new cases reported each day has been above 150,000, and 60 per cent of all cases have been reported in the last month.Cases are rising in multiple American states, and 300,000 people in Melbourne have been issued stay at home orders after a resurgence of the virus.While cases are in decline across much of Europe, the virus\u0027 grip on countries across the world is tightening and showing no signs of slowing down.According to the latest data, countries where Covid-19 cases are on the rise include the United States, South Africa, Columbia and Palestine.The rate of new cases in South Africa is approaching the same level as the United States, with 114 cases per million people, on average, in the week to June 1.Across the USA the average rate of daily new cases has now reached 131 per million - surpassing its previous peak of 96.In Palestine, the rate of new daily cases has doubled in little more than a week, from 19 per million to 42 per million. “Flare-ups are to be expected as countries start to lift restrictions,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation on Wednesday.“But countries that have the systems in place to apply a comprehensive approach should be able to contain these flare-ups locally and avoid reintroducing widespread restrictions.“However, we are concerned that some countries have not used all the tools at their disposal and have taken a fragmented approach.“But one of the lessons of the pandemic is that no matter what situation a country is in, it can be turned around. It’s never too late.”The pandemic is continuing to rise across the Americas and Asia, with worrying trends emerging in Africa.North America accounted for 30 per cent of all new Covid-19 cases on June 30, with 25 per cent in South America and 27 per cent in Asia.After being declared the epicentre of the virus in March, cases have trailed off in Europe, which now accounts for fewer than one in ten new cases across the globe. The second wave emerging in the US is not being driven by outbreaks in all of the nation\u0027s 50 states, however.Some - most notably New York - have seen infections drop off compared to the huge peaks of March and April.The state was seeing over 10,000 new cases per day at the pandemic\u0027s peak, but is now down to 600 daily infections.Instead Florida, Texas and California are among a new group of states facing the brunt of the pandemic, as over a quarter of states still face a week-on-week increase in the number of new Covid-19 infections.These three states alone accounted for nearly half of the US\u0027s quarter of a million cases confirmed last week.Renewed infections has forced several governors to back out of an initial easing of lockdown measures.Texas governor Greg Abbott, who previously ordered bars in the state to reopen, warned on Monday that America\u0027s experience of the global pandemic was taking a \u0027very swift and very dangerous turn.A total of 39 states have seen week on week rises in new daily cases.Across the Pacific, Australian health officials are grappling with a surge in cases in Melbourne, with authorities issuing stay at home orders in 36 suburbs across ten postcodes in the city today.Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews has blamed extended family gatherings and violations of hotel quarantines for the region\u0027s alarming spike in new infections, which totaled over 250 last week.This contrasts with the situation in Australia\u0027s other provinces, including New South Wales, home of Sydney, which has seen its previously dramatic infection rate level off.  The province saw just 33 new cases last week, compared to around 1,122 in the last week of March, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china vows corresponding measures uk enacts hong kong citizenship","story":"China promised Thursday to take countermeasures against Britain if it presses ahead with plans to extend citizenship rights to Hong Kongers after Beijing imposed a sweeping security law on the restless financial hub.Beijing has faced a groundswell of criticism from primarily Western nations over its decision to impose a new law outlawing acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces.Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas and arrested more than 300 people as protesters took to the streets in defiance of the sweeping security legislation introduced by China to snuff out dissent.Early in the morning of July 2, Hong Kong police arrested a 24-year-old man at the city\u0027s airport on suspicion of attacking and wounding an officer during protests against a new national security law Beijing imposed on the financial hub.On Wednesday, police posted pictures on Twitter of an officer with a bleeding arm saying he was stabbed by rioters holding sharp objects. The suspects fled while bystanders offered no help, police said.A police spokesman told Reuters the arrested man was surnamed Wong but could not confirm if he was leaving Hong Kong or working at the airport.Local newspaper Apple Daily, citing unnamed sources, said the suspect was onboard a Cathay Pacific flight to London due to depart just before midnight.A witness said around 10 minutes before take-off, three police vehicles drove towards No 64 gate, outside the Cathay Pacific plane and around 10 riot police ran up the bridge to the aircraft.Cathay Pacific did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Adding to concerns of Beijing\u0027s crackdown, Hong Kong\u0027s influential Bar Association published a new legal analysis warning that the wording of the law - which was kept secret until Tuesday - undermines the city\u0027s independent judiciary and stifles freedoms.Britain has said the law breaches China\u0027s pre-handover One Country, Two Systems promise to grant residents key liberties - as well as judicial and legislative autonomy - until 2047.It has responded by announcing plans to allow millions of Hong Kongers with British National Overseas status to relocate with their families and eventually apply for citizenship.We will live up to our promises to them, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told parliament.That move has infuriated Beijing, which says Britain promised not to grant full citizenship rights to Hongkongers ahead of the 1997 handover.If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations, China\u0027s embassy in London said Thursday.We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures, it added.Australian leader Scott Morrison said he was very actively considering offering Hong Kongers safe haven.Taiwan has opened an office to help Hongkongers wanting to flee, while a proposed bill in the United States offering sanctuary to city residents has received widespread bipartisan support.Beijing says the law is needed to quell seething pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and restore order after a year of political unrest.But critics fear it will usher in a new era of political repression given similar laws are routinely used to crush dissent on the Chinese mainland.The law has sent fear coursing through the city and rattled the legal community in a business hub that has built its reputation on the independence and reliability of its courts.On July 1, the US House of Representatives agreed unanimously to seek tough sanctions on Chinese officials and Hong Kong police. The House quickly passed the act that had already passed the Senate the week prior.Due to technical changes, the Senate will need to vote again and a senator said it could happen today.The Chinese regime just thinks that they can act with impunity and repressing the spirit of democracy, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the House passage.If we refuse to speak out on human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights any place in the world, said Washington\u0027s top elected Democrat, long a vocal proponent of human rights in China.President Donald Trump has not said if he will sign the bill but one of his allies briefly held up the Senate version, seeking changes.Trump publicly hesitated last year before signing another rights bill on Hong Kong which also lays out sanctions against Chinese officials for infringing on the city\u0027s autonomy.Unlike the previous act, the new legislation would make sanctions mandatory, limiting Trump\u0027s ability to waive them. In a crucial pressure point, it would also slap sanctions on banks that conduct transactions with violators.Beijing said Thursday it deplores and firmly opposes the US bill, adding that Hong Kong issues are part of China\u0027s internal affairs.We urge the US to grasp the reality of the situation, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and implementing the negative bill, otherwise we will take strong countermeasures, said foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dog year isnt seven human years scientists find pets might older","story":"A commonly held belief among dog owners is that if they want to know how old their pet is, they simply have to times its age by seven.Then, it can be decided whether man\u0027s best friend is acting up because it is a naughty teenager - or simply due to poor training.However, new research has found that this method is not based on science, and our pooches may be far \u0027older\u0027 than previously believed.As people, and animals, age, the number and placement of methyl groups in the genome change. By mapping these, scientists can tell the age of an organism.The researchers from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine used blood samples from 105 Labrador retrievers to accurately work out how quickly the breed ages. The study, published in Cell Systems, found the comparison is not a 1:7 ratio over time. Especially when dogs are young, they age rapidly compared to humans. A one-year-old dog is similar to a 30-year-old human. A four-year-old dog is similar to a 52-year-old human. Then by seven years old, dog aging slows, and a 12-year-old dog is 70 in human years.This makes sense when you think about it - after all, a nine-month-old dog can have puppies, so we already knew that the 1:7 ratio wasn\u0027t an accurate measure of age, said senior author Dr Trey Ideker, professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine.Scientists say this new comparison between dog ageing and human could be helpful for vets, so they can work out whether illnesses in dogs are age-related. The formula provides a new epigenetic clock, a method for determining the age of a cell, tissue or organism based on a readout of its epigenetics, which are chemical modifications like methylation, which influence which genes are off or on without altering the inherited genetic code.Previous studies have found epigenetic clocks for humans, but these don\u0027t translate to other species and may not even be the same for other humans.One limitation of this clock is they only used blood from Labradors, and different breeds are known to live for different amounts of time.  Dr Ideker plans to test more breeds, but said that since it\u0027s accurate for humans and mice as well as Labrador retrievers, he predicts the clock will apply to all dog breeds.I have a six-year-old dog -- she still runs with me, but I\u0027m now realising that she\u0027s not as \u0027young\u0027 as I thought she was, Dr Ideker added.He said dogs are interesting to study because they live so closely with us, perhaps more than any other animal, so a dog\u0027s environmental and chemical exposures are very similar to humans, and they receive nearly the same levels of health care.The research could be useful for humans, not just their pets. The scientists believe the epigenetic clock could be used to test anti-ageing treatments, to see if they had made any difference to the methylation patterns in the genome and therefore altered the \u0027age\u0027 of human cells.There are a lot of anti-ageing products out there these days - with wildly varying degrees of scientific support, Dr Ideker said,  But how do you know if a product will truly extend your life without waiting 40 years or so? What if you could instead measure your age-associated methylation patterns before, during and after the intervention to see if it\u0027s doing anything?More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ofqual pares gcse subjects curricula ahead 2021exams","story":"Next summer’s GCSEs will be slimmed down with science experiments stopped, oral language exams cancelled and geography field trips scrapped, under plans revealed on Thursday.Ofqual, the exams watchdog, has unveiled its proposals on how exams in 2021 will be altered, after students faced months of school closures during lockdown.The watchdog’s plans include a scaled-back history GCSE exam, where pupils are required to study up to 15 per cent less of their course, and performance times will be halved in music exams.The regulator has proposed delaying all exams until the start of June, meaning they would likely run into July and results days, usually in mid-August, may have to be pushed back. Usually all GCSEs, AS and A-levels are required to take place in May and June.A series of sweeping changes to GCSEs proposed by the watchdog include:It comes as the Government has released guidance on reopening schools in England to all pupils from September, which says schools will be expected to deliver their full curriculum ahead of exams in 2021.But in exceptional circumstances, Year 11 pupils could drop a GCSE subject so they can concentrate on getting good grades in English and maths.Headteachers criticised Ofqual\u0027s plans for 2021 exams, claiming they amount to little more than tinkering at the edges.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that postponing exams until the start of June only adds up to a few weeks more learning time to compensate for a shutdown which has lasted for four months.He added: The young people who will take these exams have lost a huge chunk of face-to-face teaching time, and there is likely to be more disruption next academic year, with the possibility of localised full or partial closures in response to coronavirus outbreaks, and students who have to self-isolate.We understand that it is difficult to scale back exams in a way that is fair to all pupils, but we fear the very minor changes in this consultation fail to recognise the enormous pressure on schools and their pupils to cover the large amount of content in these courses.Sally Collier, chief regulator of Ofqual, said that the watchdog considered a wide range of options before putting forward its proposals for exams next year.She said their proposals will help reduce the pressure on students and teachers, while allowing them to progress with valid qualifications which higher educational institutions and employers can trust.Gavin Williamson, the Secretary of State for Education said: The range of measures proposed by Ofqual, including the possible short delay to the exam timetable and subject-specific changes to reduce pressure on teaching time, will further ensure those young people taking exams next year have the same opportunities to progress as the students before them.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"raffles ballot stuffing brute forcehow vote keep putin power","story":"Voting at a playground and out of the boot of a car, over the last week the Kremlin has employed myriad ways to hold a nationwide vote allowing Vladimir Putin to stay in power in 2036.Mr Putin, who has ruled Russia for 20 years, would have been forced to step down when his current term in office ends in 2024.However, constitutional changes that he floated earlier this year re-set the clock on term limits for the sitting president.Voting on the amendments is not covered by Russia’s strict, if not always enforceable election laws, so the Kremlin came up with new, lax rules.Worried about delaying the vote, election authorities allowed the voting to be held in the space of a week and in outdoor settings.Social media was flooded with photos and videos of election officials, all  in full hospital-style PPE, leisurely handing out the ballots at playgrounds, on tree stumps, next to a drinking party on a bench and even out of the boot of a car. So many pictures of people using tree stumps were posted that they became a meme. Many election observers and journalists don’t appear to have quite as much fun.Journalist David Frenkel\u0027s arm was broken by a police officer after he arrived at a polling station to check reports of vote-rigging.The polling station’s chairman later insisted that the man fell down and injured himself.In the city of Saratov on the Volga River, election observers saw two neat piles of ballot papers sitting on top of scattered papers in a transparent box at a local polling station, prompting accusations of ballot stuffing. Desperate for a high turnout, which potentially makes it easier to rig the results, regional authorities lured voters to polling stations with the promises of raffles and prizes.The oil-rich Yamal-Nenetsk district was offering smartphones and laptops to lucky winners.In Siberia’s city of Omsk, an election commission member happened to win an apartment. The retail union that organised the raffle explained to the Tass news agency that the woman was simply lucky.In Moscow, where voters are entered the Million of Prizes raffle, Mr Putin is reported to have received his free badge, wrist-band, pen, pocket calendar and a scratch card for the lottery.Early results were also released, contrary to usual rules, infuriating some officials. Ella Pamfilova, Central Election Commission chief, earlier this week criticised Russian state-owned pollster for publishing exit poll results before the voting was over, but lamented the lack of legal means to stop that.Two days later, Ms Pamfilova gave the green light to releasing early voting results from the Far East, more than five hours before the voting would end in Russia’s west.Many Kremlin critics have said that the devil-may-care attitudes of election officials have left ample room for skewing the results in Mr Putin’s favour.At-home voting was not restricted, and was cited a major risk for multiple voting.Mikhail Baturin, a member of a local election commission in Moscow, raised the alarm on the final election day on Wednesday after he saw that at least 30 out of 430 at-home voters marked down in the log book as those who voted at the polling station.“There are no procedures, and no one even bothered to follow any rules,” Mr Baturin, who managed to get the commission to cancel the at-home votes, told The  “This is really funny,” he said, when asked about the official results.The ballot count at his precinct showed a 52 percent vote against Mr Putin’s amendments.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us customs officials seize products made human hair uighurs","story":"Federal authorities in New York on Wednesday seized a shipment of weaves and other beauty accessories suspected to be made out of human hair taken from people locked inside a Chinese internment camp.US Customs and Border Protection officials told The Associated Press that 13 tons (11.8 metric tonnes) of hair products worth an estimated $800,000 were in the shipment.The production of these goods constitutes a very serious human rights violation, and the detention order is intended to send a clear and direct message to all entities seeking to do business with the United States that illicit and inhumane practices will not be tolerated in US supply chains, said Brenda Smith, executive assistant commissioner of CBP\u0027s Office of Trade.This is the second time this year that CBP has slapped one of its rare detention orders on shipments of hair weaves from China, based on suspicions that people making them face human rights abuses.The orders are used to hold shipping containers at the US ports of entry until the agency can investigate claims of wrongdoing.Rushan Abbas, a Uighur American activist whose sister, a medical doctor, went missing in China almost two years ago and is believed to be locked in a detention camp, said women who use hair weaves should think about who might be making them.This is so heartbreaking for us, she said. I want people to think about the slavery people are experiencing today. My sister is sitting somewhere being forced to make what, hair pieces?Exporters of both shipments are in China\u0027s far west Xinjiang region, where, over the past four years, the government has detained an estimated 1 million or more ethnic Turkic minorities.The ethnic minorities are held in internment camps and prisons where they are subjected to ideological discipline, forced to denounce their religion and language and physically abused.China has long suspected the Uighurs, who are mostly Muslim, of harboring separatist tendencies because of their distinct culture, language and religion.Reports by the AP and other news organisations have repeatedly found that people inside the internment camps and prisons, which activists call black factories, are making sportswear and other apparel for popular US brands.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/24/16/coronavirus-lockdown-internet-use.jpg","title":"coronavirus internet use uk lockdown facebook google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Lockdown\u0026nbspmay leave a lasting digital legacy,\u0027 says Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and researchPeople in the UK have been spending record amounts of time on the internet during the coronavirus lockdown, new data has revealed.In April 2020, UK adults spent longer than four hours online each day – more than a quarter of their waking life.It marks an increase of more than half an hour since January and means people now spend substantially more time online than watching television or listening to the radio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures were revealed in Ofcom’s Online Nation report, which detailed the habits and trends of internet users between November 2019 and April 2020.People aged 18 to 24 were the most heavy users, clocking an average of more than five hours spent online per day.A large portion of the study focussed on internet habits in 2019, which revealed that technology giants now control an even greater share of internet traffic.The research by the regulator showed that more than a third of time spent online was spent on sites owned by either Facebook or Google.The shift towards platforms like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger appears to have been accelerated during lockdown, with nearly half of all adults using the messaging apps to make video calls at least once a week.Data shows Trump is wrong about US doing more Covid-19 testingOfcom\u0027s research found that the use of video calling services doubled to 70 per cent of the population during the lockdown, as people sought new ways to stay in touch.One of the biggest benefiters from this trend has been the app Zoom, which saw a huge surge in new users at the start of the lockdown.Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy, said Yij-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and research.Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will look for signs of Martian life in the past, as well as gathering materials from the surface that will one day be returned to Earth.The launch has been pushed back to 30 July at the very earliest, the space agency announced, leaving it with only half the expected launch window.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNasa must send the rover and the rocket carrying it into space by 15 August, or Mars will move too far away for the mission to be launched at all.If that happens, engineers will have to wait until 2022, when the planets will align in the right way once again.Nasa plans to fly a helicopter on MarsThe space agency said that it hopes to be able to push back the window, giving it more time to attempt the launch, to avoid the 26 month delay that could come with any further problems.Nasa has already been forced to delay the launch, in part because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad. It had originally been scheduled to go as soon as 17 July, before being pushed further and further into the month.United Launch Alliance, which made the rocket that will carry the rover to the red planet, said that it needed extra time to deal with problem readings during a recent practice for the launch, the space agency said in a release.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

And it’s a lovely unicorn.”After the newsreader’s input, Scarlett then begins to ask Dr Wenham: “What’s his name?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It has been called Super Saturday – when pubs across England are set to reopen for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown started in March.Tens of thousands of people are expected to head out for a long-awaited pint this weekend as restrictions are finally lifted.But, while many landlords and owners are hoping for a much-needed windfall few days, plenty across the country, it seems, will delay reopening – amid concerns of alcohol-fuelled mayhem.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThey fear they will not be able to enforce social distancing or keep on top of strict cleaning rotas amid the expected flood of partying punters.“People haven’t been to the pub for three months and now they’re finally getting to go after all that time,” said Heather Griffin, manager of Sheffield’s independently owned Rutland Arms. “It’s not hard to imagine what that might end up being like.”Brits to spend £210m in pubs this weekend as they reopenShe will not open for at least another week.“Everything is going to be completely different for pubs – table service, social distancing, constant cleaning – and it’s easier for staff to figure that out on a Monday afternoon, for instance, than it would be on a Saturday evening when people are more likely to be drinking more,” the 26-year-old added. “It will be a lot easier with sober customers.”It is a stance also being taken by Sunderland’s Ttonic, Chaplins, The Point and Arizona bars.In a statement posted online, managers there said that the “mass gatherings and intensity expected on Saturday isn’t worth putting our team under unnecessary risk and stress”.And they added: “We have been working hard getting our venue up to speed with all the safety measures in place including reviewing the capacity and what our customer journey will look like...We will not be opening until further notice and remain closed this weekend. Please understand our decision. We must protect our staff and the people in our city.”Treasury officials draw up plans to protect economy from coronavirusBut in Bristol one bar has decided to hold off opening for another, slightly different reason.Staff at the the Volunteer Tavern have discovered a bird nest in the garden with three blue speckled eggs just days from hatching.The animal – nicknamed Mama Mint by employees – appears to have made her home there while it has been out of action for three months, manager Pete Gibbs says.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Customs controls coming from the UK to the EU will be implemented in full on 1 January.Alex Veitch, head of International Policy at FTA, which represents freight transport companies, said:  “The logistics industry is keen to learn details of any system to facilitate the export of goods across  EU borders, and is ready to support the preparations of such a system so that it can be ready for January 1, 2021.  We are currently talking to UK government and EU partners to understand all the system requirements and brief our members. It takes two to tango, and we need both import and export systems to be ready, tested, and operational to keep Britain trading.”Despite a long history of UK government IT projects going wrong, HMRC officials say they are confident the scheme can be delivered and point to experience building platforms like the coronavirus furlough scheme as evidence.Asked about the plans, a UK government spokesperson said: At the end of this year we will control our own laws and borders, which is why we have taken the sovereign decision to introduce border controls in a way that gives businesses impacted by coronavirus time to adjust.Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

In a tweet on Wednesday, the Treasury wrote: “Grab a drink and raise a glass, pubs are reopening their doors from 4 July.” The post, which was accompanied by a graphic which read ”Pubs are back”, was quickly taken down after it prompted a backlash on social media, with critics suggesting that its celebratory tone ignored the reality of the epidemic which has killed almost 44,000 in the UK so far. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt came as Leicester became the first place in the UK to go into local lockdown after it experienced a spike in its number of Covid-19 cases.Geraint Davies, Labour MP for Swansea West, was among those who condemned the Treasury’s decision to publish the post.Pubs reopening on ‘Super Saturday’ will not be a triumphant homecomingWhen will pubs, cinemas, restaurants and hairdressers be open from?How pubs and restaurants will reopen after lockdownPubs in England-Wales border town must reopen at different times“This is wholly irresponsible publicity by the Conservative Government which will fuel a resurgence of coronavirus infection \u0026amp death in England,” Mr Davies said in a tweet.Mr Davies told The Independent that the government was intentionally pushing people into crowded pubs on a Saturday night, without suggesting masks and straws for instance.A Treasury source admitted the department had made a mistake with its message on the reopening of pubs, telling The Independent: “We got it wrong on this and the tweet was quickly removed.”The prime minister has also been criticised by some people for his choice of messaging during the health emergency.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The “yes” vote was even greater than the 76.7 per cent secured by the president at the last elections.The results apparently exceeded the Kremlin’s own predictions, with reports suggesting internal targets aimed for a turnout above 55 per cent, and yes vote above 60 per cent. Just one of 85 subjects – the Nenets Autonomous Okrug‚ in Russia’s far north – registered a “no” result.Why is Putin changing the constitution?But the vote was marred with evidence of vote rigging and unfair process. Opposition groups claimed their own exit polls showed the reverse result.According to the Nyet! movement, 54.9 per cent of voters voted against (official numbers: 34 per cent). The difference was even starker in St Petersburg, Russia’s northern capital, with 63.07 per cent projected as no-voters versus the official figure of 21.63 per cent.)The Golos election monitoring group, which registered more than 1500 reports of manipulations in a week of voting, described the process as an “attack on the sovereignty of the people”. The so-called plebiscite was no more than a “PR act”, the organisation claimed, “designed not to reflect the will of the nation, but to create an impression of that will that best suits the authorities.”Russia is, of course, well versed in the practice of dark election arts. But alongside these dark practices, a whole ecosystem of effective unofficial monitoring has emerged.The statistician Sergei Shpilkin has traditionally played a leading role in these efforts, dissecting publicly available data in all kinds of imaginative ways to look for evidence of irregularities.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSpeaking to The Independent on Thursday, Mr Shpilkin said modelling the numbers left him in no doubt the vote was the “most falsified nationwide election” in Russia’s post-Soviet history. According to the maths, he says, at least 22 million of the 74 million recorded ballots were suspicious.Graphs consistently showed an obvious cluster skew in favour of “yes” voting in areas with above average turnouts. This would be entirely consistent with ballot boxes being stuffed, or inidual polling results being arbitrarily fixed on a directive from above.National republics, dominated by authoritarian local leaders keen to please the Kremlin, as expected, returned implausibly high results. In the case of Chechnya, for example, 97.92 per cent supposedly voted for on a turnout of 95 per cent.But there were strange figures coming from the usually more circumspect regions like Volgograd (83 per cent for on turnout of 80 per cent) and Moscow region (79 per cent for a turnout of 76 per cent).“The level of fabrication is some way ahead of any nationwide election we have seen,” Mr Shpilkin said. “Using the same methodology, you find something in the range of 14-15 million stolen votes during the discredited Duma elections of 2011.”‘Like two guys in a steam bath’: Source describes Trump-Putin callsSupport for Putin wanes in his former Russian strongholdPutin says coronavirus is retreating and condemns anyone who disagreesPutin looms over Russia’s latest vote – but it’s not all about himThe vote was not a referendum in any strict sense. It was presented as an “all-nation vote” and conducted in a legally grey area that some argue was geared to ambiguity.Polling was stretched over an unprecedented seven days, and advanced home voting was allowed without the need to prove a valid reason. Independent party observers were not allowed at polling stations. Agitation for or against was not allowed. The Kremlin insisted the measures were introduced to ensure safe voting, but critics believe the aim was boosting support for their proposals.On the day of polling, election authorities shocked observers by publishing “preliminary” results a full five hours before voting ended. As remarkable was the absence of Vladimir Putin or any mention of his term limits from the electoral campaign. Official election literature and state media concentrated on 205 of the 206 proposed amendments – these promised everything from increased pensions and improved healthcare to traditional family values and good governance. The one key clause proposing allowing the president to continue in power routinely ignored.Konstantin Kalachyov, a leading Russian political analyst, said the president still retained the backing of “a majority” of Russians. But the Kremlin’s over-exuberance in securing high numbers was likely to create problems down the line. “The issue isn’t the numbers they’ve presented but the promises of fairness and good living they made,” he said.

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our talks were face-to-face for the first time since March and this has given extra depth and flexibility to our discussions.#The negotiations have been comprehensive and useful. But they have also underlined the signicant dferences that still remain between us on a number of important issues.#Talks in Brussels between Mr Frosts team and the EU side led by Michel Barnier were due to continue into Friday.Mr Frost said talks will continue next week in London. British firms are worried the governments planned systems to check goods going to the EU wont be ready in time by the Brexit transition period ends in . Boris Johnsons government is planning to bring an entirely new IT system to help check goods heading to the EU from the start of January.Rod McKenzie, the Road Haulage Associations Rod McKenzie, said confusion over how the IT system would work andit would be ready on time was #a cocktail for potential disaster at the moment#.He told Business Insider: #The worry over this new IT system is massive. You wouldnt think youd choose to run an entirely new and complex system with a bit of IT kit that nobody quite knows will actually work.#The French might be helpful when it comes to UK imports staying in France — but what about those going further afield  Its so unclear and so frustrating.#Economics minister John Glen has told lords that #we have not had any signicant feedback from the EU# on the UKs position in regards to financial services.

The leader of Change UK said:#Im a realist and the reality is weve left the European Union.#I dont think theres an appetite at large for some movement that would win widespread support for us to rejoin because we havent even fully left yet.#I think it will be my childrens generation that will do it, I think well be back in the EU in ten years time.#Of course well never get the unique and very special and very good deal that we once had.#No doubt the EU will say wellyou want to rejoin you have to join the Euro, youve got to join Schengen. We were in a unique position but theres no point in looking backwards, weve got to look to the future.#The pound sterling has stayed neutral against the euro as investors are assessing the probability of the UK being able to sign a trade deal with the EU by the end of this year.July is a critical month for the pound as by the end, it should become clear with Britain will walk away with a deal or not.Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy at BMO, said: #The second to last week and the last week of July are going to be the extreme Brexit crunch point.#If theres not movement by the week of th or the week of th, that may be the second wave of selling in sterling.#Against the euro, sterling was steady at . pence.Trading between the EU and UK will still flourish in the short-term even WITHOUT a Brexit deal, a top WTO candidate has said.Hamid Mamdouh, who is seeking to run the World Trade Organization, said that the historic alliance between Britain and the EU should allow for goods and services to continue to flow across the borders. The former WTO director of trade and services in investment said while on the broadcaster Econ Films’ CoronaNomics programme: #The UK and the EU have been following the same regulatory framework across sectors of the economy and that provides an exceptionally strong basis for strong and close trade relations, eventhey fall on WTO rules.“There will still be the reality of business flourishing in a way that, of course, isn’t as strong as when the UK was a member state of the EU, but it’s the passage of time without a bilateral agreement that will have an effect.” Tory former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine criticised Boris Johnsons investment plan to boost the economy.Lord Heseltine told BBC Radio s Today programme: “What we have is a twin crisis, which is the crisis of the corona epidemic… and it is over with the crisis of Brexit.“It is a crisis of unprecedented scale and it is going to get worse.“So, the question really is how is the Government responding, how should it respond “And I have to say I was deeply disappointed in the speech the Prime Minister made in Dudley.“It was simply the sort of speech with a lot of proposals which were remarkably similar to what all governments have done faced with rising unemployment.“They announce packets of money in housing and transport and repairs for the health service… but they lack the one thing that is essential, and that is the local enthusiasm, energy and enterprise.” The UK Government has unveiled a new body called #Office for Talent# to attract scientists, researchers and innovators to come to the country.It will make immigration #simple, easy and quick# for those wanting to move to the UK.It comes as scientists have warned of uncertainty over Brexit could see top researchers and innovators leaving the UK.The roadmap for the new Research and Development will cut #unnecessary red tape# to encourage the brightest and the best to work and study in the UK.It includes a £m investment for upgrading scientic infrastructure.EU and UK Brexit negotiators are set to hold a fourth day of talks in Brussels.Boris Johnosn has refused to extend the current Brexit transition period which means both sides will have to find an agreement before the end of this year.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the EU must prepare to not reach a deal.The Chairman of Germanys Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee Norbert Roettgen has had some strong words to say about a no-deal Brexit. Speaking with Channel  News, he said #both sides are to blame#a no-deal Brexit went ahead.The prospect #would be disadvantageous to both sides# but it would #hit Britain much harder# the MP said.However, he added: #We still can do something # we are living in a threatening, chaotic world and we have to stay together because unity means strength.#Britain is alone # we are #.Angela Merkel says Britain will have to #live with the consequences# of Boris Johnsons decision to loosen economic ties with the EU in the event of a no-deal exit.The PM scrapped the idea of maintaining close economic ties with the EU after the Brexit transition period ends on December . The German chancellor said: #We need to let go of the idea that it is for us to define what Britain should want. That is for Britain to define – and we, the EU, will respond appropriately.#With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves.#It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy.#Lord Heseltine, the architect of government plans for urban renewal in the s, said he believed Brexit added uncertainty and unpredictability to the issues created by the coronavirus pandemic. “Brexit and COVID add-up to one great question mark,# he said. #Its no use just making speeches that just talk about bouncing this way or that. The people who are going to be making the decisions are hard-headed, responsible iniduals. #Theyre not going to listen to political speeches before they make political decisions. #They will look at the hard facts as they see them on the ground. What are our sales like  What order books are we facing  What markets do we think were going to penetrate  #What trade deals has anyone actually signed  When you start answering those questions you can begin to talk about bounce. But until you answer those questions you are spitting in the wind”.He said he believed that taxes would have to rise as a result of the pandemic, saying that “someones got to pay for the spending round that COVID has injected in to our economy”.Brexit-basher George Soros has predicted the coronavirus crisis could doom the EU and #destroy capitalism as we know it#. Soros fears because the EU project is not finished its struggling to deal with the fast developing Covid- catastrophe.The Hungarian-born currency speculator, now a US citizen, also predicts the extraordinary economic slump that is expected to unfold in the coming months could change the face of capitalism.The anti-Brexit campaigner and donor to the second referendum campaign made the forecasts in an interview with the Independent.He said: #I am particularly concerned about the survival of the EU because it is an incomplete union.#It was in the process of being created.#But the process was never completed and that makes Europe exceptionally vulnerable – more vulnerable than the US not just because it is an incomplete union but also because it is based on the rule of law.#And the wheels of justice move very slowly, while threats such as the Covid- virus move very fast.#Hopes of a COVID- vaccine pulled European stocks from losses earlier on Wednesday, after fears of a no-deal Brexit and anxieties relating to the European Unions recovery fund had weighed on sentiment.Ending a choppy session, the pan-European STOXX  index rose . per cent, with blue-chip indexes in Paris, Milan and London down about . per cent. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic got a boost as a COVID- vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and German biotech firm BioNTech showed promise and was found to be well tolerated in early-stage human trials.Former PM Theresa May yesterday hit out at Boris Johnson after he appointed his Brexit negotiator to be his new national security adviser.Speaking in the Commons, she suggested David Frost did not have the required expertise or independence to succeed Sir Mark Sedwill in the role.But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said Mr Frost was highly qualied and would be accountable to the PM.Mr Frost is a former civil servant, having left the Foreign Office in  to work in the private sector.He is due to take on the role at the end of August.Mrs May, who appointed Sir Mark to both roles when she was PM, asked Mr Gove: #Why is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security #Image: PAThe SNP could withdraw from UK institutions # including the House of Commons #Boris Johnsons Government continues to block a second Scottish independence referendum, one of the partys most senior MPs has suggested.Pete Wishart, an SNP MP for almost two decades, said the party could consider #withdrawing from the apparatus of the UK state#Westminster continues to reject calls for a fresh vote on the issue.This could be #escalated# to the extent of impacting on the SNPs #participation in institutions of the UK Parliament#, he added.Mr Wishart arguedWestminster continues to refuse calls for a referendum, the Scottish Government could try to seek the support of the European Union and the international community for such a ballot.The UK has insisted that it wants to #work constructively# with the EU.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: #We believe that there is a free trade agreement to be reached but we have also been very clear that we will be prepared for either eventuality at the end of the year, whether that be a free trade agreement or having a trading relationship based on the same terms that Australia currently has.#Australia does not yet have a formal trade deal with the EU.Image: AFPDowning Street has stressed the UK will be prepared to trade with the European Union without a formal agreement as German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Brussels to step up preparations for a no-deal scenario.Mrs Merkel suggested progress so far had been #very limited# and the EU must be ready for the possibility that #a deal doesnt materialise#.Germany has assumed the rotating EU Council presidency for the next six months, giving the chancellor an influential role in the final phase of the Brexit process.Mrs Merkel told the German parliament that although talks between the UK and EU were intensying, the EU #must be prepared# for the possibility that a deal will not be reached.Tory MPs have blocked a bid to prevent prime ministers being nominated without the consent of Parliament.Bringing forward such proposals, SNP Cabinet Office spokesman Pete Wishart said any prime minister should demonstrate that they have the confidence of the Commons.The Prime Ministerand CabinetBill was brought forward with Theresa May and Boris Johnson having both previously assumed office without a general election.Referencing the period of ill-health suffered by Boris Johnson earlier this year, Mr Wishart argued: #All of us are right relieved to see the Prime Minister back in such rude health, press-upping his way to his disastrous Brexit.#And looking at this epitome of a butchers dog, its hard to believe that it was touch and go for him only a few short weeks ago and thank goodness that the Prime Minister pulled through.#But what we found with the Prime Ministers incapacitation was the equivalent of government by headless chicken.#Without the Prime Ministers customary decisiveness and note for detail, we had no real idea who was running the country.#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everybody is so reliant on somebody  providing everything for them that when things did get a little bit tense the results were scary.“And when we saw that, we were extremely glad we’d come here.”Matthew and Charis’ way of le has become the new frontier for many as the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a huge rise in people seeking advice on how to prepare for the possibility that civilisation could collapse.While the idea is far from a new one - just ask the Mayans or the Romans - France has witnessed an explosion in students of la collapsologie, or collapsology, in the wake of the virus.In the UK, retailers selling basic survival goods have seen sales rocket up to , per cent, while others want those who live self-sufficiently like Matthew and Charis to teach them how to not depend on others to survive.Here, Sun Online explores the collapsology movement, askingcivilisation is truly crumbling and,so, is coronavirus the beginning of the end Doomsdayers. Survivalists. Preppers. There are countless names and iations for those who believe the end is nigh.Many are dismissed as conspiracy theorists. But while collapsology has its roots in the same idea, the reaction on how to cope is dferent.Rather than bunkering down alone in an abandoned nuclear facility and preparing to weather the storm alone, the movement aims to save society as a society - starting rural, communal lestyles while welcoming communication with the wider world.One collapsology Facebook group in France has seen its numbers reach , members during lockdown and the idea is turning mainstream thanks to support from senior politicians, respected authors and a popular Black Mirror-style drama series.The movement was born on the back of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jared Diamond’s celebrated book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed in .The work focuses on the effect environmental impacts - such as droughts, dwindling crop yields and swings in temperature - had on ancient civilisations. However, Diamond also looks at the similarities those societies faced with today’s world - including environmental changes, the impact of climate change, hostile neighbours and trade partners.The theory was further popularised by a  book, How Everything Can Collapse, by Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens.Some of its supporters, like former French environment minister Yves Cochet, believe the coronavirus crisis is just a further sign of impending catastrophe.People who follow the collapsology movement aren’t waiting for the apocalypse, nor believe the end of the world is fast-approaching.More, they are expecting and preparing for the fall of our current civilised society.Unlike doomsday preppers and other survivalist movements, collapsologists live among us in mainstream society and don’t intend to frighten people.Rather, they work to prove the number of potential crises that could burst one day and explore what we can do to ease this.People in the collapsology movement think about how we can prepare the new world to be built quickly and in the best way.While the term is yet to truly take hold in the UK, thousands have been looking at becoming more independent since coronavirus hit.“Our sales have gone through the roof, as high as a , per cent increase since January, says Lincoln Miles, , owner of Preppers Shop UK in Newquay, Cornwall.“The supermarket panic buying in March definitely showed us how fragile it all is and how quickly everything can change. “I think we only just avoided what could have been a real crisis, but the fact that it got so close to it made people wake up and realise we can’t rely on this because this could happen again.The fragility of the whole system was exposed.”Many followers of collapsology are keen to stress it isn’t just another Facebook conspiracy video, nor is it the prediction of the sudden and apocalyptic end of the world.It’s about uniting to act upon scientists’ warnings on the effects of climate change, as well as archaeologists study of how whole empires can fail.Loïc Steffan, a French economist and author of Don’t Be Scared of Collapse, says Covid- “was a stress-test that has allowed us to see what works and what doesn’t”.The self-declared optimist, who is a prominent figure in the French movement, adds: “The collapsologist wants to save society. The survivalist is an inidualist.”For others, it’s a commitment to sustainability, while helping others to do the same.The movement, which sprung from Jared Diamonds  book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, struck a chord with many, including Essex vets Matthew and Charis.“I had read a few collapsology books, including Jared Diamond’s, and found that I myself had had a collapse in faith in the stories of our culture and societies,” reveals Matthew.“The scientists’ warnings are pretty stark, and often not stark enough.“I just started to think: ‘You know, I’d be more comfortable with a little patch of land where I could learn to provide our needs for ourselves rather than relying on mortgages from banks and food from supermarkets,’ so that’s what we did.” Matthew and Charis, , bought three acres of land in Pembrokeshire for £, and spent a further £, on building a house, chicken coops, greenhouses, a horse poo-powered gas cooker and even a hot tub.They are entirely self-sufficient, installing solar , growing their own fruit and veg, building beehives, rearing up to  chickens and converting lorries and flatbed hay trailers into zero-carbon living quarters.“We haven’t gone full hippy though,” adds Matthew. “We still have Netflix and Disney+. We aren’t cut off from le entirely - but we are entirely dependent on ourselves now.Since buying the land in  and making the full-time move a year later, Matthew and Charis have had daughter Elsa and son Billy.As their lives on Beeview Farm have grown, so has the buzz about it from others.After years of mistakes and learning on the job, Matthew and Charis are now running farm tours and even classes so others can follow.“We’ve only been running the tours and courses for about a year and the interest has been growing, Matthew adds.“People are desperate to come but we’ve had to postpone visits because of the virus.“There are people who want to do it and our message is: ‘Go. Just do it, do it.’“If you trust what the scientists are saying in any way then you don’t have time to waste waiting for it to be proved.”Is it the beginning of the end  It all depends on who you ask.In France, Yves Cochet, a former environment minister for the government, predicted the start of the end by  as a result of a petrol crisis or environmental change.However, after coronavirus, he now says: “It’s happening even faster than we thought.”In the UK, one of the country’s few academic “collapsologists” Dr Guy Middleton remains wary of making total apocalyptic predictions.The Newcastle University lecturer, whose published books include Understanding Collapse: Ancient History and Modern Myths, says: “Putting it in terms of Extinction Rebellion or Greta Thunberg, the idea that action is necessary now, is really important - but without the survivalist mentality.“Our society now sits on a scale that is absolutely unprecedented including the rate of extinction of marine and land species, pollution of oceans, plastic pollution and so on. “But I tend to think that humanity will stagger on until it absolutely can’t. It might lose a lot of people but it’s probably not going to be in the next  years.“We are a resilient and adaptable species.”Words like “scary”, “collapse” and “catastrophe” are often used when describing the reasons people decide to quit “normal le”.However, Matthew insists the two biggest factors others should follow suit are entirely positive.He says: “One, it is terric fun. And two, it just makes complete financial sense.“The dficulty of doing it sometimes stems from the ‘prepper movement’, I would never describe us as preppers. But it is often seen as revolving around conspiracy theories.“We’re going with the scientists - it’s a good idea to prep, but we’re not prepping for the Millennium Bug or anything like that.“We’ve built a farm for a lot less than £, and it’s all ours. “We don’t owe anybody any money and we don’t have any bills - why aren’t more people doing this ”Lincoln, who has run the UK’s biggest prepper shop, for almost seven years, believes people are keen to strike a balance between convenience and independence.He adds: “I’m not sure whether people are necessarily moving off grid due to it but there’s definitely a huge resurgence in people going back to the old ways of doing it themselves, like making their own bread or learning actual skills rather than relying on products from a shop. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.“There’s a lot of going back to basics and learning to do it from scratch.“People are thinking how they can filter water rather than buy water or provide their homes with energythere was no electricity, changing their houses to be a bit more off-grid without living in the wild.“It’s worth being ready.

Using your skill and ingenuity, you have to predict which town or city will be the next to be put on special measures .⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesTowns and cities where people haven’t been behaving themselves.Right now, it’s Leicester in the sin bin. They are a very community-minded bunch and couldn’t resist going out to meet each other. So there’s a Covid spike.Experts reckon the next place to cop it will be Doncaster. They’re a friendly bunch there, too. But I reckon there’s a decent outside chance it will be Bournemouth or Brighton. Or maybe Cardf is worth a flutter.The people of Leicester are confused, as well they might be. They don’t know what they’re allowed to do any more. I don’t blame them.But it will be as nothing to the confusion across the country which comes as a result of Super Saturday.July  is the day the Government has said we can shake off our chains and go out and get wrecked. Or something.Have you got any plans for the weekend  Going to a rave  Or just down the pub to breathe over as many people as you possibly can. Here’s my big worry. That Super Saturday will be followed, five days later, by Terrible Thursday.Five days is the average time it takes for the Covid virus to make itself known to the person it has taken up home in. That slightly ticklish cough. Bit of a temperature. Uh-oh.Restaurants, pubs, campsites and children’s playgrounds will all be open for business from Saturday. Oh, and hairdressers. Remember them Obviously, it is right that the UK must emerge from what the Prime Minister called its long hibernation. But I think these things need to be done gradually, rather than all at once.Frankly, I would have started with our schools. Teachers have proved themselves to be just about the only people in the country who can’t work from home. Most kids have enjoyed painfully few virtual lessons, and reopening schools first would have shown where our priorities lie.But it’s not a good idea, in my book, to release the bats all in one go. Many people will have taken from Boris’s announcement last week that, after July , lockdown is effectively over.And some of the Government’s guidelines make it easy to be confused.  The two-metre social-distancing rule has been relaxed to something called “one metre-plus”. I haven’t a clue what dference that makes.And the whole thing is very dficult to monitor. The police say they don’t know how they will deal with it.The virus has been dying out because, by and large, we have been abiding by lockdown. The summer sun has helped, too. The best thing we can do to keep that curve plummeting is to do much as we have been doing so far.The last thing we need this summer is a sudden second spike.If you use that phrase you’re supposedly signalling you’re vulnerable. And need attention. But what about the ones who really did have pasta and liked it  And aren’t at all messed up but just want to share their evening meal experiences in a very real sense  They are strange creatures, the young.THE country is on course for a wonderful, “V-shaped economic recovery”, according to a bloke at the Bank of England.I don’t know what that means. A month or so back, the Bank of England was saying the economy was in ruins for ever, mass unemployment, bankruptcies – giant mutant crabs marching across the country eating our children. Or something.Never believe an economist. You’d be better off talking to Mystic Meg.THE latest historical figure to be attacked by people with no sense of history is Charles Dickens.A former Green Party councillor, Ian Driver, sprayed graffiti on a museum to the author, with the inevitable word “racist”.I supposewe were to ban Dickens, it would bring cheer to millions of schoolkids.Great Expectations can be a bit of a grind to get through when you are young.But this tearing down of history has to stop.Was Dickens racist  Yup. He lived in Victorian Britain. Almost everybody had views which wouldn’t go down very well today.But he was also a brilliant writer and a philanthropist.We are all better than our worst acts.The Chinese authorities are reportedly sterilising these people now – taking a leaf out of Hitler’s book. Yet this outrage raises barely a flicker of publicity. Even other Muslim countries don’t complain too much. That’s because they don’t want to upset the third worst country in the world . And what does the United Nations say  Nothing. Just like it says nothing about China’s occupation of Tibet, or its bullying of democracy campaigners in Hong Kong.A GOOD plan from the Prime Minister. Boris wants to turn the deserted shops in our high streets into homes for people.If he did that, he’d cure half of our housing problem very quickly. Without paving over the entire country for new estates.Many of our high streets are decaying. People now go to out-of-town shopping centres for an afternoon of misery with the missus.But here’s another idea for BoJo. Offices.Lockdown proved we don’t need offices like we used to. They were invented because we needed places to shuffle paper around. But we don’t use paper any more. And during lockdown people worked perfectly well from home.Imagine how many homes we could create by changing offices into flats.And how much rent businesses would save.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Anyone who falls within the lockdown boundary has been urged to stay at home and avoid non-essential travel to and from the area.Yaz, who lives within the lockdown border with her hubby and three-year-old son Hazia in Barkby Thorpe, told the Sun Online: It’s so disappointing. Just when we thought we were back to some normality and making plans to see family, friends and our new neighbours this happens. The crazy thing is me and my immediate neighbour are now stuck in a zone with restrictions imposed but one neighbour and other householders down the road are out of it and free to enjoy the easing of rules from Saturday.The -year-old customer service adviser moved into her three-bed mews house shortly before the nation-wide lockdown began.She had been hoping to make friends with support worker Siri, , who has a five-year-old daughter Chanelle, but the new rules mean they will have to wait.Siri said: We havent had a chance to get to know each other and just have snatched conversations at a distance on the doorstep or on the drive. We wanted to get together properly and introduce the kids as soon as possible.It’s ridiculous that I could soon go to the pub or a hair salon allowed to open but I cant go into my neighbour’s home two doors away or she visit mine. I’m happy to be out of the zone but I have no idea why they’ve split out little street in two. It’s quite ridiculous that some of can have freedoms that other’s cant enjoy.The new rules do not state children from dferent zones cannot play together, but people are urged not to travel between them.Yaz, who has been self-isolating with her family, said: Everyone’s getting sick of it now, its been going on too long.She blames the local lockdown on lots of people with no interest in playing their part, adding: We’d rather be safe than sorry and we have to be careful because my husband suffers from an illness. Hopefully it will only be another fortnight before we can enjoy relaxed measures like the rest of my street.Siri cant wait to get back to her new-normality but agrees with her neighbour that a second lockdown was the right thing to do to stop the virus spreading.Leicestershire police Chief Constable Simon Cole said yesterday that he had “huge sympathy” with people living on streets that had been cut down the middle on the lockdown map. But he added: “You’ve got to draw the line somewhere.”Mr Cole said the force hopes “common sense will prevail” and will only enforce restrictions such as road blocks as a last resort.He added that all locked down locals need to do is stay at home: “It’s a pretty simple equation really - we live in an area where there’s a very, very dangerous disease that makes people really ill, and we currently, sadly, lead the nation in that illness.“What people are being asked to do is stay at home, what people are being asked to do is only travelit’s absolutely essential.A postcode checker has now been produced to try to end the confusion over which parts of Leicestershire are in the local lockdown area and which are not. It comes as neighbouring areas have raised concerns that people from Leicester will travel outside of the lockdown this weekend. Nottinghamshire Police said it is working with British Transport Police to clamp down on unnecessary travel from Leicester, while pubs in Nottingham have vowed to turn away Leicester residents who try to chance a pint this weekend.

For the most recent data,  per cent of people were reached to provide close contact details, and in non-complex about two thirds of contacts are ultimately reached.  There are complex cases too. Therefore perhaps -% of close contacts of people testing positive are actually asked, and we dont know the proportion of infected people who never take a test.He also added that more appropriate reporting is needed as well as automatic tracing through apps.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Housing minister Lord Greenhalgh said ending the ban on evictions was was an important step towards ending lockdown. It comes amid warnings homelessness could treble this year unless the government acts. And there are calls for the government to reverse the heartless decision.Landlords were banned from evicting tenants during the coronavirus crisis - and still arenapost allowed to start the process until August .But in response to a parliamentary question, Housing minister Lord Greenhalgh said this would soon come to an end. He said: From  August , the courts will begin to process possession cases again. This is an important step towards ending the lockdown and will protect landlords’ important right to regain their property. Work is underway with the judiciary, legal representatives and the advice sector on arrangements, including new rules, to ensure that judges have all the information necessary to make just decisions and that the most vulnerable tenants can get the help they need when possession cases resume. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran commented: “The idea that the government want to re-start evictions in the midst of a pandemic is unthinkable. This threatens a wave of homelessness in towns up and down the country, which added to that the threat of local lockdowns could create a toxic cocktail for the disease to thrive. Generation Rent this week warned homelessness could treble this year unless the government acts to help private renters. According to the group, rates of rent arrears have risen from % before the pandemic to %, which could make , households homeless.

A string of measures that were designed to stop the spread of the virus have been axed after they made it impossible to have everyone in at once. Unions had pleaded for extra money to open up classrooms in public buildings and have blended learning from home. But instead the government is telling schools to use exactly the same space they had before the pandemic. No money will be given for extra classrooms and schools are banned from running rotas. Pupils are expected in five days a week and there will be fines for absence. To squeeze everyone in, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will scrap the -pupil size limit on class bubbles - who stay together to stop the virus spreading further. Bubbles will now be an entire -pupil class or even an entire year group. Despite the massive increase, the rule that children must automatically isolateone member of their bubble tests positive has been scrapped. Instead, a whole class or year group may have to stay homean aposoutbreakapos is detected in a school - but this will be decided on a case-by-case basis. While staff are told to keep two metres apart from pupils where possible, the guidance accepts that in many cases that wonapost be possible between the pupils themselves. Instead, teachers will be told to keep the windows open, quarantine footballs for  hours between use, ban big school wind bands and choirs, and send any sick pupils home quickly. Despite this, shielding children are being advised to come back in - as are pregnant or vulnerable staff where there isnapost another option. The guidance accepts opening schools is a balance of risk - but says for the vast majority of children, the benefits of being back in school far outweigh the very low risk from coronavirus. Exams in  will go ahead but schools wonapost have toto the full curriculum until summer  as they focus on the areas where pupils most need to catch up. Year  pupils will consider dropping some of their GCSE subjectsit means they can preserve their grades in core subjects like English and maths. Hereaposs a round up of some of the key changes to advice to schools announced today. Children wonapost automatically have to isolatesomeone  in their class tests positive  The -pupil aposbubbleapos limit will be scrapped - allowing schools to create aposbubblesapos of a whole class or a whole year. aposBubblesapos were introduced as an anti-infection measure. They meant groups within the school were kept separate from each other - andone member of a bubble tested positive, the whole bubble had to go into isolation for two weeks. Bubbles will now be allowed to be much larger - and wonapost have to go into isolationone member tests positive. Instead a aposrapid risk assessmentapos will be carried out to determine who has been in aposclose contactapos with a child who tests positive - and tell them to self-isolate for two weeks.  Schools may have an outbreakthey have two or more confirmed cases of  coronavirus  within a fortnight. Government guidance says the whole site or year group may have to self-isolate at home. But it adds whole-school closures will not generally be necessaryschools implement the recommended controls. If there is an outbreak in a school, a mobile unit can be dispatched to test others who have been in contact with the person who has tested positive. Testing will focus on the personaposs class, followed by their year group, then the whole schoolnecessary, the guidance says. Schools are having to keep aposrecordsapos of close contact - yes, really Because isolation is no longer automatic, schools are being told to note down close contacts to trace infection. The guidance says: We recommend schools keep a record of pupils and staff in each group, and any close contact that takes places between children and staff in dferent groups. It adds: This should be a proportionate recording process. Schools do not need to ask pupils to record everyone they have spent time with each day or ask staff to keep definitive records in a way that is overly burdensome. Children will be expected to attend in person, full time - without rotas  Some hoped the government would re-open schools on a aposrotaapos basis, to cut the number of children in school at a given time and make social distancing easier. But from September, thataposs all out of the window. Children will be expected to attend, in person, five days a week. They say schools will be made aposCovid secureapos by:grouping children together avoiding contact between groups arranging classrooms with forward facing desks staff maintaining distance from pupils and other staff as much as possibleSchools will be sent home testing kits to give to parents  By September, all schools will be provided with a small number of home testing kits directly. They can then give these to parents or carers collecting a child who has developed symptoms at school. Or to staff who have developed symptoms at school, where they think providing one will signicantly increase the likelihood of them getting tested. Advice will be provided alongside these kits. Shielding children will be told to come back to school  As shielding advice changes for adults on August , it will also change for children. As such, any pupils who remain on the shielded patient list can alsoto school, as can those who have family members who are shielding. Butthereaposs a local outbreak, and the government reintroduces some level of shielding - theyaposll be allowed to stay home temporarily. There wonapost be any special rules for children from BAME backgrounds. Despite evidence that coronavirus poses a greater risk to people from BAME backgrounds, there will be no relaxation of rules for children based on ethnicity. Or children with other known aggravating factors, for that matter - including obesity and diabetes. Instead, when it comes to at-risk kids, the guidance simply says schools should tell parents to stop worrying and send their kids in. We recommend schools discuss their concerns and provide reassurance of the measures they are putting in place to reduce the risk in school. All children have to go to school - or face fines  The advice is very clear in this respect, stating simply that all pupils must attend school. It adds: If parents of pupils with signicant risk factors are concerned, we recommend schools discuss their concerns and provide reassurance of the measures they are putting in place to reduce the risk in school. Schools should be clear with parents that pupils of compulsory school age must be in school unless a statutory reason applies . Schools and councils will bring back the availability to issue sanctions, including fixed penalty notices. The government doesnapost think schools need to make adaptations or open new buildings. Just open a window  Picking a fight with teachers, unions and many parents - the government says it doesnapost think schools will need to make any signicant adaptations to reopen to all students. Nor does the government think taking over additional buildings - like church halls and community centres, as has been suggested - will be necessary. Guidance says bluntly: Schools should use their existing resources to make arrangements to welcome all children back. There are no plans at present to reimburse additional costs incurred as part of that process. Instead, the advice suggests improving ventilation in classrooms - including by opening windows. And it says while schools should avoid clogging up in corridors, passing briefly in the corridor or playground is low risk. It adds: Dferent groups don’t need to be allocated their own toilet blocks, but toilets will need to be cleaned regularly and pupils must be encouraged to clean their hands thoroughly after using the toilet. The full curriculum may notuntil next summer  Schools are asked to teach an ambitious and broad curriculum in all subjects but will have to focus on covering the most important gaps. The guidance admits: Substantial modication to the curriculum may be needed at the start of the year. Teaching time should be prioritised to address signicant gaps in pupils’ knowledge with the aim of ing to the school’s normal curriculum content by no later than summer term . Year  pupils may drop some GCSE subjects  The guidance says: In exceptional circumstances, it may be in the best interests of a year  pupil to discontinue an examined subject. This may bethe school decides they would achieve signicantly better in their remaining subjects as a result - especially in English or maths.School trips will be back on While overnight visits will be discouraged, day trips will be allowed. The guidance also suggests schools should make use of outdoor spaces in the local area to support delivery of the curriculum. School choirs, hymns in assembly and brass bands are out Thereaposs an increased risk of infection from singing, chanting and playing blown instruments. While the advice doesnapost ban singing and wind instrument lessons, it does say they should happen outsidepossible. And it says: Singing, wind and brass playing should not take place in larger groups such as school choirs and ensembles, or school assemblies. Footballs will go into  hoursapos quarantine Resources that are shared between classes or bubbles, such as sports, art and science equipment, should be cleaned frequently and meticulously between use. Thereaposs an alternativethis isnapost possible - they can berotated to allow them to be left unused and out of reach for a period of  hours. That increases to  hours when the material is plastic. Assemblies remain banned - and break and start times are to be staggered  Groups should be kept apart, meaning that schools should avoid large gatherings such as assemblies or collective worship, the guidance says. Schools should also consider staggered break times and lunch times . Schools should work with partners to consider staggered start times to enable more journeys to take place outside of peak hours. Pupils are being told to walk or cycle Schools should encourage parents, staff and pupils to walk or cycle to schoolat all possible. Driving may be an option for some. For those who have to take dedicated school buses, they will follow the same social distancing rules and mask-wearing as public transport.

It’s been happening for years. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced he was planning to make it even worse. Social cleansing of our cities is re and no one seems to care. Permitted development isn’t sexy. In fact, the policy itself sounds like it might even been a good idea. Take a load of derelict office blocks and turn them into much-needed housing and speed up the planning process. In fact, while you’re at it, demolish vacant residential and commercial properties like old factories and turn them into housing without planning permission. What’s not to like  In fact, the prime minister likes it so much that yesterday he announced a widening of permitted development rights to cover the conversion of even more commercial buildings and empty shops into housing. Apparently councils are blockers when it comes to building homes. The truth is that permitted development is the worst example of laws with unintended consequences to have been passed in the last five years. Ever since its inception in , it has been the driving force behind a previously unforeseen social cleansing of boroughs, a displacement of families and an increase in homelessness and social ision. It should be ended, not extended. For those blissfully unaware of what is happening, here’s the reality. All across the country, there are developers and landlords taking buildings that they can no longer rent out to businesses, and turning them into housing. They don’t need a single vote from a single councillor in a single planning committee meeting. If they want to do it, they can. The result is that the conversions are often incredibly poor quality as developers look to ide their floor space into as many studio apartments as possible. For most of us, we would look at the space and quality of these homes and run a mile from any estate agent offering us the chance to call one our home. But these developers are far from stupid. Before they press ahead with the conversion, they cosy up to councils who have a desperately long homeless and vulnerable persons list. They offer the councils a quick fix to get their homeless housed but offering entire floors of rooms for rent in these new blocks. Again, doesn’t sound too tragic. Homes for people who need them  What’s not to like   The unintended consequence comes next. The developers don’t rent the apartments to the local authority where the development lies. They look for the councils that pay a higher housing benefit who are willing to ship tenants out. For councils that are close to major cities, this is a huge problem. I’m the Leader of Basildon Council which sits  miles outside the border of Greater London. In my borough, once the developers buy up the offices, do a quick and dirty conversion into low quality, cramped flats, they are then leasing them to London councils desperate to find somewhere to place their homeless families. They can get higher yields from London authorities paying the higher rate of London housing allowance, rather than renting locally. This makes our own local housing problems more acute. For example, a landlord can earn £. per week in rent for a one-bedroom flat from Basildon Council or they can earn £. per week in rent for the same flat from a London Borough. Which do you think the landlord is going to go for  The iniduals and families placed in these permitted development conversions are often some of the most dficult to place – they are vulnerable peopleand have a high level of need. In the past four years, there have been more than , of these households placed in Essex by London and East of England local housing authorities, including almost , children. More than three in four of these placements have been into the boroughs of Basildon and Harlow. In the last  years, we have had an entire primary school’s worth of children come into the borough. Our infrastructure cannot cope. One of the major consequences of bypassing local authority planning committees is that no consideration needs to be taken by the developer of the need to consider the provision of health, education or other facilities. Councillors are unable to press them for monies to contribute towards the increase in demand on local services which inevitably come under increasing strain. The families placed suffer from being thrown into unfamiliar surroundings, often far from family and friendship networks. This is no way to solve our housing crisis – and it is no way to build communities. It is a vicious circle, not a virtuous one. What is more, in over % of cases, my council isn’t even made aware that vulnerable and sometimes dangerous tenants have been moved out of London Boroughs and into my borough. So much so that unbeknown to my council, we had a situation when two rival London gangs had been moved into the same permitted development block in the borough without Essex police or Basildon Council even knowing. Meanwhile the developer is long gone, pocketing their money from the London Councilaposs coffers. And the knock on effect then spreads further. Because its not just the permitted development landlords who start to realise they can make a quick buck out of the plight of , homeless Londoners.  So in the private rented sector, where Basildon Council has spent decades fostering relationships with local landlords to provide housing to local people at social rents, those landlords are now ending their tenancies with Basildon tenants and opting instead to take London tenants for more money. It means people who have been in their homes for years on social rents are being given the boot, often being made homeless by landlords who realise they can make more cash. The only recourse then available to Basildon Council is look for accommodation for them further out of London where our housing allowance is comparable to the local levels. This can mean people who have lived their whole le in Basildon, forced to move to Bradford or Bolsover overnight.

We were thinking about how can we just keep things going in this time, and give ourselves something to do, says Tommy. And give something to all these families who were suddenly trapped inside, maybe without gardens or lots of things to do. Or maybe they were worried about their jobs or couldn’t work and didn’t have any money.

A study of , adults found three quarters have a new aposquar-routineapos following lockdown which sees them leaving food shopping in bags for an average of  minutes before unpacking it. And post and deliveries are left for  minutes before touching them. Almost four in  have added cleaning door handles to their usual cleaning routine, % wear a face mask to the supermarket and % no longer pet dogs when out on a walk. The research, which was commissioned by Fulvisafe, a new non-alcohol, antiviral and anti-bacterial sanitizer brand, also found % are more aware of their hygiene habits now.  This has seen the average adult wash their hands nine times a day - compared to just six prior to the pandemic. And % intend to stick to their new routine and habits even when the lockdown period is over, with a third claiming they will always be more anxious of germs and hygiene from now on.Nicola Smuts-Allsop, founder of Fulvisafe, said: The nation is more aware of combating germs since the coronavirus outbreak and it is clear people have changed their everyday routines to stay as safe as possible.With the statistics showing people will stick to their new routine for at least a few months - and an eighth of people for up to a year - this paints a picture of the new normal for many. Hand sanitizer, facemasks and gloves are now handbag essentials but there is a lot of unknown around what products are in many sanitizers and how safe they are to be using continuously.  Our new hand sanitizer and barrier cream both protect and moisturise throughout the day while being alcohol-free and safe to use on babies. The research also found a third of Brits have cleaned their house more often with  per cent wiping down surfaces more regularly. And % have even increased the number of showers they have. More than half now take hand sanitizer out with them when they leave the house, %carry gloves and three in  always have anti-bacterial wipes on them. Similarly, % take tissues out with them and one in  even pack a change of clothes. But with % of respondents washing their hands for at least  seconds nowadays, a quarter have suffered with dry and cracked hands and  per cent have been moisturising them more regularly. Almost half have noticed that using alcohol-based sanitizer has had a detrimental effect on their skin and % have reduced their use of it as a result.  More than one in  are anxious about the amount of alcohol used in hand sanitizing products and % would like to know more about the ingredients used. It also emerged a sixth of those polled, via OnePoll, are worried about the long-term damage on their skin due to washing their hands more often. And of those surveyed who are parents, a quarter have struggled to find hygiene products which are safe and gentle for their child since the coronavirus outbreak. Nicola Smuts-Allsop added: The research shows that people are finding that the high levels of alcohol in some sanitizers is damaging their skin, as result many are not washing their hands as long or as often. Fulvisafe is kind to skin, even for babies. Fulivsafe, contains a new hero ingredient CHD-FA, which has been scientically proven to inhibit influenzaaposs like coronavirus, kills  per cent of germs and has no bleaches or harmful chemicals.

Pub chain Wetherspoons plans to reopen all  of its venues on Saturday after owner Tim Martin revealed it was spending £ million introducing a raft of changes to its pubs to ensure they were coronavirus-safe. Boris Johnson said there will be minimal staff and customers will be asked to order via apps to reduce social contact when boozers reopen. In venues where two metres isnapost possible, customers will be allowed sit one metre apart so long as measures are put into place, such as back-to-back seating, perspex screens and partitions between tables. There will also be disposable menus and one-in-one-out queues for washrooms. Customers will also be asked to share their contact details at the entrance thanks to a new partnership with the NHSaposs test and trace initiative. Despite Mr Johnson giving pubs the green light to reopen, many will stay shut over safety fears. Among them are Sunderland bars Ttonic, Chaplins, The Point, Glitter Ball and Arizona, which say they want to put safety first.

Gary Henderson, , plunged ft to his death from a flat in Duke Street, Ipswich, Suffolk. He was declared dead at the scene after being found at .am on June  in an inner garden courtyard beneath the third storey balcony. His sister Kim Henderson said today: My whole family are devastated by the sudden death of my brother in these unexplained circumstances. Gary was a gentle and very caring man who would always help anybody in need. Iaposve received a lot of calls from people touched by his kindness and thataposs how he will always be remembered. I appeal to anyone with information that could help police inquiries to come forward and speak to the case officers.  Mr Henderson who was a keen fisherman lived in a semi detached cottage in Upper Dovercourt, near Harwich, Essex. A -year-old man from the Harwich area and a -year-old woman from Ipswich were arrested on suspicion of murder soon after his death. The man was later was released under investigation while the woman from was released on police bail until July , pending further inquiries. A -year-old man from Ipswich, who was arrested later has been released on police bail until July . A post mortem by a Home Office pathologist found that Mr Henderson had died from a severe traumatic head injury. Neighbours of Mr Henderson said he was unmarried with no children, and loved to help people.  One neighbour said: I donapost know what connections he had with Ipswich so it is a mystery what he was doing there. He did not have a car and went everywhere by bicycle. He hardly ever went further afield than Harwich. Another neighbour Janice Clay, , said: He was a very friendly neighbour although he kept himself to himself. He helped us out when we first moved here three-years-ago and let us park on his drive. He was lovely. He was always here for everybody. We are now worried about his cat because he worshiped it. We donapost even know where it is. He didnapost have terrible mental health problems, but he did have issues with coping with work in the past. He didnapost have much money and he just lived day to day. Another woman living opposite his cottage said: He was the nicest man possible. He wouldnapost hurt anybody. He was just a lovely man.  I havenapost got a clue what he was doing down in Ipswich. I have no idea about why he went to that flat. He liked his fishing - any type of fishing. Thataposs all I can say to you. A man living two doors away said: He was a really nice guy who was always friendly, but he kept himself to himself. It is a real shame. He was always willing to give people a hand. I know that he used to work down at the port sometimes. I would always talk to him in passing. He never mentioned having any friends in Ipswich or anything, so it us all a bit of a mystery what he was doing there.

Vienna Hayers suffered a le-changing injury on Wednesday June , when she performed a flip on the trampoline at her home and landed badly. Her right arm took the full impact and after being rushed to hospital surgeons performed several operations to try and save her hand Her mum, Michelle Hayers, , said although doctors at Bedford Hospital in Bedfordshire fixed the injury to Viennaaposs bone, a week later she was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Doctors soon realised there was nothing more they could do. Viennaaposs body had stopped flowing blood to her right hand and the brave youngster had her hand, and the lower part of her arm, amputated. The talented young dancer, from Sharnbrook, near Bedford, has been left undeterred by her accident and is determined to get back to dancing as soon as possible. Primary school teacher Michelle said: Sheaposs just been incredible. Sheaposs been telling the doctors, aposThis is not going to stop meapos. Sheaposs very strong. I think Iaposve been drawing strength from her. After it happened she kept telling me, aposDonapost cry mummy, weaposre strong, weaposll get through thisapos. Vienna was right-hand dominant before so sheaposs having to adjust to using her left hand, but sheaposs been amazing.  Sheaposs been doing lettering, and has started taking the lids off yoghurt pots, and has been making keyrings for the nurses. I donapost think they can believe sheaposs only . Two separate fundraising pages have been set up to help raise money to aid Viennaaposs recovery - and, over the course of just five days, have raised a combined total of almost £,. Mum-of-two Michelle described the last few weeks as a rollercoaster. She said: The last few weeks have been le-changing. Weaposre still trying to process a lot of information. It really was just one freak accident. Sheaposs a very sensible girl, and a very confident and competent dancer. Sheaposs able to do tricks, but she knows her limits. She wasnapost doing anything outside of her limits. All it takes is just that one fall. Michelle, who is also mum to -year-old son Fin, added that the immediate aftermath to Viennaaposs accident was one of confusion. She said: Sheaposs never had anything more than chickenpox - weaposve never had to take her to the hospital before.  Then suddenly, within a couple of hours of the accident, sheaposs in theatre. Michelle added that Vienna is looking forward to getting back to her dance studio and on stage. Vienna started dancing ten years ago in the apostiny totsapos class at Bedford-based dance studio Elev Dance Academy - and before lockdown, she was doing  classes a week. One of the two fundraising pages for Vienna has been set up by her dance teachers at Elev, and has raised over £, in just three days to fund equipment to help Viennaaposs rehabilitation.The team at Elev wrote on their fundraising page : Vienna is a shining star who is determined in her recovery.She is a huge part of our dance school - an assistant in all of our baby classes, a soloist and group member on our competition team and most importantly a friend to everyone. Her shining smile is always on display and her enthusiasm is contagious. As her dance family, we all know the strength of character she possesses. If you have ever met Vienna at a festival, you will know that she always has a smile and aposwell doneapos for everyone. Any support you can offer toward her recovery and rehabilitation will go a very long way.

Even when she met tuk tuk driver, Priyanjana De Zoysa, she assumed he was just being nice when he asked for her mobile number and address. Despite the  year age gap between Diane and Priyanjana, when she ed home to Scotland the relationship between the pair really started to heat up. She was  when she met -year-old Priyanjana but Diane insists she was no Shirley Valentine, looking for love.Diane, now , told the Daily Record : I had a home, a good job, family and friends. But I didn’t have a great social le, was used to travelling alone, so I wanted a bit more out of le and was easily swept off my feet.She described Priyanjana as gentle and kind adding I couldn’t believe he was interested in me but he was very convincing. Diane explained: He tried to call but his English wasnapost good so he wrote me a few letters and we were texting each other. He mentioned marriage but I was a bit taken a back. I was  and I have never been married before. But the lure of paradise with a new man soon seduced Diane and seven months later she travelled back to Sri Lanka to see Priyanjana. This is when things really started to spiral out of control. Diane and her toyboy lover were at the register office for what she thought was a marriage licence, so when the registrar started to recite wedding vows, she was totally stunned. She said: I was shocked at first but he was urging me to go ahead with it and we got married. I didnapost have a ring or anything. At first Priyanjana was attentive and romantic towards his new bride and she sent him £, to start building work on a home for the newly weds. But when Diane sold her Edinburgh home for £,, she sent her new husband an additional £,. He used to money to upgrade his tuk tuk to a minibus to support the both of them and she moved to Sri Lanka. However, things were far from perfect in paradise for Diane, who was two years older than Priyanjanaaposs mum. She said: He was spending more and more time at his mumaposs house than with me or he would go out with his friends and he wouldnapost come home. The couple were also increasingly arguing about money and heartbroken Diane realised her marriage was a sham. It was then that Diane found Valentineaposs cards and gts from another woman and she realised that Priyanjana was also married to someone . She said: I felt betrayed. I thought he really loved me and thataposs why he had married me. It was obviously never going to work because it was to big an age gap. My friends tried to tell me but I wouldnapost listen But then things took an even darker turn. News that Priyanjanaaposs we had sold her house began to spread around the local community. This put them both in danger from criminal gangs, who told the couple their wealth meant they should be paying them protection money. When they refused - because Dianeaposs money was gone - one of Priyanjanaaposs family was killed. And then Dianeaposs husband was murdered, leaving her alone and trapped in Sri Lanka because she couldnapost afford her flight home. Both the house Priyanjana had built and the minibus he had bought were in his name so Diane had no right to sell them. After two years Diane, who had been living with Priyanjanaaposs family, had finally managed to save enough money to pay for a flight back to Scotland. She said: When I told them I was going they didnapost want me to leave because they were losing their cash cow.  Retired Diane has now been left with nothing after working hard all her le to save for her retirement. She said: said: Even before he died it wasnapost a great le and certainly not the way I imagined it would be when I moved to paradise. I gave up everything and I shouldnapost have done that but I really thought I loved him and I thought he loved me but he obviously didnapost.  Diane is now planning to launch legal action to try to reclaim some of the money she ploughed into her new le. She said: My two brothers-in-law and their wives and children are living in my home now rent-free. They don’t deserve to live there. That house was built on the work I put into my career over many years and I have nothing to show for it. That can’t be right. The -year-old was only able to leave Sri Lanka when she made a handful of friends online who helped her escape the country.

Time has stood still for the once bustling surgery with images showing the abandoned mansion littered with medical supplies, patient records and decaying surgical equipment. The dentist is understood to have died in the late s after suffering personal problems and the last cigarettes he smoked and the bottle of wine he drank are still laid out on the dining room table. The house, in a Belgian village, is like walking into a horror film - and not the sort of place youaposd want to get your teeth checked. The images are a spine-tingling reminder that the house was once a home and has now become popular with urban explorers. The pictures were taken by a British explorer at the weekend, who visited to record the houseaposs eerie contents. It is understood the dentist lost his licence in  and slumped into a depression, taking his own le three years later. But the house looks asit hasnapost been touched since at least the decade before. A waiting room lies tidy, waiting for patients to enter, while the old dentist chair is still in place, complete with dental moulds, newspapers from  and medical books stacked high alongside patient records.  The urban explorer who visited said: Itaposs a huge mansion behind these ft black metal gates and itaposs very, very sinister looking. The dentist lived there with his we and kids and he was a regular dentist and GP and he had it all in his house. He got into financial trouble and his we left him. I was told he also lost his medical licence but did not tell his patients.  He went on: The neighbours said he used to do appointments for a third of the price of anyone  but was using -year-old equipment and thataposs why people complained. Bedrooms are filled with perfectly clean and folded bedlinen while a chandelier hangs above one bed. Hundreds of items of clothing are crammed into wardrobes alongside shoes that seem to be from the s or s. But the eeriest thing at the mansion in East Flanders is the dentistaposs room.  There were drills and pain relief, with an alternative to chloroform, said the urban explorer. The basement was absolutely full of medical books. And there was a lot of beautul stuff left.

The Duchess of Sussex also for the first time named five friends who criticized her dad, Thomas, after the pair had a spectacular falling out in the lead up to her May  nuptials. In a series of statements made in legal papers submitted to the High Court, the -year-old claimed her wedding raised £billion in tourist revenue. The papers say this “far outweighed” the contribution of taxpayersapos money towards crowd security. This figure has been previously doubted by consulting firm Brand Finance, MailOnline reports, with a figure of £million closer to the mark. Meghan also says she was prevented from defending herself against reports concerning the acrimonious relationship with her father, which left her friends “rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant” . The former actress is suing Associated Newspapers Limitedowner of The Mail On Sunday newspaper over five articles, which included reproduced parts of a handwritten note she had sent to her father in August . Meghan claims her dad’s decision to make the letter public breached her privacy,and data protection rights. In a major development this evening it emerged in confidential papers that Meghan not only identied her pals who spoke anonymously to People magazine, but insisted she didn’t know they were doing so.  Meghan said she did not know about the interview having been given, and only found out about it, and any reference to the Letter, after the People magazine article was published. The friends have never been named, with the magazine only referring to them as “Meghanaposs inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante”. They are detailed as friends A, B, C, D and E in redacted documents but named in confidential papers submitted to the court. Meghan’s lawyers insist the Duchess “discussed with Friend A that she was writing a letter to her father at the time of penning itapos, which was seven months before the article was published in People in February .Legal experts predict the associates could now be called to testy in court during a sensational trial - dubbed “Markle versus Markle” expected at the end of the year or early . The documents state: As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself. At the beginning of May Associated Newspapers asked Mr Justice Warby to strike out the following allegations in Meghanaposs case: - That the defendant acted dishonestly and in bad faith. - That the defendant deliberately dug up or stirred up conflict between the claimant and her father. - That the claimant was distressed by the defendant’s “obvious agenda of publishing intrusive or offensive stories about [her] intended to portray her in a  and damaging light”.

The papers form part of The Duchess of Sussexaposs legal action against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline over articles which featured parts of a private and confidential handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. The relationship between the pair broke down completely when, during the wedding week, he was embroiled in controversy after allegedly being caught staging photographs with the paparazzi. In the documents, leaked last night and dated June , the former actress and humanitarian claims she spent her own money on hotels and flights to fly Mr Markle to and from London for her wedding. She also mentions Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie in the new submissions as she points out they undertake paid work. And she describes how her friends were concerned about her mental health while pregnant. Meghan, , who married Harry, , in May  and whom she shares one-year-old son Archie Harrison with, is suing Associated Newspapers over five articles, two in the Mail on Sunday and three on MailOnline. Here are the new court document claims... . aposMeghan had no idea about friendsapos People Magazine interviewapos In February , five of the Duchessaposs friends spoke anonymously to the US publication, People. The interview described the bullying the royal said she faced, and highlighted Mr Markleaposs letter. The document states: As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself. However, Meghan has claimed she did not know her friends would be speaking to People and was not aware of the contents of the article until it was published. The Duchessaposs five friends are not named in the documents but referred to as A-E, although they are identied in an undisclosed confidential schedule. The magazine only referred to the pals as being in “Meghanaposs inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante”. The report highlighted Meghanaposs handwritten letter to her father, with a confidant telling the American publication about its content.  The friend said: Sheaposs like, aposDad, Iaposm so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationshipapos. Meghan said she did not know about the interview having been given, and only found out about it, and any reference to the Letter, after the People magazine article was published. She was distressed when she read it. The documents state: She learned that an article about her was due to appear shortly before it was published. The Claimant [Meghan] was not informed that the article would be in People magazine, or what its contents would be. She was aware that her friends were deeply worried for her mental health as a result of her treatment by the UK tabloid media, particularly by the Defendant [Associate Newspapers]. The Claimant did not know that her Letter to her father would be referred to.  Meghan’s lawyers also state in the court filings that the Duchess “discussed with Friend A that she was writing a letter to her father at the time of penning it, which was seven months before the article was published. Friend A has been personally known to Mr Markle, a retired lighting director, for more than  years. Meghan phoned friend A after the article appeared to express her distress at its publication and contents, the court papers claimed. . aposFriends were worried about Meghanaposs mental healthapos The court documents state how at the beginning of , following visits by friends to see her in London, some of her close circle of friends became extremely concerned at the aggressive attacks upon her in the media. Meghan was told by one of her friends they were extremely worried about her mental health. It adds: Especially as she was vulnerable as well as heavily pregnant at the time. As a result, one of her closest friends decided that they should help by arranging to give anonymous interviews to this American magazine... The papers continue: As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself. . aposDidnapost state in letter she felt her father has victimised herapos  Meghan has also claimed she did not state in her letter that she felt her father had “victimised” her, nor did she state that she had “only one father” as People reported. Instead, the Duchess claims she raised concern that her father had consistently allowed himself to be manipulated by the tabloid media. The document reads: The Claimant did not state in her Letter that she felt her father had “victimised” her, nor did she state that she had “only one father” as is reported in the interview. Instead, she raised concern that he had consistently allowed himself to be manipulated by the tabloid media, despite her trying to persuade him not to speak to them for his own good, and rightly so. . aposMeghan told friends and members of Royal Family about letterapos  The legal papers also state that she had told friends and members of the Royal Family about the letter to her father. However, she had only discussed the contents with Harry, her mother Doria Ragland, two friends, the Kensington Palace Communications Team and her solicitor, she claims. The papers read: The Claimant requested the Letter to be sent via her trusted business manager , rather than from the UK address where the Claimant resided, in order to lessen the risk of the Letter being intercepted, and that a copy of the Letter be provided to her US lawyer for safe keepingon the understanding that he would not read its contents. This illustrates the s to which the Claimant went to keep the Letter private, as it was meant to be. . Meghan aposunprotected by the Institutionapos  In one of the more explosive claims, Meghan claimed to have felt unprotected by the institution of the monarchy. However, well placed Palace insider said last night: “It is clear Meghan is not pulling any punches in her pursuit of this trial. “The Royal Family will be absolutely dismayed at the assertion she was unprotected by the institution which is a bold claim. “The Queen, Prince Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge all went out of their way to make her feel welcome and will be hugely disappointed these allegations are being made so forcefully.” . Kensington Palaceaposs aposno commentapos  When People Magazine approached Kensington Palace for a comment on the interview they were told aposno commentapos. Meghan claims she was not asked for comment by the KP Communications Team in relation to this media inquiry or its subsequent dealings with the media. The documents state: The stance of aposno commentapos was taken by the KP Communications Team without any discussion with or approval by the Claimant, as is standard practice for Royal communications. Had the Claimant been asked or been given the opportunity to participate, she would have asked the KP Communications Team to say on the record that she had not been involved with the People magazine article, as she had not been. It continues: It was mandated by the KP Communications Team that all friends and family of the Claimant should say ‘no comment’ when approached by any media outlet, despite misinformation being provided to UK tabloids about the Claimant. This shared frustration amongst the Claimant’s friends left everyone feeling silenced, as it appeared that other so-called sources were able to disseminate  statements about the Claimant, while the people who knew her best were told that they needed to remain silent. The Claimant believes that it is probably because of this reason, as well as concerns about the press intrusion by the UK tabloids, that a few friends chose to participate and they did so anonymously. . Harry broke the news to Meghan about the People Magazine interview Meghan was informed of the article by Prince Harry immediately after he had been told by the KP Communications Team. Meghan initially did not know which of her friends had been involved and only found this information out some considerable time later, the court documents state. . Spotlight on Princesses Eugenie, Beatrice and Prince Michael of Kent  Princesses Eugenie, Beatrice and Prince Michael of Kent have also been named in the court documents. The Duchess was responding to a claim that Royal Family members donapost work when she singled out the two sisters and Prince Michael of Kent. The documents state: It is this denial by the Defendant which was gratuitous and wrong, as several ‘member[s] of the Royal Family’ do, in fact, ‘undertake paid work’ including, for example, Princess Beatrice of York, Princess Eugenie of York and Prince Michael of Kent. Meghan and Harry stepped down as senior members of the Royal Family earlier this year. At the time, the couple stated on their website they wanted to become financially independent. . Wedding aposwas not publicly fundedapos - and generated £b in tourism revenue  Meghan has stated that that at the time of the Articles being published she was a working member of the Royal family and to someextent publicly funded. The document states that any personal travel costs were always independently and privately funded by Meghan and Harry. It also claims the Royal wedding in May  at Windsor Castle was not publicly funded, but personally financed by Harryaposs father, Prince Charles. The document adds: Any public costs incurred for the wedding were solely for security and crowd control to protect members of the public, as deemed necessary by Thames Valley Police and the politan Police. This contribution of public funds towards crowd security was far outweighed by the tourism revenue of over one billion pounds sterling that was generated from the Royal wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex which went directly into the public purse. This figure has been previously refuted by consulting firm Brand Finance, MailOnline reports, with a figure of £million closer to the mark. . Meghanaposs communication with father  The legal filing states Meghan made many calls to her father during the week of the wedding, from Nottingham Cottage, as well as from wedding rehearsals and pre-wedding events in Windsor and from Windsor Castle, all of which were ignored or declined. It adds: The facts remain that: the Claimant called her father multiple times during the week of the wedding , that she did not change her phone number, nor block his number from calling her, that Mr Markle did not call or text the Claimant since the week of the wedding, and that he did suggest taking a photo in public with his daughter for the media. She denies blocking Mr Markleaposs phone calls after the wedding. . aposFive phone calls after Mr Markle had cardiac issuesapos Meghan claims once her father informed her via text message he was having cardiac issues, she phoned him on at least five occasions on th May at . on th May at . on th May at . on th May at . and on th May at .. She also states in the court filings she sent numerous texts, used Harryaposs phone to call her father, as well as using the Buckingham Palace switchboard. The court papers read: When Mr Markle publicly announced that he fell ill, the Claimant sent a security team to take him to hospital , and subsequently to go to his hospital to drive him home safely once he was discharged , as all her close friends and colleagues were already in transit to the UK for the wedding.  The court papers say: The Letter was not an attack on her father or intended as such. It was a private and deeply personal expression to him of her feelings and an attempt to remind him of some facts pertaining to their personal relationship. It adds: The stated intention of the Claimant in writing the Letter to her father was not because she felt he had victimised her but to seek to convey to him how he had allowed himself to be manipulated by the tabloid media, including the Defendant, despite trying to persuade him not to do so , and the impact which this had caused on their relationship, as well as on him, and, most importantly, how he should try to avoid it in the future. The intention of the Letter was to make him stop his actions it was not an attempt at reconciliation. This will be amplied in the Claimant’s witness statement. . Meghan paid for dadaposs flights and hotel accommodation for wedding  Meghan states in the court filings that made arrangements for and booked the flights to London and back for her father using her own money ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry. It also states in the legal filings that she made arrangements for him to have complete custom outfits for the wedding week including a morning suit and dinner suits. It adds that it entailed arranging an appointment with a professional tailor in Los Angeles for her father’s measurements to be taken - which he attended - and then for professional tailors in London and Canada to make the suitsso that they would be ready for him when he came over for the wedding. It claims she used a pseudonym so it would lessen the risk of media intrusion for him. The papers read: The Claimant took care to consider and to organise everything her father may need from all clothing items for each scheduled event, to accommodations, all transports, and a dedicated assistant on the ground to be with him during his time in the UK. Meghan also arranged for Mr Markle to stay at an apartment suite in the town of Brentwood in Los Angeles County for three nights ahead of his flight for the wedding but he would not get into the car” that had arrived to collect him. . Thomas Markle has never met Prince Harry or Archie The court documents confirm Thomas Markle has never met Prince Harry or the coupleaposs son, Archie - Mr Markleaposs grandson - in person. Mr Markle has had communication with Harry over the phone. Why is Meghan suing  The duchess is suing Associated Newspapers over five articles, two in the Mail on Sunday and three on MailOnline, which were published in February  and reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she sent to Mr Markle, , in August .  Meghan claims her dad’s decision to make the letter public breached her privacy,and data protection rights. She is seeking damages, which she has said will be donated to an anti-bullying charity, from Associated Newspapers for alleged misuse of private information,infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. What the Judge said in May Following a preliminary hearing in May at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Justice Warby struck out parts of Meghanaposs claim against the publisher, including allegations that it acted dishonestly by leaving out certain passages of the letter.

In a series of statements made in legal papers submitted to the High Court, the -year-old noted that the royal sisters retain their titles while working. The Duchess was responding to claims made in documents that she was a member of the royal family and does not undertake paid work”. Meghan questioned the suggestion by pointing to Beatrice and Eugenie, along with Prince Michael of Kent. The latter royal runs a consultancy business, while Eugenie worked at an online auction firm before becoming a director at the London art gallery Hauser  Wirth. Beatrice has worked at venture capital firm Sandbridge and later software company Afiniti, where she is currently employed as the Vice President of Partnerships  Strategy. Meghanaposs assertion was made as part of a lawsuit she is bringing against Associated Newspapers Limited , the owner of The Mail On Sunday newspaper and MailOnline. The former actress has raised issues with five articles, which included reproduced parts of a handwritten note she had sent to her father in August . Meghan claims her dad’s decision to make the letter public breached her privacy,and data protection rights. In a major development this evening it emerged in confidential papers that Meghan not only identied her pals who spoke anonymously to People magazine, but insisted she didn’t know they were doing so.  Meghan said she did not know about the interview having been given, and only found out about it, and any reference to the Letter, after the People magazine article was published. The friends have never been named, with the magazine only referring to them as “Meghanaposs inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante”. They are detailed as friends A, B, C, D and E in redacted documents but named in confidential papers submitted to the court.

Danielle Gardener is now a size  and says her weight gain has improved her mental health and most importantly improved her relationship with her children Noah, eight, and Leah, two. The -year-old social media influencer says her confidence was at an all time low as a size  as she aposdespisedapos herself which had a negative impact on her day-to-day le. She praises her own weight gain for benefiting her mental health and opening the door to modelling opportunities and says she is focused on her future and being a aposhappyapos mum. Danielle, from Hornchurch, Essex, said: I hated myself when I was slim as the negative comments from bullies such as aposuglyapos and aposfatapos chipped away at my confidence until I had nothing left. I thought I was fat and disgusting - I despised myself. I was depressed and angry at the world but now I feel so happy after embracing my curves. My relationship with my children has improved massively as Iaposm happy and I am always in a good mood and never let peopleaposs opinions bring me down. I want to build a career that makes them proud and show them that you are beautul, no matter what size you are. Kids pick up on everything andthey hear their mum putting herself down because of her appearance they are going to start questioning their own and I donapost want my children to ever feel like that.  I have stopped spending time worrying about my weight and now we are able to go to the beach or swimming without me worrying or hiding my body. We now have fun without limits and seeing them happy is all that matters. Danielle insists she is healthy and is not promoting obesity as she regularly exercises.She adds: I have been told I am promoting obesity but Iaposm not sitting on Instagram filling my face with fast food saying aposbe fatapos.Iaposm also not promoting diet pills or quick ways to loose weight that arenapost good for the body. I go to the gym four times a week, swim and eat a healthy balanced diet. Iaposm using my  to promote body positivity so other donapost feel like I did for all those years. My confidence didnapost grow overnight, it has taken almost two years for me to get to where I am today but I have never been happier. I look at photos of myself as a size  and remember how miserable I was but now I am bigger but in a much better place.  I used to hide from the camera but now I promote lingerie and bikini brands online - I am proud of my body and showing others, they should be too. Danielle feels there will aposalways be a fightapos about how a woman should look but thanks kind strangers online for positive comments and accepting her appearance. She said: There will always be pressure to look a certain way and there is still brands who wonapost use you or they want a plus size model who is a size  with a flat stomach.

Akira Gujadhur, , has a rare eating disorder that means she canapost eat anything other than bite-sized chunks of chicken. Her consultant at St Thomasapos Hospital in London even wrote a letter to KFC asking them to give the family a supply of frozen popcorn chicken to help get her through lockdown. Akiraaposs parents Raj and Hem spend thousands of pounds on buying her takeaways twice a day and Akira used to get them delivered at her old school. But the tot is due to start at a new school that specialises in teaching autistic children and staff wonapost allow the KFC meals on the premises. Mr Gujadhur said he has been left in the position where his daughter either starves at school or he quits his job so he can pick her up every lunchtime to take her to KFC. Akira has Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, which started after she suffered a severe throat infection at eight months old that stopped her eating. Doctors advised putting dferent foods in front of her until she selected something. She chose a piece of popcorn chicken and has refused to eat anything  since. She is given vitamins to ensure she gets sufficient nutrients. Her old school could no longer cater for Akiraaposs special educational needs so her parents secured her a place at Portfield School in Christchurch, Dorset. The Gujadhurs appealed the schoolaposs decision not to allow KFC on the premises but lost their case at a local authority tribunal hearing.  Mr Gujadhur, a senior actuarial analyst for finance firm Capita, said: We are very upset by how we have been treated. I think the school is acting so irresponsibly. Akiraaposs old school was a mainstream school and were feeding her the popcorn chicken with no problem at all. But it cost around £, a year and the local authority basically said food is not part of her educational needs so they could not pay for it anymore. Portfield School have said they are happy to offer her a place but donapost want her to eat popcorn chicken because itaposs fast food and they say she needs to eat healthily. I just donapost understand it because itaposs a specialist school for people like Akira who have additional needs. Akira canapost speak and she doesnapost understand.  The local authority is saying she canapost go to school without food but the school is saying she canapost eat the only thing she eats, at school. The tribunal seem to basically be saying itaposs the parentsapos problem. They are sayingwe feel she canapost stay at school without food, we will have to go every lunchtime, pick her up, feed her and bring her back. The school is  minutes from my work and weaposre not allowed to feed her at the school, weaposd have to take her KFC or take her home to feed her then bring her back. My we doesnapost drive and I canapost take hours out of work. The only alternative is to starve her at school. Theyaposre not being helpful at all. Weaposve got friends who have children there. One of them only eats sausages and she is allowed to bring sausages to school but they wonapost let Akira have popcorn chicken.  How can they force her not to eat the only thing she has been eating for the last five years  If they said she could eat at school we would be happy to pay for the deliveries and I donapost see how it would affect other children as once delivered it could be put into a lunchbox and look similar to any other lunch. The school doesnapost agree with takeaway food being brought into school or being eaten in front of other pupils. The school also raised concerns at the tribunal about the risk of allergens to other pupilsapos well-being. A spokesman for Portfield School, which is managed by Autism Wessex, said: At Autism Wessex, our top priority is the welfare and safety of all of our students and service users, and at no point would we allow any child or young adult to be put at risk of harm.

But behind the white painted mask of Marcel Marceau was a story he never wanted to tell. Unknown to his legions of fans, he saved the lives of more than  Jewish children from the Holocaust, risking his le to take them across the Alps from France into Switzerland. Marcel’s remarkable story is told at last in Resistance, a new film in which he is played by Social Network star Jesse Eisenberg. Director Jonathan Jakubowicz knew Marcel as the performer who changed modern theatre and even inspired Michael Jackson’s moonwalk. But he admits he knew nothing about Marcel’s most incredible achievement until he began researching his le before writing the script. Jonathan says: “I had no idea that he was Jewish or that he saved children in the war, that he found his art through the very act of saving children. I felt likethat is the story behind him it needed to be told. “I was going to the Cannes Film Festival so I felt like since I’m going to France maybe I can meet some of the people involved in that story.” Marcel died in France in , aged , but Jonathan tracked down his cousin Georges Loinger, who headed the Jewish Boy Scouts of France and Jewish Resistance during the war.  Jonathan says: “He was at the centre of this whole network that ended up saving , children. He was the man who recruited Marcel to the Resistance.” Born Marcel Mangel, he and his father, a kosher butcher, mother and younger brother lived in Strasbourg, France, on the border with Germany. But while they could see the growing Nazi threat from across the border, Marcel at first ignored the rumbles of war and the growing threat to German Jews, instead continued pursuing his ambition to be a theatre performer and playwright. Laughing off disapproval from his father, Marcel would mime in theatres with a toothbrush moustache prop that could transform him into Charlie Chaplin – and Adolf Hitler.  But that all changed in  when, during Kristallnacht, rioters across Germany destroyed Jewish businesses and killed Jews in the street, leaving hundreds of children orphaned. A wealthy Strasbourg landowner “bought”  children orphaned in the slaughter from the Nazis and took them across the border to live in her chateau. She turned to Georges for help, and he recruited his cousin Marcel – simply to entertain and soothe the traumatised children. Jonathan says: “The Jewish Boy Scouts get a phone call from the woman asking for their help. So this very small, unprepared group of boy scouts suddenly had to take care of  orphans. They’re crying, they’re desperate and they are traumatised.  “They only had Yiddish as the common language because the kids were German and Austrian and these guys were French.” There was a huge language barrier and that’s when Georges, who died in , decided to ask his cousin Marcel Mangel to help. To Georges, Marcel was a clown, a performer, a mime, an actor, an artist. He wasn’t taken seriously. Jonathan says: Marcel reluctantly agreed to help them, and I found it really beautul how he completely changes. He goes from being an egotistical human being to a person who is truly devoted to saving the lives of these children. Unable to communicate with words, Marcel began using mime to help put the children at ease, first with a simple gesture that would later make him famous – a hand passed over his face from happy to sad and back again.  He then found ways to make them laugh, include a walk-against-the-wind routine that would later become his signature. When Hitler invaded France in , Marcel and the Jewish Boy Scouts fled with the children to Lyon, hiding with families in the city. In , Klaus Barbie was made head of the Gestapo in Lyon. Known as the Butcher of Lyon, he delighted in torturing and murdering Jews, children and members of the Resistance. Marcel and his brother forged documents to change the ages of French youths to make them too young to be sent to labour camps or, in the case of the non-Jewish children, to work in German factories.  He also changed his own surname from the Jewish Mangel to the French Marceau. As Jews in the city started to be rounded up, the Jewish Resistance decided to get the orphaned children to safety in Switzerland. Marcel led the children across the Alps on three trips. He used his mime and clowning to calm them when their papers were checked by the Nazi soldiers. Jonathan says: “Growing up in Strasbourg he knew German, so he taught the children German songs. It helped that he could talk to the soldiers in their own language.  “He was incredibly courageous. Switzerland had this law that said they weren’t accepting refugees, butyou were a child refugee and you made it to Switzerland they wouldn’t report you because it was a neutral country. “Once they were there, Save the Children would claim them. It was a safe haven so the whole effort was to get them there without the Nazis stopping them.” Jonathan says: “Marcel was involved in three operations at the beginning but the rest of the operation of the Jewish Boy Scouts together with Save the Children saved , children.” Marcel’s father Charles was caught by the Gestapo and killed in Auschwitz in .  Jonathan says: “The most moving story I heard is that Marcel tracked down where his father was sent, but nobody knew what Auschwitz was. He would sit and wait for the train that came back from Poland to seehis father would come back from this place.” After the war, Marcel became the most famous mime in the world, creating Bip, a melancholy clown with a white face, striped jumper and battered hat with limp flower. After success on the US stage and television in the mid-s, he performed Bip internationally for decades. His work inspired numerous stars, from actor Gary Cooper to magician David Copperfield. Michael Jackson famously asked him to create “the choreography of my lost childhood” and Marcel’s sketch Walking Against the Wind inspired Jackson’s moonwalk.

Letaposs go! Iaposm enraged. Iaposm Jesus. Iaposm the descendant of God. Watch me go! as he begins to pick up speed. Iaposm getting stronger and stronger.The footage then shows police tasering him before pulling him out of the crashed car which he had reversed into -year-old Terry Radford as he went for a walk in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire Live reports.The footage captures the terrying end of -minute crime spree carried out by Collins, from Tibshelf, Derbyshire, on Good Fridaythis year. He had just been released from prison on a tagged curfew. On Wednesday he was jailed for le with a minimum tarf of  years for the manslaughter of Mr Radford by diminished responsibility. Under new legislation, the judge passed a discretionary le sentence, which means an offender can serve two thirds of a minimum term for a serious offence. In this case he set the minimum term of  years before he will be eligible for parole. The court heard Collins went to a neighbouraposs home, let himself in and took the car keys and the car. Dash cam footage caught Collins claiming to be Jesus while driving the car and shouting: Itaposs Good Friday, the real day. I am getting stronger and stronger. The footage, which has been released by Nottinghamshire Police, shows him driving dangerously towards Skegby where he crashes into a house.  He then gets out of the vehicle and approaches the owner of the house, who happens to be standing outside, and threatens him before trying to steal his car. A eagle-eyed driver pulls up to seeshe can help but when she winds her passenger window down Collins leans through, jumps into the car and pushes the woman out of her Corsa. It is . am when he sped off as police have started receiving reports that a vehicle was driving erratically up a pedestrian path around Manor Sport and Recreation Centre, Mansfield Woodhouse. When the Corsa got wedged on railings, Collins rushed to a nearby house where Nicola Cox was in the living room with her two sons, aged five months and four years.Collins smashed his way in with a patio slab and made a sign of a cross on the glass with his own blood before demanding Nicola hands over her car keys and threatened to kill her sons. He then took the keys and drew a cross in blood on the petried mumapos head and on her younger son. Moments later, Collins jumped into Nicolaaposs Seat Leon and reversed into Mr Radford. Collins then twice rammed a police car before driving off at high speed with the chase ending in a cul-de-sac where he crashed into a front garden and police tasered him.Mr Radford was a retired teacher having taught at Valley Comprehensive, now known as Outwood Academy Valley, Worksop, between  and . He was a former councillor of Mansfield Woodhouse in the s and s and a local magistrate from the s to . In a statement issued last year, paying tribute to Mr Radford, his family said: We’re absolutely devastated at the loss of the most wonderful dad and granddad who was loved and respected by everyone. He was the hub of our family. He was  but remained intelligent, articulate and funny. He was great company to be with and was as sharp as a pin.  He was extremely fit. Having looked after mum who had extreme dementia, and who we lost last September, he was finally getting his le back. He had three holidays planned for this yearincluding to the USA and a European river cruise. Now he won’t get to live out those dreams and his family and wide circle of friends won’t get to share more great times with him.Detective Inspector Becky Hodgman from Nottinghimshire Policesaid: This is a tragic set of circumstances that has obviously had a devastating and profound impact on Mr Radford’s family and friends."},{"url":null,"title":"two more places uk clearly","story":"NewsTwo more places in UK clearly of concern after coronavirus spikes, top scientist warnsProfessor Neil Ferguson says Doncaster and Bradford are both areas of concern after the Yorkshire town and city both saw a rise in the number of coronavirus cases amid fears they could face local lockdownsShareCommentsByJamie Hawkins:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video pm-says-new-leicester-lockdown-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news two-more-places-uk-clearly-\"\", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Imperial College Londonaposs Professor Neil Ferguson, who was a government adviser at the start of the pandemic, says it is only a matter of time until more places impose local lockdowns as Leicester has done following a spike of Covid- cases. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. And it is feared both Doncaster and Bradford could both see similar lockdowns following a worrying rise in the number of cases. Prof Ferguson told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Itaposs inevitable we will , we are relaxing lockdown rules and that means that contacts in the population are going up and thataposs a very iable process. Asked about Bradford and Doncaster, he said: Those are areas, where not as high as Leicester, but they have some of the highest numbers of cases per , of the population, which is the relevant measure, so theyaposre clearly of concern. Oxford Universityaposs Professor Peter Horby, who chairs the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group , also thinks England should expect more local lockdowns. Unfortunately I think we should, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Weaposve seen the epidemic is focal, which is often the case, itaposs not the same in all places. And we saw that London unfortunately led the way in the UK and now Leicester is unfortunately leading the way and we can expect more of that, so I think there will have to be local responses to local outbreaks.  Doncaster reported two more coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, taking the death toll in the South Yorkshire town to . Figures show there were  new  coronavirus  cases in Doncaster between June -, which more than doubled the following week. Between June -,  new infections in the town were confirmed, taking the total to . Doncaster was the only place in South Yorkshire to record new coronavirus deaths yesterday and is second behind Leicester as an area that has seen a worrying spike.  But, Dr Rupert Suckling, Director of Public Health at Doncaster Council, said he is not concerned about any potential lockdown in the town. “More data is now becoming available nationally and this will be open to scrutiny and speculation, he said. Since the reporting of both pillar  and pillar  testing we have seen a high number of positive cases beginning with the week th to st May and this coincided with widespread testing in our care homes where we identied a number of asymptomatic positive cases. We have also seen cases in health and care workers, with sporadic cases in schools. However, the weekly testing from the week th -th June shows a signicant reduction.  We are not complacent and encourage everyone with symptoms to self-isolate and arrange to be tested.

Between -mm of rain is expected to fall in just  hours ruining plans for those hoping to enjoy a pint in a beer garden. Saturday morning will start off with strong winds and downpours before becoming heavier throughout the day and eventually easing off in the evening. The news comes as pubs, bars and restaurants across England will be allowed to reopen on Saturday after the government ordered them to close on March  to stop the spread of coronavirus.But the wet weather means pubs will struggle to adhere to social distancing measures as drinkers stay inside to avoid being drenched.Coronavirus infection rates are believed to be higher in inside spaces.Despite the rain England will remain humid, with maximum temperatures of C in London and the South East, and highs of C in central and northern parts of England. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said this is due to a low-pressure weather system near the UK, and although the rain will lessen towards the end of Saturday, low cloud and drizzly conditions will continue through to Sunday.She said: Saturday will see more unsettled conditions, with showers beginning in the west during the morning which will begin to move across to the east. While it wonapost be unusually wet for the time of year, some areas in the east could become particularly heavy for an hour or two in the mid-morning to early afternoon. Pushing in after that will be a spell of drizzly downpours and some low cloud which will hang over the UK for the rest of the day. A spokesman from JD Wetherspoon, which plans to reopen all  of its venues on Saturday, said: The weather is out of our control, but our pubs tend to be three times larger than others so we are not worried about people being inside our venues. We canapost predict what the weather will be like in England, but we have faith that our customers and staff will be as safe as possible.  A spokesperson for Stonegate Pubs, which owns The Slug and Lettuce chain, added: Throughout our pubs and bars, we are implementing clear, safe socialising measures both inside and across our outside spaces. We are encouraging customers to pre-book and all bookings work on a time-limit which enables us to manage capacity and customer expectation.

The  GTO, built between  and , is the firmaposs most iconic model, raced in period by the biggest names in motorsport. Only  were built and they are regarded as the aposHoly Grailapos of cars, with only the super-rich able to afford the £million-plus asking price they command on the classic car market. Ferrari had the shape trademarked, but the Italian sports car company has lost the right following a legal battle against a bespoke car manufacturer from the same city of Modena. Ferrari have, however, maintained the trademark for making toy vehicles. Ares Design took Ferrari to the Cancellation Division of the European Union Intellectual Protection Office, arguing Ferrari had not put the contested trademark to genuine use for a continuous period of five years. According to EUIPO documents, lawyers acting for Ares Design said the trademark - which Ferrari has held since  - had been filed in bad faith, namely, as a defensive mark in order to block third parties to produce and sell similarly built sports cars. At the centre of the case was aposArticle  EUTMRapos, where a European Union trademark can be revoked , within a continuous period of five years, the trademark has not been put to genuine use.This aposuse it or lose itapos argument was the same point used last year by Irish fast food chain Supermacs when it successfully fought McDonaldaposs over the trademark aposBig Macapos. Ares Design argued that Ferrari had not put the contested design to use since  and that when they filed for the EU trademark in , they had no intention to use it. Despite protestations from Ferrari, the EU sided with the applicant, potentially paving the way for other companies to build copycat vehicles or modern interpretations of the Ferrari  GTO. In the published decision, the report stated: In the present case, the Cancellation Division considers that genuine use of the contested EUTM has been sufficiently demonstrated for the relevant factors in relation to toy vehicles, scale-model vehicles, whereas no use of the mark or proper reasons for non-use have been demonstrated in relation to any of the other goods in Class for which it is registered.

He is a victim of this global pandemic.“It is a tough one for me and the players but it is even tougher for Jimmy and Cammy, who has also left the club.“It is an absolute gutter for the two of them. But no one could have predicted how this virus would affect clubs like ours.”The Dark Blues are all but certain to promote first-team coach Dave Mackay to take over as number two but no decision has been made yet.McPake made the point that he has other things on his mind right now.“I think it is too early to say what will happen,” said McPake.“Thatis not what’s in my head just now.“What I am thinking about is losing members of staff due to cost-cutting measures.”McPake yesterday confirmed he will not be involved in pay cut talks between the club and its players.The Dark Blues’ squad members have been asked to agree to salary reductions of around % and while Meekings said no and headed off to pastures new, experienced midfielder Paul McGowan has gone the other way and agreed to stay.McPake stressed it will be up to iniduals to do what is best for themselves and their families, and the pay discussions will be done at managing director level by John Nelms.He said: “I can confirm that there have been talks about deductions but that’s for iniduals and that’s way above me.“That’s something that I am not really involved in and, evenI were, it wouldn’t be fair for me to speak about as we are talking about people’s livelihoods and salaries.“Cuts have been offered but what each inidual’s cut is, that’s private between them and whoever is dealing with it at the club.“It will just be inidualised. Theymay come back to the club with dferent ideas, I don’t know.“They might all come back and say yes or they might say no. It is a tough one for me to predict and, as for a deadline, I genuinely don’t know.”Askedthe coaching staff had also been asked to take a pay cut, the Dens boss replied: “That’s not something I will go into.”As for Meekings, there were definitely no hard feelings towards the defender from his now former gaffer.McPake added: “Meeks is gone and that’s a shame because he did great for me as captain of this club.“He was offered a deal and it was his choice to say whether it was acceptable or not.“He chose to reject it but I wish him well for the future.“It is sad to see him go but I fully understand decisions that people make, particularly under the circumstances we are in with the pandemic.“I have no bad words to say about him at all.”On a brighter note, McPake was understandably upbeat regarding McGowan’s decision to say yes to his new terms.He said: “I am delighted that he committed himself to the club.“Gowser is a leader without even realising he is a leader.“He might moan a lot on the pitch at times but that is because he has high standards and he is often the one to express an opinion when he thinks the players are not hitting those high standards.“At times like these, you need people with character at your club and Gowser certainly has that.“He never shirks responsibility and that is why he has such real affinity with the Dundee fans.“I think the talks with him were over and done within a day or so. That shows you how keen he was to stay.”Talks between Dundee and prominent fans# group over a cash injection have collapsed\" title\"#Talks between Dundee and prominent fans# group over a cash injection have collapsed# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp talks-dundee-fans-group-cash-injection-have-collapsed embed # secretVmrceFxkXP\" data-secret\"VmrceFxkXP\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

For example, as well as linen and towel changes, our teams will freshen all in-room amenities for new guests – from toiletries to tea and coffee to the addition of packs of antibacterial wipes.#And we’ll keep rooms free of non-essential items but will still have these to hand on request. We’ll even be including welcome packs in each room for guests, with hand sanitiser and PPE.“We also recognise that, particularly in the current circumstances, plans can change quickly, so we’re making a flexible booking rate available to allow free last-minute cancellations, and we continue to offer the best available rates to those booking direct via our website.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He really liked the club and the region where the club are based. It was just a good fit between the club and Steve himself.#Our area in Holland is full of people who are down to earth and Steve loved that. He#d gone from the pressure of getting the sack from England and all the attention that carried with it, to a small region in the east of Holland which is very quiet and he relished that.#The club was well run and well organised. You can ask anyone in Enschede and they all have nothing but positive things to say about Steve.#Hopefully, it will be the same with him and Dundee United too.#Brama says McClaren wouldn’t go into Tannadice and make wholesale changes – and he raved about the former Middlesbrough manager#s man-management skills.He recalled: #Steve had two periods with us as manager and, of course, he won us the league for the first time in our history in his first time at the club.#Him being manager made it a very, very positive experience for me.#When he first came in, the important thing for him was not to change everything straight away. In the beginning, he didn#t change a lot of things, he just observed.#He also didn#t bring in his own coaches, he kept the very good Dutch coaches we had at the club. He had Erik ten Hag, who is now Ajax manager, at the club as a coach and Alfred Schreuder as his assistant manager, who went on to manage Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga.#So he used the coaches who were there and their knowledge and allowed the coaches here to do their job without interference and that certainly helped too.#He was a great manager for us. He was liked and respected by the players, coaches, everyone at the club in a very good way. He was the boss and everyone knew it.#For me as a player, he was fantastic. I was out of the team when Steve arrived because there were two new players who were in my position.#But he played me in a game against Arsenal in Europe when he needed a more defensive midfielder and I played just about every game since then.#He could trust me. I was only  at the time and I liked that he showed enough confidence in me as a young player to discuss tactics with me.#It was a very Dutch way to work and it was another example of how he adapted. He wanted to integrate with the Dutch way of playing, training and thinking and that#s what made him a big success.#Hopefully, he will be as big a success at Dundee United as he was at Twente.#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-malky-mackay-dundee-united embed # secretlLVCwFjUQ\" data-secret\"lLVCwFjUQ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

receiving unwanted attention left Tourettersquos sufferer and former Peebles High School pupil Jack OrsquoHara with severe anxiety and depression.As the son of a retired police officer and a bank cashier, his le would be relatively normal without Tourette syndrome, a neurological disorder which affects around one in  children and young people in the UK.Now a first-year Scottish history student at the University of Edinburgh, Jacks memories of growing up with Tourette syndrome are still agonisingly fresh.Speaking to the Border , -year-old Jack said: ldquoMy earliest memory of facing adversity was in primary two, when I had a problematic teacher.ldquoShe didnrsquot believe that I had Tourettersquos ndash she thought I was acting up for attention.The memories of being ridiculed at such a young age evidently still haunt Jack today.He said: ldquoI remember the teacher showing me up and making me look like a fool in front of the class.\"When the teacher laughed, my classmates laughed too.As a youngster, Jack also exhibited bursts of impulsive behaviours ndash on occasions, he would run out onto the middle of the road towards oncoming traffic.After countless visits to his GP, and being wrongly diagnosed with ADHD and autism, he was eventually confirmed as having Tourettersquos at the age of seven.Nearly  per cent of people who seek treatment for Tourettersquos will be diagnosed with a second psychiatric disorder during their letimes, according to researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital.Due to the complicated nature of the syndrome, misdiagnoses are common, and the process of finding a correct diagnosis for Jack took several years.And although the rest of his school days were slightly easier and his school was cooperative, Jack faced other issues.Undertaking a series of drug trials from the ages of eight to , he lost three stone in a year ndash making him dangerously underweight.ldquoThe medication made me feel so low and lethargic all the time and came with horrendous side effects,\" he said.ldquoI had no personality and was reduced to skin and bone.\"One gave me breasts, and one made me drool all the time.A  study in Biological Psychiatryrevealed that Tourettersquos sufferers are four times more likely than the general population to die by suicide, with mental health problems having a ldquosevere impact on their daily lives.With the constant attention being directed towards him due to his physical and vocal tics, Jackrsquos own mental health took a turn for the worse during secondary school.When using public transport, Jack would always sit at the back to avoid all eyes being on him.Most of his tics are quite physical, which meant his anxiety would sky-rocket when he was out in public.After being diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and depression, even leaving the house became too much at times.ldquoTourettersquos infiltrates every part of your le, Jack said.ldquoIt got to the stage that every time I left the house, I would come back crying because of bullying or horrible comments.ldquoMy main problems arenrsquot because of my tics. Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"find-man-king-street","story":"HAILED by their neighbours as the gardening ldquoKing and Queen, a Peebles couple have spent decades transforming the grass verges on their street into an attractive wildle haven.lsquoIf you want something done right, do it yourselfrsquo ndash an age-old adage that was brought to le by Brian Elliot and his we Lynne.The King of Kingsway, , moved to the street in .When Scottish Borders Council stopped cutting the steep grass banking outside his home, he and his neighbour Billy Duncan rolled up their sleeves and got on with the job.That was  years ago, and Billy has since moved, but green-fingered Brian continues to develop the plantation garden, with many comparing it to the beauty of Dawyckrsquos botanical garden.If the display were in the running at the prestigious RHS Cha Flower Show, judges would go wild for the attractive shrubs and nectar-rich flowers, which grab the attention of bees and butterflies.But Kingswayrsquos Monty Don has not only created a garden that is pleasing to the eye, he has also built a home for wildle.ldquoOver the years Irsquove planted a iety of shrubs, trees and bushes and flowers and put bark down,\" he said.\"Itrsquos a great habitat for insects which encourages birds.\"We get lots of butterflies, bees and itrsquos a wee haven for hedgehogs.\"Itrsquos just lovely hearing the birds singing and the bees buzzing.\"The -year-old says his nature reserve is appreciated by many in the town.Having created the garden and maintained it for  years, we asked Brianit is a labour of love.He laughed: ldquoI donrsquot like gardening ndash itrsquos a chore.\"At least thatrsquos what I tell people when they stop to speak.\"Neighbours and locals passing by do appreciate it, which makes it worthwhile.The garden, which spans over  metres, hasnrsquot cost Brian an arm and a leg ndash just his big toe!ldquoIt was  years ago.

have seen large gatherings of youths, sometimes more than  at a time, at ious locations around the county.The vast majority of these are all well behaved but a small minority have been engaging in signicant anti-social behaviourand disorder.North Berwick, Tranent and Longniddry have caused us some issues recently, with intoxicated youths verbally abusing passers-by, vandalising items, smashing bottles and leaving a mess behind. This is not acceptable.East Lothian Countryside Rangers have reported a signicant rise in rubbish, empty alcohol bottles, broken tents and ious other items on our beaches and parks.When you visit the coastal areas, you expect it to be clean, tidy and safe, and the Rangers do an exceptional job keeping up with the disgusting mess left behind.However, what they are now regularly cleaning up is way beyond what should ever be expected.During a clear up at Longniddry Bents last week,  canisters of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, were found discarded, along with hundreds of empty alcohol bottles. This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with.

with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate, these are the local

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Marianne Taylor  We   re all public health guinea pigs now    but that   s just the way it has to be","story":"Irsquove also started planning a wee holiday up north and have booked a hairdressersrsquo appointment. Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

But Sir Keir Starmer and others who believe that such comments are anti-Semitic are implying that because of being Jewish, I am somehow implicated. Indeed the belief that Jews in general are somehow associated with Israel and are under attackthe actions of the Israeli State are attacked is itself anti-Semitic. Anti-Semitic and racist, because it implies that the ethnicity of someone Jewish, not their citizenship, or their own views on the world is their defining characteristic, and that this ethnicity necessarily associates them with Israel.So, Sir Keir, please desist: I do not want whatever Israel and its agents are up to be laid at my door.I would add that those who most detest some of what Israel is up to, such as Maxine Peake, are the least likely to be at all racist in outlook.

This is a far less serious matter than his becoming Cabinet Secretary. It has few,any, constitutional implications. I worked for a previous incumbent for a couple of years. It is an extremely important role but, as its name suggests, it is primarily advisory ndash and also a kind of personal envoy from the Prime Minister to counterparts overseas. That could be work for a trusted political appointee.:Agenda: Proposed new law could make JK Rowling a criminalIs it a good appointment  That is a more subjective question, and less fundamental. Mr Frostrsquos predecessors have been very senior diplomats, with deep grounding across Britainrsquos foreign policy and security concerns ndash former heads of the Diplomatic Service, Ambassadors in Washington, Paris, Permanent Representatives in Brussels, both to the EU and to Nato. Some have done more than one of these big jobs, in wide, senior international careers.Mr Frost is able and, importantly, has the Prime Ministerrsquos confidence. But his diplomatic career culminated in the important, but not central, ambassadorship to Denmark. He then ran the important, but not central, Scotch Whisky Association, and was special advisor to Mr Johnson, as a Foreign Secretary who earned mixed reviews. Judging Mr Frostrsquos role as chief Brexit negotiator may be premature. But it is odd, after the justied criticism of Sir Mark Sedwillrsquos being both Cabinet Secretary and National Security Adviser, that Mr Frost should have to combine the climax of Brexit negotiations with whatever Middle Eastern politics, for instance, or terrorism, may serve up in the coming months.Choosing the new Cabinet Secretary matters more.

Over the last  years, as government has grown, so has the Cabinet Secretaryrsquos role as a constitutional .

They know about Parliament, the economy, cross-Whitehall management, and political and media realities. With a mainly diplomatic background, Mark Sedwill has lacked his predecessorsrsquo grounding in our curious constitution: this must have been a challenge. Eventhose appointing his successor want a revolution in Whitehall, it would be goodhe or she thoroughly understands the constitutional arrangements to be overhauled, within which crises are bound to happen. Not least, in an increasingly scandal-prone world, the Cabinet Secretary should have a neutral authority to make judgments on erring ministers and officials that command respect across the political and public scene.

They might agree with her, too, that feminism has tended to look down on womenwho choose to stay at home and care for children rather than join the  to .Admittedly, it can sometimes feel as though the only gains to have been made in feminism are surface ones, easily erased when times get tough. It has often been that way: see the two world wars.

If this is progress it looks dishearteningly modest.Yet I also see the likes of the #MeToo movement and think of old Harvey behind bars. I see women going to court to enforce their employment rights. I see them speaking up, determined not to take the same sexist nonsense we often did. Saying you are not a feminist today is distinctly uncool.

Savills should snap her up.Scotlandrsquos Home of the Year, which reached its final last night, opts for a more traditional, middle of the road, mode of snooping.Back for a second series after its successful debut last year on the new BBC Scotland channel, SHOTY ndash as it is known to fans much in the way Coronation Street is Corry ndash sends an architect , an interior designerand a lestyle bloggerto run their collective eye over  properties around Scotland, eventually selecting nine for the final and one eventual winner.The finalists met the judges at the House for an Art Lover in Bellahouston Park. One wondered what Charles Rennie Mackintosh would have made of it all.From a grand Georgian townhouse in Edinburgh to a dinky cottage near Pitlochry, taking in renovated this, that and the other along the way, I like to think CRM would be tickled at the obvious love of design on show.He would probably be just as annoyed as the viewers at the endless wittering of the judges.Goodness but those three can bang on about not very much. Watery patter is just about acceptable in a -minute show, but the final was an hour and the strain showed.To pad things out, the presenters were sent to notable homes that were now museums, which was as exciting as it sounds.All we wanted, viewers and contestants alike, was a last trot through the finalistsrsquo gaffs, some low level snarking, and a winner selected.Usually, SHOTY comes up short on the snarking. This has to one of the most determinedly ldquonice shows on TV. The contestants are nice. ldquoEveryonersquos house is so beautul, I donrsquot think anyone would mind who won because everybody deserves to, said one. The judges are nice, too.That wonrsquot do for a final, however, when tough decisions have to be made.Maybe it was the confidence that comes with a second series, but the judges were definitely taking some baby steps towards a more critical approach.When Spiers described one home as ldquoa bit staged the other two gasped at her daring, but the gloves were off after that. The three are becoming more relaxed together, which helps.The last series lacked drama because the winner was so obvious from the start. This year the honours were more evenly spread, and it was heartening that the best looked like real homes you could eat a fish finger sandwich in instead of something straight out of a glossy mag.But from first sight the grand flat in Park Terrace, Glasgow, was head, shoulders and hand-gilded cornicing above the rest. The awestruck judges spent their visit speaking in hushed tones, as though they were in a place of worship.Campbell-Jones was so taken by the gorgeous colours, the sumptuous fabrics, and general attention to detail on display she cried. If I had to dust all those photo frames Irsquod cry too.No surprise that the owner of Park Terrace, Hugh Berry, was an interior designer and gilder by trade.No surprise either that a third series of SHOTY has been commissioned for .

They have to have continued access to priority delivery slots and guarantees that they can get essential groceries when they need them.ldquoWe recognize the work done by supermarkets at the start of the crisis to help customers, but it appears that some of the most vulnerable older people are still not getting the service they so desperately need. We look to the Scottish Government to work with the retailers to come up with a solution as a matter of urgency.The research uncovered what was described as an \"alarmingly mixed picture\" with similar issues to Scotland in Wales, whle just one in four in England registered food issues and two in five in Northern Ireland.The study found that in Scotland well over a thirdwere relying on friends and familyand supermarket deliveriesto get food and essential groceries.

The help should be extended to include not only the most-high risk but also those who are situationally vulnerable and have so far been sidelined.This would mean that central and local governments will need to accurately assess and identy which consumers remain vulnerable so that they can also be given access to appropriate support such as priority supermarket delivery slots or local food provision through other means.:Edinburgh womanwho has battled cervical cancer and brain tumours fronts new UK-wide Cancer Research fundraising appealSue Davies, head of consumer protection and food policy at Which  said:ldquoIt is a real concern that months into lockdown, the current system of food provision is still not working for so many of those who need it the most. Some people could now be looking at a clf edge where shielding restrictions are lted and they are left to fend for themselves, cut off from outside help in getting essential groceries.ldquoWhich  is now calling for the UKrsquos four governments to work with the food industry, local authorities and charities to ensure a longer-term plan for supporting all of those who are at risk and need support is in place by the end of July, so that no vulnerable person faces dficulties in accessing the basic food supplies they need.Commenting on research by Which  showing vulnerable people in Scotland are struggling to access food supplies, Scottish Labour MSP Elaine Smith said: ldquoThese concerning findings raise serious questions about both the UK and Scottish Governmentrsquos handling of the emergency response to the pandemic.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield.Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world.“A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’.“We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.“We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised £, in the end.“We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.”Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running.Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS.“It was worth shy of £m and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.”So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.Read about more inspiring GREAT stories at greatbritaincampaign inspirationscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From helping to build Nightingale Hospitals to delivering essential supplies to those who are shielding, they have helped thousands of people across the country. We take a look at how one such veteran is helping out.This is not the first time former soldier Joshua Ryder has seen a pandemic close up, having volunteered to visit Sierra Leone during the West African Ebola virus outbreak. The -year-old worked in what was known as a “red zone” in Kerry Town,  miles from capital Freetown.As a member of Royal Army Medical Core, he worked as a combat medical technician, receiving awards for Top Trainee and Adult Learner of the Year.Joshua said: “We treated patients with confirmed or suspected Ebola. The symptoms are similar to those of malaria and gastroenteritis. “We triaged and tested patients to determine whether they had these or Ebola.”The West African outbreak began in , ending in Sierra Leone in .Two-and-a-half years after the first case was discovered, the outbreak resulted in more than , cases with , deaths. vw, px\"  Such was the volatility of the strain – most widespread outbreak of the disease in history – Joshua was only allowed to work in the area for  days.He said: “I loved the country. It has some beautul sights and the people are really friendly. “It was sad to see the devastation caused by the pandemic. We didn’t only focus on the pandemic. We visited orphanages and helped build something for the country.“It was moving to see the children who lost their parents to the virus.”During the coronavirus outbreak he is again working, but the environment could not be more dferent.Having left the army in , he is now a trainee nursing associate on a Midlands Partnership NHS Trust acute mental health ward in Stafford.Joshua, who is father to Tia, aged , and her -year-old sister Lola, said: “Day to day I am more involved with the physical well-being of the patients – calming them, making physical observations, doing ECGs and bloods. “I go to Keele University one day a week and am due to start my second year in September.”It was Joshua’s experiences and expertise in the army that led him to the NHS in general, and mental health in particular.He said: “I have worked in demanding conditions in ious locations around the world. I am adaptable to suit many environments and job roles.” vw, px\"  In the military he saw firsthand soldiers suffering poor mental health. One of his friends, also serving in the army, committed suicide.He said: “I entered the NHS through the Step into Health programme, which has been brilliant.“I have been able to prove myself and have had really positive feedback.“I won an award for Outstanding Impact Since Joining the NHS at the programme’s first ceremony.”Joshua is helping to treat patients through more dficult times than usual.“We are doing absolutely brilliantly,” he said. “It would be abnormal, with all the constant changes,we did not experience stress and anxiety.“We have adapted and made changes.“Here our patients have been brilliant.“We have got a good team here, a good mix of people with dferent skills. We all support each other and do everything we can for our patients.”Joshua has also been a volunteer with men’s mental health charity Men Unite, supporting males in crisis.He ran a half marathon last year to raise £ for Mental Health UK.“And this month I am running  miles, having so far raised £ for the same charity through JustGiving.” he said.Former service personnel have helped dferent communities deal with all manner of problems, making urgent deliveries of food and medicines to vulnerable people while also helping those who are shielding receive what they need.Many others have helped ensure those who need a test for the virus have been able to get one by setting up mobile testing sites, allowing them to run smoothly and safely to daily test thousands of people with symptoms.A lot of this work has required specic skills our veterans have learnt throughout years of military service.The work of these veterans goes to show the military gives you key skills, transferable to civilian le – be it healthcare, business or organisation.Veterans form an important part of our NHS workforce and, throughout COVID-, many more have come forward to support the continued fight against this pandemic.Working across a iety of roles, both on and off the frontline, the NHS has benefitted from their military expertise and experiences, invaluable at this challenging time.From redesigning hospital departments to safely supporting virus and non-virus patients, to providing care for those in Nightingale Hospitals and supporting nurses using military mental health resilience techniques, vets have once again served our country with pride.This is in addition to many who have continued to work in dedicated NHS services for ex-service personnel, such as Veterans’ Mental Health Transition, Intervention and Liaison Service and Veterans’ Mental Health Complex Treatment Service to ensure care and treatment remains available throughout this period, virtually or via phone. vw, px\"  Minister for Defence People and Veterans Johnny Mercer, pictured right, said: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. “We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, ideas such as an offshore wind farm east of Shetland, and the creation of hydrogen from natural gas or electrolysis, are some of the ideas being suggested.Smaller scale community projects would also be developed through the hub project.Mr Irvine#s report to the council said the hub could generate pound billion of revenue for the region, remove carbon emissions by eight million tons, and create , jobs.He said the formative phase would look at which options are viable commercially and which were not.While the council has already committed pound, to the project, Mr Irvine said funding from the Scottish and UK governments as well as the Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be needed.He also said private sector investment was ldquocore to the project ndash and a steering group was working on that.Lerwick North councillor Stephen Leask had questioned how strong the council#s position # and how much financial risk it could face.Mr Irvine said most of the risk would be taken by the major investors from the energy industry, rather than the SIC.Martyn Tulloch, who leads the Net Zero Solution Centre, at OGTC, told the meeting that while other regions were advancing hub projects, with one in Humberside said to be the furthest advanced, he was not aware of any that had received Scottish government funding.#We have been approached by other regions but this is very much our sole focus at the moment,# he added.SIC leader Steven Coutts said the hub was a #crucial# project to Shetland#s future # and one that the council could not progress alone.He added it would need to bring #signicant community benefits# .#We want to see people thrive in Shetland with a strong and resilient community,# he added.Councillors agreed to progress the project into its #formative phase#, which will see the project team work with the energy industry and government agencies to identy next steps, including research projects and trials.Consultations will also take place with the community, businesses and other relevant interestsA funding application is expected to be submitted to the Scottish government next month...Police are appealing for the publicrsquos help to trace a man missing from his home in Lerwick since the early hours of Thursday nd July#.People will soon have to wear masks when visiting the shops in Shetland, the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced today.

This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows. Eagle, two under parpts: birdie, one under parpts, parpts and bogey, one over parpt.This form of play is very popular as a very high score on one or two holes doesn#t ruin the player#s chances of winning as would be the case in medal or strokeplay competition.Generally speaking the better players prefer the former while the rest of us favour the latter!Par is the score expected to be recorded on the hole by a #scratch# player and is determined by the number of shots the player should take to reach the green then add on two for putts.A par can be three # one shot plus two putts four # two shots plus two putts or five # three shots plus two putts. .

DaoineThe study of areas like Staffin, Tiree and the Western Isles has been labelled as the most comprehensive social survey on the state of Gaelic communities ever conducted.The findings conclude that the language is in crisis, and that within remaining vernacular communities of Scotland the social use and transmission of Gaelic is at the point of collapse.Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands Language Sciences Institute and Soillse, a multi-institutional research collaboration which includes Sabhal Mòr Ostaig in Skye, outline the findings in a new book published todayThe authors of ‘The Gaelic Crisis in the Vernacular Community: A comprehensive sociolinguistic survey of Scottish Gaelic’ urge a radical new agenda and strategy for Gaelic revitalisation in the islands.They argue for the creation of a community development trust for Gaelic-speakers that is island based and under the direct control of the community.Professor Conchúr Ó Giollagáin, Professor of Gaelic Research at the University of the Highlands explained the motivation behind the new book.He said: “It is important that we are clear about the immense scale of the challenges involved in reversing the ongoing decline in the use of Gaelic in these areas.“Our statistical evidence indicates that the Gaelic vernacular community is comprised of around , people, of which a majority are in the  years and over age category.“The decline of the Gaelic community, as especially shown in the marginal practice of Gaelic in families and among teenagers, indicates that without a community-wide revival of Gaelic, the trend towards the loss of vernacular Gaelic will continue.“We found a mismatch between current Gaelic policies and the level of crisis among the speaker group which must be addressed to face the urgency of the language loss in the islands.“The primary focus of Gaelic policy should now be on relevant initiatives to avert the loss of vernacular Gaelic.”In order to make Gaelic policy viable, the researchers called for a re-aligning of national policy to address the decline in the use of Gaelic as a community language.Whilst some elements of national policy have had some success, such as the numbers of primary pupils in Gaelic Medium Education, without an overarching revitalisation approach, as outlined in their research, the authors believe the decline in the Gaelic vernacular community will rapidly continue.Iain Caimbeul, research fellow at the Language Sciences Institute in the University of the Highlands and Islands added: “If Scotland is to continue to give practical expression to its commitment to sustaining cultural ersity, it is vital that strategy for the Gaelic group is rooted in the broader context of community revitalisation.#We hope this research will be valuable to those interested in seeking to sht public policy assumptions from a sole dependence on the school system for creating the next generation of fluent Gaelic speakers.“It is vital that we change the basis for allocating resources to protect against further decline.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience

successful running of the ‘machinery’ of administration we all take for granted.Maybe I was naive to expect we’d all be on the same ‘side’, trying our collective best to maximise the opportunities for

of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it comes to golf, what you see is generally what you get.At Stornoway last week what we got was decent weather and decent scoring.In the Lewis Cup on Wednesday night, Stuart ‘Tyson’ Campbell triumphed

Inside was a large framed photograph of Noah and his mother Fiona, showing both of them smiling, with the St Malachy#s school crest above it. A black and green ribbon - the colours of St Malachy#s - was tied to the handle of the white coffin. After Mass the cortege, which was en route to Roselawn cemetery, made a brief stop at the Antrim Road college, where Noah, described in the homily as someone who carried his potential so lightly and so humbly, was a Year  student.Pupils and teachers lined the avenue leading up the school to pay their respects.Outside, a large crowd had gathered making social distancing dficult.The gates of the school have become an impromptu shrine to its lost boy, with the iron work emblazoned with flowers, candles and messages of sympathy.Earlier, Fr McGinnity said Noah#s grieving friends and schoolmates were also in the family#s thoughts.Indeed, right now, students from Noah#s form class are attending a prayer service... together they will be remembering the joy and goodness that he brought into the lives of so many, the priest said. We remember the messages they sent to Noah#s family, and the many tributes they paid on social media and across the airwaves. Those messages and tributes have been a source of immense comfort.One of his close friends said on social media during the week, #Noah had so much potential in everything he did#.What endeared him to his friends was the fact that he carried that potential so lightly and so humbly.

Police believe he might have suffered a head injury after falling off his bicycle and could have been disorientated when he entered the drain.The search for the popular schoolboy brought together hundreds of people from across the city and beyond, uniting the two main communities in a common purpose.Noah and his mother had a personal connection with the church, which was, Fr McGinnity said in his homily, their spiritual home.It was here, in this church that Fiona taught Noah as a child to thank God for his le and to remember that he, like every child, has been sent into the world to share God#s love with everyone, he said, adding that Noah was the kind of boy who was just full of the joy of living.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandClaire McNeillyOpinionTears and white roses, balloons and applause as community le halts for Noah Donohoe funeralNoah Donohoe came back to north Belfast on Wednesday.

Another was found to have driven through a mph zone at mph and in once case, a driver was caught speeding through a mph area at mph.Mr Sherrard said: I actually find it very distressing to think that someone - anyone - would think it is acceptable to drive at mph on any road.There is no way that driver was in control of the car at that speed so the potential to kill some innocent person or themselves is obvious. He continued: Driving through a built up area with a speed limit of mph at almost mph is, in my opinion, the absolute height of irresponsibility.And I really hope that the person detected doing that speed felt the full rigours of the law.We have members in Le After who lost loved ones through road traffic collisions perhaps  or  years ago and they are still suffering, they are still missing their loved one every day just as we continue to miss my father every day.If you take someone#s le because of your driving, you have to live with the consequences of that for ever.I don#t believe anyone who gets into a car and drives over the speed limit intentionally sets out to kill anyone butthey do they are bringing that burden on their own shoulders too. I can#t imagine it is an easy thing to live with.While many speeding offences are at the lower end of the scale, Mr Sherrard said even a few miles per hour over the recommended limit could cause devastation.He added: It beggars belief that in spite of the very graphic road safety ads we see on our television screens depicting how even a few miles an hour over the speed limit can cause catastrophic damage, so many people think there is nothing wrong with speeding.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland#s speeding hotspots as offences surge in yearThe number of speeding offences in Northern Ireland has surged by % year-on-year.Most ReadNoah Donohoe poured #letime of love# into  years, funeral toldCoronavirus Northern Ireland: O#Neill #satisfied# her actions were within regulations at Storey funeral, but says selfie #should not have happened#Man killed in Co Down after being trapped under carClaire McNeillyOpinionTears and white roses, balloons and applause as community le halts for Noah Donohoe funeralPastor Mark McClurg in #emotional#to Ulster Hospital after suffering from Covid- ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

From this date passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  googletag.cmd.push The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said:“As we move throughthe Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety ofpassengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. googletag.cmd.push “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued:“We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is alsoimportant that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe.

From this date passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  googletag.cmd.push The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said:“As we move throughthe Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety ofpassengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. googletag.cmd.push “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued:“We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is alsoimportant that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe.

Noella Hutton hit the big time in America in the s where she appeared on stage with the likes Stevie Nicks and Sheryl Crow. Her first album was critically acclaimed and she toured the States running shoulders with the A-list.

Any plans for gigs and touring were immediately cancelled, so like many artists she turned to virtual gigs which she streamed through Facebook Live. Noella discovered this new style of performing suited her and set herself a target of raising enough money to buy a camper van to go on the road with her beloved dogs Dolly and Buba. I couldnt leave without them, she said. They are my comfort and my security soIm going anywhere I just have to take them. Theyre my wains. Ive had them since they were born. googletag.cmd.push  Dolly and Bubba join Noella for her virtual concerts and have become a firm fan favourite.

She has also been joined by her sister Jeanette Hutton for some of her performances and in one memorable gig she even visited Culmore Manor where she entertained the residents and duetted with her mum. My mammy is just the best, said Noella. “I go up and see her every day and we talk through the window orits a nice day I can take her outside. I cook for every day. I just love me ma. Noellas Facebook gigs were a hit with fans who tuned in from around the world to hear her songs and have a bit of craic. I feel a lot better sitting in my house and having a laugh with people who want to hear me rather than singing in a pub up the town where you are competing with the noise of a poker machine and people shouting over the top of you, she explained. The only people watching are ones that want to watch. I had to learn cover versions to play in the pubs and it just strips the soul clean out of it. The only reason I learnt to play the guitar was so I could write music. With a healthy balance in her virtual tip jar, Noella started looking for the right vehicle to take her and the wains on the road.While scrolling through Facebook at am, Noella stumbled across her dream vehicle which was up for sale in Belfast. All the campers I had seen were big stupid ugly things with no light and big toilets and showers that took up half the room. But this was perfect. It was all I needed so I messaged the guy and said listen, I want the van. It was only up for five minutes, so it was meant to be. Noella has christened her new van Dorothy and after changing the carpets shes ready to start touring Ireland. Paddy in Rathmor Tyres and Paddy from The Carpet Man sorted me out and now Im ready for the road , said Noella. Im going to live stream from wherever I am, whether its to  people or two people Ill talk about where I am so it will be like a documentary every week.” Shell also use her time on the road to write some new songs. I can feel the songs coming, said Noella. “Maybe  or  of them. I might not write anything for five or six years and then it all comes through.

My mammy is just the best, said Noella. “I go up and see her every day and we talk through the window orits a nice day I can take her outside. I cook for every day. I just love me ma. Noellas Facebook gigs were a hit with fans who tuned in from around the world to hear her songs and have a bit of craic. I feel a lot better sitting in my house and having a laugh with people who want to hear me rather than singing in a pub up the town where you are competing with the noise of a poker machine and people shouting over the top of you, she explained. The only people watching are ones that want to watch. I had to learn cover versions to play in the pubs and it just strips the soul clean out of it. The only reason I learnt to play the guitar was so I could write music. With a healthy balance in her virtual tip jar, Noella started looking for the right vehicle to take her and the wains on the road.While scrolling through Facebook at am, Noella stumbled across her dream vehicle which was up for sale in Belfast. All the campers I had seen were big stupid ugly things with no light and big toilets and showers that took up half the room. But this was perfect. It was all I needed so I messaged the guy and said listen, I want the van. It was only up for five minutes, so it was meant to be. Noella has christened her new van Dorothy and after changing the carpets shes ready to start touring Ireland. Paddy in Rathmor Tyres and Paddy from The Carpet Man sorted me out and now Im ready for the road , said Noella. Im going to live stream from wherever I am, whether its to  people or two people Ill talk about where I am so it will be like a documentary every week.” Shell also use her time on the road to write some new songs. I can feel the songs coming, said Noella. “Maybe  or  of them. I might not write anything for five or six years and then it all comes through.

Outside of school, he played an active role in his local GAA club and enjoyed socialising with friends when not working on cars with his father. googletag.cmd.push “Oran showed extreme courage and faith throughout his illness and his loss has left its mark on those who remember him fondly. “Aodhaacuten was such a genuine, lovely person and brought a smile to everyone he was around. He was a dream of a young fella. He was a fantastic hurler and loved representing his club and county. Family, friends and team mates held him in high esteem and he is sorely missed by us all.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner.

Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Cha’s - victory over Manchester City on Thursday confirmed the Merseysiders could no longer be mathematically caught and sparked wild celebrations. For local fanatic Gerard Harraghy, the overwhelming emotion was relief, rather than ecstasy. “The main emotion is a little bit of relief that it’s finally confirmed, to be honest,” he told the County Derry Post. “We knew it was going to happen for a while, but there was that bit of doubt over the last three months that it might not actually get finished is now over. googletag.cmd.push “In a cup final, you have that one moment when you win it, but because it is the league, you don’t really get that. “While we may have clinched it last night, there were actually three or four moments throughout the season that were bigger in inidual terms.” Supporters Barry Craig, Kieran Patterson and David McLaughlin celebrate in a marquee off the new Dungiven bypass. The Magherafelt native, known affectionately to some of his old school friends as ‘Gerry Scouse’, admits the success was dampened a little with supporters not being able to witness it. “I definitely never envisaged being stuck over here and not being able to go to the match,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “A few friends did send me pictures and videos from last night in Liverpool and everyone seemed to be having a good time anyway. “I’ve been supporting Liverpool since I was about six or seven, I would say. I started going regularly before I started uni and for the past ten years it’s been pretty much every home game. “I’ve been on the waiting list for a season ticket for about  years, maybe more. I’m still only about ,th on the list!” While Liverpool’s stretch without a league title lasted three decades, they were not without success in the interim, winning the Champions’ League twice. The emotion of Istanbul in , when Liverpool came from three goals down at half-time to win the Champions’ League on penalties, will always be the pinnacle for Gerard. “I still don’t think anything will ever come close to Istanbul, for me,” he recalled. “It was right in the middle of my A-Levels and I had an exam the next morning, but I did not care one bit! “I would say the league is probably bigger than last year’s Champions’ League, just because it’s the first time we’ve done it in my memory.” As well as ending a -year drought, Liverpool’s th title brings them within one of fierce rivals Manchester United after the latter surged ahead with a period of dominance in the s and s. Gerard watched the game that clinched the  title at home with a few friends. One of them was a Manchester United fan, and the Magherafelt man took great pleasure in his discomfort. “A couple of mates came round and we watched it in the house,” he said. “One of them was actually a Man United fan. He tried to sneak out with about five minutes to go, but we had to lock him in! “I’m pretty sure I’m going to have him deleting his Facebook account by the end of the week with the amount of stuff I’ll be posting. It’s nice to get a bit of revenge after all these years.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Emma De Souza became embroiled in a battle over citizenship after the UK Home Office rejected a residence card application for her US-born husband Jake to live and work in Northern Ireland. In a blog post, the Magherafelt native also expressed disappointment that there would be ‘no northern representation’ in the Seanad. “I am personally disappointed to not be nominated but that personal disappointment pales in comparison to my disappointment that there is no Northern representation,” she said. “The new Programme for Government is titled, “A shared Island”, and the document itself is ambitious with a raft of initiatives to improve North-South relations. googletag.cmd.push “That message was immediately undercut by the absence of a Northern nomination yesterday.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020

resumption of church services after they were suspended  weeks ago due to the Covid- pandemic.Services resumed on Monday after the Northern Ireland Executive announced that public worship could restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable. Sermons will also be kept short.He said that anyone wishing to view their Sunday worship online can log on to downpatrickpresbyterian.org or visit their Facebook page for live streaming.The Dean of Down Cathedral, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said he was looking forward to beginning public worship again and welcoming everyone back this Sunday.However, he urged anyone feeling unwell not to come to church.In a letter to parishioners he said: ldquoTheto worship will be on a phased basis beginning with some of the larger churches first.ldquoWe will also adopt a dferent pattern of service times during the summer period, spreading services throughout the day.He added that face coverings were not a requirement at this stage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Driving force  ","story":"TEENAGE motor racing sensation Daniel Harper has successfully tackled the world famous Nurburgring race circuit in Germany.The  year-old from Annahilt drove the notoriously dficult -mile track for the first time when he made his debut outing in the Nurburgring Endurance Series with the BMW Junior Team.Afterwards he described it as an ldquoinvaluable learning experience, despite an unfortunate technical problem which meant he couldnrsquot contest the race itself.Harper, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in motorsport was announced as a member of the coveted BMW Junior Team programme in January.He was completing an extensive pre-season training schedule when the coronavirus pandemic led to the postponement of the programme in March.At the start of June, he ed to Germany and last week he drove the Nurburgring mdash scene of some of motor racingrsquos greatest feats mdash as he successfully completed his DMSB permit test for the track.For the opening race event, Harper and his team-mates shared a BMW Mi Racing, the German manufacturerrsquos potent, entry-level car.

They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally

support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

Photo courtesy of Google.A ferry, carrying cars and animals as well as produce had operated at the Bannfoot for generations but shut in the s.Recently an online campaign calling for afootbridgeover the Bann River at this point has received almost  signatures of support.However there has been opposition from residents in the Charlestown village close to the Bannfoot.Mr O’Dowd said:“It is not sustainable for cycling and walking around the Lough to be impeded by the failure to bridge the Bann foot, whether it’s a road bridge or foot bridge the opportunity should now be seized to use some of this £m windfall to deliver what is needed.“Bridging the Bann foot is of regional importance and as with any such projects the concerns of locals should be upheld where possible but the project must be delivered. “As with so many regional projects the greater benefit has to be taken on board and to date this has not been the case by decision makers.“I would call on the Minister and the Council to now move forward with this important infrastructural project and open up Lough Neagh and its adjoining communities to the true economic potential of cycling and walking tourism.”The Department for Infrastructure was asked for a response but none was received at the time of going to press.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

confirmed its camping facilitieswill reopen at three sites in the borough.By The NewsroomFriday, th June , : pm\"\"Photo by Aaron McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"

on public transport from july  ","story":"FACE coverings will become mandatory on public transport from Friday July  as part of the recovery process from Covid-, to support efforts to reduce the risk of transmission. From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbcadfbbccb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddbabbdfdcda   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
