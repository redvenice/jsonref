Regardless, the storm is expected to deal serious damage to both coastal and inland communities thanks to its strong winds and heavy rains.Even if it doesn’t intensify as much as forecast, the storm is still expected to be very dangerous, bringing hurricane-force winds greater than 74 miles per hour to the northeastern Gulf Coast by Wednesday, October 10 in the area currently under a hurricane warning.  This area currently s  from just north of Tampa Bay Area to the Alabama coastline, though tropical storm-force winds above 39 miles per hour are also expected to be felt in this area from the night of Tuesday, October 9 until the morning of Wednesday, October 10.Areas just outside the hurricane warning region currently under a tropical storm warning will likely see tropical storm-force winds on the night of Tuesday, October 9 and morning of Wednesday, October 10.    The powerful hurricane will bring torrential rains, strong winds and catastrophic storm surgeThe hurricane’s path is projected to bring widespread power outages to the Florida Panhandle region and even to southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, potentially leaving up to two million people without power from Florida to southeastern Virginia.In addition, life-threatening storm surges as high as eight to 12 feet are possible from the western end of the Florida Panhandle all the way to the Tampa Bay Area.For rainfall, the storm is expected to dump four to eight inches in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend region of Florida into southern Georgia and southeastern Alabama. Local rainfall of up to a foot is possible while life-threatening flash flooding cannot be ruled out either.Eastern Georgia, the Carolinas and southern Virginia could potentially see three to six inches of rain while parts of the Florida Peninsula, Mid-Atlantic and New England regions could possibly see one to three inches of rain.The storm could also bring some isolated tornadoes to the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia.How wide is Hurricane Michael?The storm is threatening more than 300 miles of the Golf Coast and is expected to make landfall along a 150-mile stretch of the Florida coast.Hurricane Michael evacuation zonesAs the dangerous storm bears down on the Florida Panhandle and broader northeastern Gulf Coast region, mandatory evacuations have already been issued.Three Florida counties have ordered mandatory evacuations, including Gulf County, where the storm could potentially make a direct landfall hit.Wakulla County has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all residents in its Zone A evacuation zone as well as for residents living in weak structures and mobile homes. Bay County has also issued a mandatory evacuation for Zones A, B and C.When will Hurricane Michael make landfall?Though the exact landfall area of the monstrous storm isn’t yet known, officials have expressed increased confidence that it will ultimately be in the Florida Panhandle.Florida Governor Rick Scott didn’t mince words when warning residents about the storm, saying: ‘Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades.’    The Florida Panhandle is in the crosshairs of Hurricane Michael as it barrels towards the coastAccording to FEMA official Jeff Byard, hurricane-force winds are expected to extend ‘well inland’ from where the storm makes landfall, noting that Florida’s power infrastructure could be hit even worse than North and South Carolina’s during Hurricane Florence.In preparation for the storm, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties and said that 2,000 National Guard members were mobilized to assist with the preparation and recovery efforts.Scott again issued a dire warning to his state’s residents as the hurricane took aim at the Florida Panhandle, saying: ‘Water will come miles inshore and could easily be over the roofs of houses.‘You cannot hide from storm surge so get prepared and get out if an evacuation is ordered.‘Remember, we can rebuild your house, but we cannot rebuild your life.’ Everything you need to know about Chief Justice John Roberts who wants to investigate Brett KavanaughWhy is Kanye West meeting Donald Trump at the White House?BTS will perform on Graham Norton\u0026#8217s show this week amid Love Yourself London TourLike mother, like daughter: Did Princess Eugenie dye her hair red like mother Sarah Ferguson for her big day?National Coming Out Day 2018: All you need to knowWho is Josh Radnor?

Fredrick Farnsworth (left, outside Liverpool Magistrates\u0027 Court) has been jailed for 18 months after he admitted to being in charge of the dangerously out of control animals (shown right)Farnsworth claimed he did not even know the names of the dogs - one black and one beige - owned by a man called Mark who is in jail.Edmund Haygarth, prosecuting, said: \u0027The Crown would say foolishly and irresponsibly he took them out into the park without collars and without leads.\u0027The two boys were playing football in a caged area, in a park off Stapleton Avenue, at around 5pm, when the beige dog ran over and jumped up.Witnesses Shane Oosthuizen and Megan Herbert, who were walking their three dogs, saw the children try to climb onto a raised area to escape. Farnsworth slowly ran over to intervene but it was heroic Mr Oosthuizen who dragged the dogs off Lewis, before other people came to help. Farnsworth said he took the dogs home and locked them in his garage before going back to the park, but when he returned with police, they had gone.He confessed that the dogs had earlier ripped apart a football belonging to some other boys and he had paid them £10, before the second attack.The OAP told officers he heard Lewis screaming \u0027I think I\u0027m going to die\u0027, but refused to name the two people he initially said owned the animals.Mr Haygarth said: \u0027The families\u0027 anger and I think the anger of much of the community at large is the fact the dogs are still out there.\u0027The court heard the incident left Lewis scarred for life and both he and his friend psychologically damaged and requiring counselling.          The youngster was forced to make repeat visits to hospital for treatment, and even developed deadly sepsis from his wounds (pictured)Farnsworth had 12 previous convictions for 19 offences, the last in 1999, mostly for dishonesty and driving matters, but also assaults in the 1960s. Mr Rawson said: \u0027It was an offence brought about by his lack of foresight. He regrets it, he\u0027s upset about it and he\u0027s sorry.\u0027He said Farnsworth had parental responsibility for his 16 year-old grandson, but if he was jailed, his wife would look after the boy.Judge Woodhall said a man of Farnsworth\u0027s age and ill health was never going to be able to control the dogs and by the time he intervened it was \u0027too little, too late\u0027.  He said: \u0027You claimed to not know where they had gone.

What message would it send to you and the public if the person responsible did nothing to ensure the dogs could be found?\u0027Judge Woodhall noted that in a pre-sentence report Farnsworth said he would rather spend time in prison than place his grandson at risk by naming the dogs\u0027 owner.He said: \u0027It seems you\u0027re in effect condoning what happened - putting other members of the public at risk of serious injury.\u0027The judge ordered the destruction of the dogs and banned Farnsworth from keeping dogs indefinitely.Unrepentant Farnsworth showed no emotion as he was jailed for 18 months.OAP refuses to help police find dogs that mauled 11-year-old in horrific attack - Liverpool Echo"},{"url":null,"title":"Weather Channel meteorologist dodges flying 2x4 live broadcast Hurricane Michael","story":"Jim Cantore was reporting from Panama City Beach, Florida, (left) when a plank of wood came flying at him (right)          He then ran behind a pillar to stay protected from anymore debris blown by the stormSanders thanked the meteorologist in two tweets after his live report, praising Cantore and stating that he avoided a concussion after being blown into a concrete pillar.In the footage, Cantore is seen delivering a piece-to-camera when suddenly the piece of wood comes flying at him. Incredible video from eye of Hurricane Michael emerges as...\u0027This was set up a long time ago\u0027: Defiant Trump defends...Share this articleThinking he\u0027s about to be hit, the meteorologist breaks off mid-sentence and jumps out of the way while clutching his head.In a separate clip, Kerry Sanders is seen swaying back and forth as the ferocious winds nearly blow him over. The meteorologist also attracted attention for rescuing NBC\u0027s Kerry Sanders who was nearly blown off his feet          Cantore pushed Sanders to safety.

If the forensic team are allowed in they know exactly where to go’.Khashoggi had arrived at the consulate in Istanbul shortly after 1pm on Oct 2nd to collect papers showing he was orced in Saudi Arabia and free to marry his fiance the next day.Half an hour before he turned up the local Turkish staff working at the embassy were told to take the rest of the day off because a high-level diplomatic meeting was planned for the afternoon.The source told MEE that Khashoggi was greeted by an official and led straight to Mr al-Otaiba’s room .Shortly afterwards two men arrived, dragging the 59-year-old off into another room where they killed him., it was claimedIt’s not known how the journalist was killed, but the body was then taken to a third room where it was dismembered.It’s understood the Turkish prosecutor general is now deliberating whether to dig up Mr al-Otaiba’s garden, to see whether Khashoggi’s remains were buried there.This is because one of the 22 vehicles registered to the consulate left the building at 3.15pm and went 200 metres to the address.The Turkish authorities are believed to have audio and video evidence of the killing but it’s not known how they got it.But, it seems unlikely Saudi Arabia would allow Turkish officials to dig up the garden at the consul.

Altaibi (right) were also named by Turkish newspaper SabahTurkish officials believe Khashoggi may have been murdered and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and then taken out of the country by private jet.However, a Saudi source told Reuters that British intelligence believed there had been an attempt to drug Khashoggi inside the consulate that culminated in an overdose. He said the information came from a British intelligence source. Investigators are confident they may yet discover Khashoggi\u0027s fate despite their ban from the consulate, using data collected from his Apple Watch - which was connected to a phone he left outside with his fiancee.\u0027We have determined that it was on him when he walked into the consulate,\u0027 the security official said. Investigators are trying to determine what information the watch transmitted.\u0027Intelligence services, the prosecutor\u0027s office and a technology team are working on this. Turkey does not have the watch so we are trying to do it through connected devices,\u0027 he said.Tech experts say an Apple Watch can provide data such as location and heart rate. But what investigators can find out depends on the model of watch, whether it was connected to the internet, and whether it is near enough an iPhone to synchronize.  Waleed Abdullah M.

Ten stayed at the five-star Mövenpick hotel, which boasts 249 luxury rooms and a ballroom. It is located just 650 yards from the Saudi embassy where Mr Khashoggi vanished.The remaining five checked in to the Wyndham Grand hotel, another five-star establishment 15 minutes\u0027 walk to the south, in the direction of the airport. The men, believed to hold Saudi passports, reportedly flew into Turkey on a number of different flights.

Officials said it was part of a convoy of six cars, several with diplomatic number plates, which left the consulate grounds two hours after Khashoggi went inside.Turkish police were allowed into the building on Tuesday, a week after Khashoggi vanished, and said that CCTV footage from inside has gone missing and Turkish staff were abruptly told to take a holiday on the day in question.Yesterday, a source close to the Saudi royal family told DailyMail.com that the Washington Post writer, and long-standing critic of Saudi Arabia, is alive and being held captive in his home country after being flown to Riyadh in a private jet.According to the source, after entering the embassy Khashoggi was taken in a black Mercedes S-500 and a white minivan with four Saudi officials to Istanbul airport, where he was flown on a private jet to Riyadh and is now being held.Flight records show that a Gulf Stream IV private jet, tail number HZ-SK2, landed in Istanbul at 3am on October 2, the day Khashoggi disappeared.

Khashoggi was driven from there to Riyadh, and was held there, the source said.The source was told Khashoggi is still alive, contradicting the claims he was murdered in the Istanbul embassy.Turkish police also revealed they are seeking information about a black Mercedes van on Monday in connection with Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance.  WhatsApp records show Khashoggi last viewed his messages on his US cell phone at 1.06pm on Tuesday, around the time he entered the embassy. On Monday President Trump said that he was \u0027concerned\u0027 about reports on Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance.\u0027I am concerned about that,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027I don\u0027t like hearing about it and hopefully that will sort itself out. Right now, nobody knows anything about it.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s some pretty bad stories about it. I do not like it,\u0027 he added.Saudi Arabia\u0027s ambassador to the US, Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, said claims Khashoggi had been killed or detained by Saudi authorities were \u0027absolutely false, and baseless,\u0027 according to a statement provided to CNN.

Turkish TV channel TRT also revealed images of the private jet which allegedly ferried the men in and out of Turkey          Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) warned Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoonThe source claimed US officials found out Saudi agents planned to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia - although it was not clear whether they wanted to arrest and interrogate Khashoggi or to kill him from the information gathered.It is also not known whether the United States warned Khashoggi that he was a target, the source said.Saudi officials denied reports they sent a 15-man team to Istanbul on the day Khashoggi disappeared, saying that the only team they sent to Turkey consisted of investigators who arrived Saturday to help find the journalist.Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a stark warning to Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoon.\u0027Just met the Saudi ambassador to seek urgent answers over Jamal Khashoggi,\u0027 he said in a tweet,\u0027 Violence against journalists worldwide is going up \u0026amp is a grave threat to freedom of expression.\u0027\u0027If media reports prove correct, we will treat the incident seriously - friendships depend on shared values.\u0027He discussed the episode with the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office, Sir Simon McDonald, on Monday.Hunt also spoke with the Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir, for the first time raising the issue at ministerial level.          The former government adviser, pictured outside the BBC in London, has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since last year to avoid possible arrest.He interviewed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan before al-Qaida was formed, then met him in Sudan in 1995. Following bin Laden\u0027s rise likely helped cement Khashoggi\u0027s ties with powerful former Saudi spy chief, Turki Al-Faisal.Khashoggi rubbed shoulders with the Saudi royal family and supported efforts to nudge the kingdom\u0027s entrenched ultra-conservative clerics to accept reforms. He served as an editor for nine years on the Islamist-leaning al-Madina newspaper and was frequently quoted in the Western media as an expert on Islamic radicals and a reformist voice.However, he was fired from his post as an editor at Al-Watan, a liberal paper founded after the 911 terror attacks, just two months after he took the job in 2003. The country\u0027s ultra-conservative clerics had pushed back against his criticism of the powerful religious police and Ibn Taymiyah, a medieval cleric viewed as the spiritual forefather of Wahhabism, the conservative interpretation of Islam that is the founding tenant of the kingdom.Khoshaggi then served as media adviser to Al-Faisal, the former spy chief, who was at the time the ambassador to the United States.Khashoggi returned to Al-Watan in 2007, where he continued his criticism of the clerics as the late King Abdullah implemented cautious reforms to try to shake their hold. Three years later, he was forced to resign again after a series of articles criticizing Salafism, the ultra-conservative Sunni Islam movement from which Wahhabism stems.In 2010, Saudi billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal tapped him to lead his new TV station, touted as a rival to Qatari-funded Al-Jazeera, a staunch critic of the kingdom. But the new Al-Arab station, based in Bahrain, was shut down hours after it launched, for hosting a Bahraini opposition figure.Khoshaggi\u0027s final break with the Saudi authorities followed the Arab Spring protests that swept through the region in 2011, shaking the power base of traditional leaders and giving rise to Islamists, only to be followed by unprecedented crackdowns on those calling for change. Siding with the opposition in Egypt and Syria, Khashoggi became a vocal critic of his own government\u0027s stance there and a defender of moderate Islamists, which Riyadh considered an existential threat.\u0027This was a critical period in Arab history. I had to take a position. The Arab world had waited for this moment of freedom for a thousand years,\u0027 Khashoggi told a Turkey-based Syrian opposition television station last month, just days before he disappeared.He also criticized his government\u0027s diplomatic break with Qatar and war on Yemen as well as Riyadh\u0027s policy toward its archenemy, Iran, whose influence has grown in neighboring Yemen and in Syria.In the Sept. 23 interview, he called Saudi Arabia\u0027s foreign policy \u0027narrow minded,\u0027 and ridiculed its crackdown on political Islam, urging the kingdom to realign its policy to partner with Turkey, a close Qatar ally.\u0027Saudi is the mother and father of political Islam. It is based on political Islam,\u0027 Khoshaggi said. \u0027The only recipe to get Iranians out of Syria - it is not Trump or anyone else- it is through the support of the Syrian revolution. ... Saudi Arabia must return to supporting the Syrian revolution and partnering with Turkey on this.\u0027Eight days later, on October 2, he disappeared while on a visit to the consulate in Istanbul for paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee. The consulate insists the writer left its premises alive, contradicting Turkish officials.Before his disappearance, Khoshaggi had been living since last year in the U.S. in self-imposed exile, after he fled the kingdom amid a crackdown on intellectuals and activists who criticized policies of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\u0027As of now, I would say Mohammed bin Salman is acting like Putin. He is imposing very selective justice,\u0027 Khashoggi wrote in the Post last year after he fled the kingdom, saying he feared returning home.He described \u0027dramatic\u0027 scenes of arrest of government critics accused of receiving Qatari funding. They included a friend of Khashoggi\u0027s who had just returned from a trip to the U.S. as part of an official Saudi delegation.\u0027That is how breathtakingly fast you can fall out of favor with Saudi Arabia,\u0027 he wrote.                                   Police CCTV video made available through Turkish Newspaper Sabah allegedly shows suspects wandering near the consulate on Tuesday          One of the black Mercedes vans at the center of the operation was shown on CCTV leaving the consulate on Tuesday afternoon          Tawakkol Karman, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate for 2011 holds a picture of missing Saudi writer Jamal KhashoggiEconomist and citizen-journalist Essam al-Zamel was put on trial this month for criticising the government\u0027s economic strategy in a series of tweets and reports.

The Belfast bakers refused to make a cake decorated with the words \u0027Support Gay Marriage\u0027\u0027It is deeply humiliating, and an affront to human dignity, to deny someone a service because of that person\u0027s race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief. But that is not what happened in this case.\u0027She went on: \u0027As to Mr Lee\u0027s claim based on sexual discrimination, the bakers did not refuse to fulfil his order because of his sexual orientation. They would have refused to make such a cake for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation.\u0027LGBTQ children and teens are at a three-fold higher risk of...Gay and transgender students and teachers could be turned...Share this articleThe court also said Mr Lee had no claim against Ashers on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion.Lady Hale added: \u0027The bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage.    Ashers general manager Daniel McArthur said outside court: \u0027I want to start by thanking God. He has been with us during the challenges of the last four years. Through the Bible and the support of Christians, He has comforted us and sustained us. He is our rock and all His ways are just.\u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful. Grateful to the judges and especially grateful to God.\u0027We\u0027re particularly pleased the Supreme Court emphatically accepted what we\u0027ve said all along – we did not turn down this order because of the person who made it, but because of the message itself.\u0027The judges have given a clear signal today. In fact it couldn\u0027t be any clearer. Family businesses like ours are free to focus on giving all their customers the best service they can – without being forced to promote other people\u0027s campaigns.\u0027I know a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today, because this ruling protects freedom of speech and freedom of conscience for everyone.\u0027On behalf of my family can I say thank you to everyone who has supported us or prayed for us through all this.\u0027I do want to take this opportunity to thank our whole legal team for working so hard for us over the last four years. And also to thank the entire Christian Institute staff for their help and support from the very beginning.\u0027We want to move on from this now, and I\u0027m sure Mr Lee does too. And let me just finish by saying that he will always be welcome at any of our shops. Thank you\u0027.Mr Lee was also present for the latest ruling in a case which has attracted enormous attention.The bakery\u0027s appeal against the finding of discrimination was heard at the Supreme Court sitting in Belfast in May.During the hearing the justices were told that the owners were being forced to act against their religious beliefs.David Scoffield QC, for Ashers, argued that the state was penalising the baking firm, with the courts effectively compelling or forcing them to make a cake bearing a message with which they disagree as a matter of religious conscience.Speaking outside court, Mr McArthur said: \u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. \u0027After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful.

Daniel McArthur said outside court that \u0027a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today\u0027Mounting an unsuccessful challenge at the Court of Appeal in Belfast in 2016, Ashers contended that it never had an issue with Mr Lee\u0027s sexuality, rather the message he was seeking to put on the cake.Now share your opinionMr Scoffield told the justices that the case, a simple transaction, raised an issue of principle since those with deeply-held religious or philosophical convictions could be compelled to act against their beliefs.Robin Allen QC, for Mr Lee, said: \u0027This was a relatively small incident in his life which has become enormously significant and continues to be so. That is a heavy burden to bear for one inidual.\u0027Speaking outside court, Mr Lee said: \u0027To me, this was never about a campaign or a statement. All I wanted was to order a cake in a shop that sold cakes to order.\u0027I paid my money, my money was taken and then a few days later it was refused. That made me feel like a second-class citizen.\u0027I\u0027m concerned not just for the implications for myself and other gay people, but for every single one of us.\u0027Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK or Ireland where same-sex marriage is outlawed, with Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s DUP allies staunch opponents of changing the law.Following the ruling,  DUP leader Arlene Foster said the judgment was \u0027historic and seminal\u0027, adding: \u0027This has been a long journey for everyone involved in the case. \u0027I commend Amy \u0026amp Daniel McArthur for their grace and perseverance. This now provides clarity for people of all faiths and none.\u0027          The UK Supreme Court has today released its judgment regarding the widely-reported \u0027gay cake\u0027 case.In 2014, a gay man and activist, Gareth Lee, made an order to Ashers Bakery in Belfast for a cake to have a message \u0027Support Gay Marriage\u0027 in icing, together with an image of Sesame Street\u0027s Bert and Ernie. The bakery refused to fulfil Mr Lee\u0027s order, explaining that they were a Christian business and could not print the message, and a full refund was given.Mr Lee brought proceedings against Ashers for direct discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and the Belfast County Court awarded £500 as damages. This decision was upheld by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.Ashers appealed, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the bakery did not commit direct discrimination against Mr Lee. In an important clarification of the concept of \u0027direct discrimination\u0027, it must be shown that an inidual has been treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic, which in this case was Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. In this case, no evidence was shown that Mr Lee was treated less favourably because he was gay, and Ashers objected only to the message being requested. Had Mr Lee not been gay but requested the same message, Ashers would have again refused, so there was no less favourable treatment linked to Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. Rather than the inidual messenger, it was the message Ashers was found to have discriminated against, which was not unlawful. Lady Hale stated that \u0027the bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage, but that is quite different from obliging them to supply a cake iced with a message with which they profoundly disagreed.\u0027This judgment clarifies the narrow scope of direct discrimination.There must be evidence that an inidual\u0027s own protected characteristic was the reason for the less favourable treatment. Interestingly, had Mr Lee been a disabled person, and been refused a cake with a message supporting disability rights, it is arguably this would amount to \u0027discrimination arising from disability\u0027 and would be unlawful under the Equality Act, as it would be unfavourable treatment because of something arising in consequence of the inidual\u0027s disability. However, this broader concept of protection is only available to disabled persons. Other protected characteristics, like sexual orientation, gender, race and age can only rely on the narrower concept of direct discrimination, the limits of which have been starkly highlighted by the Supreme Court.Christian bakery wins appeal in Supreme Court \u0027gay cake\u0027 case"},{"url":null,"title":"Passengers help screaming man kicked plane resists deported Somalia","story":"    Result: The man was eventually removed from the Turkish Airlines flight at Heathrow Airport, after passengers demanded that he be taken off the plane In the footage a number of riled up passengers shout to \u0027take him off the plane\u0027 and a number others turn from their seats to start filming the confrontation.One passenger points out the man being deported says he is going to Mogadishu in Somalia and the officer responds: \u0027And you believe him?\u0027In another incident a passenger claims that people die in Mogadishu, the official responds: \u0027They die in London, sir.\u0027The Home Office worker then tells passengers he has been to Mogadishu several times and it was \u0027all right\u0027.

Bradley, a journalist who specialises in Middle East issues, wrote in the Spectator.In the 1970s, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood, which aims to free the Islamic world from western influence.In his columns, Bradley says, he urged Crown Prince Mohammed to embrace the rise of political Islam, rather than western-style democracy,In 2003, following his sacking as editor of Saudi daily newspaper Al Watan, Khashoggi became known as a liberal progressive.He was dismissed because he had allowed a columnist to criticise an Islamic scholar who is considered the founding father of Wahhabism – a movement that the Muslim Brotherhood has always been at odds with.And although Crown Prince Mohammed, on the other hand, rejects Wahhabism – whose followers detest democracy as a western invention – he considered the Muslim Brotherhood the main threat to his vision for the kingdom.Most clerics imprisoned in Saudi Arabia over the past two years have ties to the Brotherhood.Since then, Khashoggi has become a de facto leader of the Saudi branch – and therefore, the biggest political threat to the Crown Prince.Furthermore, Khashoggi also had information on the Saudi royal family\u0027s ties to al-Qaeda before the September 11 terror attacks.Khashoggi befriended Osama bin Laden in the 1980s and 1990s.He was employed by Saudi intelligence services to persuade bin Laden to make peace with the Saudi royal family.Bradley, a former colleague of Khashoggi\u0027s, believes the Saudis may have also worried that he had become a US asset.Also, earlier this year, he had established a new political party in the US called Democracy for the Arab World.Khashoggi\u0027s recent rejection of the offer to return to Saudi Arabia as an advisor may have been the final straw.

All we needed was a piece of paper.\u0027Miss Cengiz said Mr Khashoggi had visited the consulate on September 28 despite some concern that he could be in danger.She wrote: \u0027Although his opinions had angered certain people, he said, the tensions between himself and Saudi Arabia did not amount to hate, grudges or threats.\u0027He was, however, increasingly worried about an unprecedented wave of arrests in his country.\u0027She said he did not think the Saudis could force him to stay at the consulate, adding: \u0027He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil. After a positive first meeting with consular staff, who welcomed him warmly and assured him that the necessary paperwork would come through, Jamal was hardly concerned ahead of his second visit.\u0027He walked into the consulate of Saudi Arabia, his native country, without doubting he would be safe there. But after three hours I was overcome with fear and concern.\u0027She went in to ask where he was but was told he had left without her noticing. \u0027Although my hope slowly fades away each passing day, I remain confident that Jamal is still alive,\u0027 she added.

They had a choice between what is working for children and what left wing dogma says.\u0027They have made their choice. For them, ideology comes before children\u0027s education.\u0027He added, saying: \u0027Angela Rayner may call it local democratic control.\u0027I call it not trusting schools.

The showroom – on a stretch of Tottenham Court Road, central London, known for furniture stores – is just 400 sq metres and took months, rather than years, to open.The sales slowdown has spurred the new group chief executive, Jesper Brodin, who took over last year, into action as the company starts a new chapter after the death of its influential founder, Ingvar Kamprad. Brodin has signed off on a raft of store experiments as well as the purchase of gig economy odd-jobs company TaskRabbit.“The big units are the most important assets we have. The biggest part of the growth is online but the stores themselves are also growing.” Ikea’s UK turnover is close to £2bn.The transfer of sales to online is undermining the economics of running large high street chains, with many stores hit by hefty increases in business rates after last year’s revaluation. At the same time, shoppers are reining in spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes.“The housing market is really lacklustre and on top of that people are telling us they are worried about making big ticket purchases, as well as Brexit and their levels of credit and debt,” said Retail Economics’ chief executive, Richard Lim. “The structural shift is towards online and some chains simply have too many stores.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c675979078695e352d175927f2cd3fb0f384fc69/320_600_5801_3481/master/5801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0ed1ed23da5780f4df1ab2065bd815e","title":"patisserie valerie to cease trading without immediate injection of capital","story":"Board of cakes and cafe chain says it is ‘assessing all options available to the business’The stricken cakes and cafe chain Patisserie Valerie said it will have to cease trading without “an immediate injection of capital”.The owner of Patisserie Valerie was plunged into financial crisis on Wednesday after it revealed a multimillion-pound accounting black hole and that its main trading subsidiary was facing a winding-up order.On Thursday, the board said there was a “material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business” and it would need new funds to continue trading.It said the company was “assessing all options available to the business to keep it trading and will update the market in due course”.The company’s options for a cash injection include an emergency loan, a rights issue or a white knight bidder who may insist on a pre-pack administration process.Duncan Swift, the head of food advisory at the accountancy firm Moore Stephens, said he was aware that some suppliers to Patisserie Valerie’s trading subsidiary, Stonebeach, had paused deliveries until the position of the company was clarified.Swift said Stonebeach should not be able to make new orders or take credit from suppliers, adding that only products already in transit and unable to be recalled were likely to be delivered in the coming days.“A winding-up order would normally be the death knell for a business. The saving grace may be that it is part of a larger group which has got financial support and shareholders with reserves they could use to refinance the company,” he said.The 92-year-old cake chain, which has more than 200 stores and more than 2,500 employees, on Wednesday halted trading in its shares as it revealed “potentially fraudulent” financial irregularities that, according to Sky News, could amount to more than £20m.Just hours after the suspension, Patisserie Holdings said its board had been unaware that HM Revenue and Customs had filed a winding-up petition at the high court against Stonebeach over an unpaid £1.14m tax bill. The petition was filed on 14 September and published in the London Gazette, the official public record, on 5 October.The winding-up petition enables other creditors to call in their debts and is likely to have prompted banks to freeze Stonebeach’s accounts and credit insurers to withdraw cover for its suppliers. Patisserie Holdings declined to comment.All transactions from 5 October are subject to scrutiny and in such cases the directors could potentially be held personally accountable for trading while insolvent.Patisserie Holdings is understood to have called in PricewaterhouseCoopers to carry out a forensic analysis of its books. It is also expected that the Financial Reporting Council and the Financial Conduct Authority regulators will examine the issues at Patisserie Valerie. The Serious Fraud Office could also potentially look into the matter. All three bodies declined to comment on whether they had yet been in touch with the company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c2bb8510465651cfedc4a7f0867cb1bdc434bd/0_264_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40944506dce8b3448e22a96ea71c98d4","title":"wh smith to close six stores and 24 cardmarket outlets","story":"WH Smith is closing about 30 stores, most of which are part of its Cardmarket budget chain, as it adapts to challenging conditions on the high street.Stephen Clarke, the chief executive, said the retailer would be closing six WH Smith stores which had “not got a hope of making any money” and about 24 Cardmarket outlets over the next three years. WH Smith would not confirm how many jobs would be affected, but Clarke said staff would probably be redeployed to other stores as the chain continued to open new outlets in hospitals, airports and other travel hubs.The chain said it expected to open up to 20 stores in the UK this year, about half of which would be in hospitals, and had 607 high street shops as well as 867 travel outlets around the world.The group was preparing to bring 40 crown post offices into its stores next year and take on the franchises of 33 further post offices which the state-owned service currently runs in WH Smith stores. As a result it would run more than 200 post offices, which it sees as a way to use spare space and encourage shoppers to visit its stores regularly.Clarke said the arrangement was attractive to the Post Office because WH Smith stores cost less to rent and run.Rhys McCarthy, a national officer of the Unite trade union, said the post office move was “accelerating privatisation by stealth”.Clarke said high street conditions were tough but WH Smith was “doing well”, making its third-highest profit in 15 years after a pick-up in trading in the last six months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5aa945a92f5b33482aae86c7f43c211dbc764c/0_86_3204_1922/master/3204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67f726fa5afb7fc5b047d811d0a1d1c7","title":"tell us how would a no deal brexit impact your business","story":"What issues do you anticipate for your business or sector should the UK leave the EU without a deal?Government ministers released a batch of papers in September warning of the risks of leaving the European Union without a deal.Impact papers stressed some of the day-to-day effects after Theresa May chaired a special meeting of the cabinet focused on how a no-deal outcome could be handled.We would like to hear from you if you work in a sector you think may be affected by a no-deal Brexit and to find out what the potential impact would mean for you.Tell us a little about what you do and how your reading of the situation means your business or sector could be affected in our encrypted form below.

No one believes a word of it. If I walked into my bank and tried to deposit £55m, I would be asked to see the manager, if not the police. But if I were to shift such sums through a Belgravia flat or a West End jeweller or an offshore tax haven, I would be offered a tier 1 golden visa and honoured status as an inward investor. It is McMafia stream this way, sir, no questions asked. Eat your heart out, Polish plumber.I have some sympathy for Zamira Hajiyeva, who this week had her right to financial privacy stripped by the high court. Her husband, imprisoned in their native Azerbaijan for fraud, is what her lawyer called a “fat cat international banker”, which he clearly thought would woo the court. She has two properties worth £22m, plus £4,000 a day to spend at Harrods, a Gulfstream jet and an Ascot golf course. These are naturally “based” in Guernsey and the British Virgin Islands. Hajiyeva might reasonably protest that she is just like any other upright Knightsbridge citizen down the ages.The first ever of the government’s unexplained wealth orders merely requires Hajiyeva to “explain” the source of her riches. The suspicion is clearly that it was her husband’s bank. Her lawyers rightly point out that the granting of the order “does not and should not be taken to imply any wrongdoing”.When tax-haven transparency was supposedly introduced two years ago, it was assumed that openness would be a deterrent to money laundering. But it took the Panama Papers scandal of 2016 to reveal the full extent of Caribbean tax poaching rackets.The contrast was in what happened next. Tax dodgers in New York were paraded from their offices in handcuffs. The Germans brought 71 prosecutions. The Spaniards successfully prosecuted Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for tax fraud. Pakistan jailed its prime minister, no less, for 10 years.In Britain, the revelations led to just four arrests and six interviews under caution. In an extraordinary explanation, the deputy director of HMRC, Richard Las, last month said that “wealthy and prominent members of the community” were often not prosecuted, as HMRC preferred to use their fear of “the reputational damage of custodial sentences” in private negotiations. Welcome to banana republic justice.Governments have long implied that offering houseroom to laundered money harms no one, benefits Britain and ranks as “inward investment”. Tony Blair and David Cameron openly welcomed Russian oligarchs, Saudi princes and Chinese property hoarders. Experts put the amount of dirty money floating around the world offshore at some £21tn, with as much as £390bn removed from Russia since the fall of the Berlin wall alone. The idea of such loot clearly dazzled British ministers, even though the Treasury sees virtually none of it.If other countries allow their wealth to be stolen it may not be Britain’s problem, but it makes Britain an accessory to the greatest kleptomania of the century. To the US tax authorities, as to the man in the Moscow street, London is the capital of oligarchia, of McMafia operations. It is responsible for two-thirds of the world’s tax havens, mostly in the Caribbean, their legality no defence against their deplorable morality. They are like medieval pirates, a standing rebuke to the world’s economic order.A related issue is fairness. Last week, the property magnate Nick Candy refinanced his London flat at a stupefying £160m, a valuation that proves that cash is continuing to flood out of Russia, China and the Gulf. At the last count, there was some £35bn of Russian money alone sloshing through London’s jurisdiction. With housing supposedly in dire supply, planners have allowed whole streets in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea to become ghost towns, rows of empty townhouses and blocks of flats. The impact on London’s property market of this “buy-to-leave” is becoming stark. Having lived in London all my life, I find its status as the world’s financial funk-hole sickening. Yet it leaves London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, as relaxed as it left his predecessor, Boris Johnson.Other countries require foreigners, at the very least, to pay local income and realistic property taxes. London’s oligarchs pay little more than £2,000 a year to their councils. Residents of Manhattan pay two, three or even 10 times that, and even the richest condominiums tend to require owners to be resident. Other world cities ban foreigners from owning, leasing or at least failing to occupy property – among them Berlin, Singapore and Hong Kong. Australia bans incomers from buying in Sydney and Melbourne. This does not appear to harm their economies. As for such blatant tax dodging as “non-domiciled” status, it is indefensible. Britain legalises what puts American citizens in jail.Will unexplained wealth orders make a difference? Seeking to keep out fraudsters and thieves is a reasonable thing for a country to do. But it means little if the authorities do nothing beyond declare an occasional inidual persona non grata.As long as “fat cat bankers” can win tier 1 visas, and as long as crown territories are treated with kid gloves, the world’s cash will beat on London’s door. As long as governments refuse to restrict property ownership or levy realistic local taxes, the money will come. Now we have Brexit, and with it the likelihood of an exodus of respectable investment. Any money, clean or dirty, may seem like good news. Does London really want to become another Monaco or Macau, a refuge for fiscal piracy on the fringe of Europe? I will not hold my breath."},{"url":null,"title":"the ss19 takeaway 10 of the most stylish trends from the shows a photo essay","story":"After one month, four cities and hundreds of shows, the common threads have started to weave their own stories for next summer. Here, we show you where the designers’ heads are atby  Jo Jones and  Scarlett Conlon design by  Jonny WeeksThis show season was headline-laden before it had even begun.

But with the reviews published and all being said, shown and done, what are the trends that will trickle down into our wardrobes next summer? Read on to get an insight into what springsummer 2019 is going to look like.Responsible for the heyday of Alexis Colby, Bananarama and Prince, the 80s is the decade that keeps on giving. Designers mined the most popular fashion references: at Moschino, Jeremy Scott presented it in pin-sharp suits that were double breasted and worn with wide-brimmed hats at Balenciaga, Gucci and Escada, it was all about the power shoulder, too, seen in bold primary-hued blazers and knee-length dresses.Hedi Slimane at Celine and Isabel Marant were thinking after dark with their take on the trend, seen in the former’s ruffled and puff-skirt mini-dresses and the latter’s stonewashed-denim looks. Not one for wallflowers, the 2019 take on the trend is all about more, more, more.Designers took their cue from the beach for one of the most prevailing trends of the season and it came in many guises. Oscar de la Renta and Rejina Pyo both found beauty in accessories that looked as if they had been beach-combed think shell necklaces and stone embellishment found on the plackets of skirt suits.Elsewhere, the seaside inspiration was more focused on maritime references. Rope was a recurring theme at Chloé, Monse, Courrèges, The Row, Ports 1961 and Victoria Beckham, found in accessories, details and motifs. Fishermen’s hats, meanwhile, riffed off life on the ocean wave and were seen at 3.1 Phillip Lim, Michael Kors and Boss.Fringing was a firm favourite at Anna Sui, Michael Kors, Sonia Rykiel and Chloé. From suede to jacquard, leather to silk, affects ranged from perfectly polished to deliberately undone.At Loewe, Jonathan Anderson’s mishmash of textures and stimuli of kinetic space meant that they popped up and bobbed along on bags, while at Longchamp they extended from skirts to satchels, carried low so as to sweep the ground. The trim was especially elevated at Givenchy – where it was dramatic in rhinestone – and at Area, which added fringe embellishment to boots and bodystockings. There was a distinct sense of the city hippy in every fashion capital this season, steeped in the nostalgia of rambling road trips and sandy summer days. At Chloé, creative director Natacha Ramsay-Levi was all about incorporating summer keepsakes (such as anklets, market scarves and magpie-worthy trinkets) into a back-to-work uniform at Jil Sander, Loewe and (of course) Missoni, joyous and multicoloured crochet with home-spun appeal was crafted into beautifully cut trophy pieces while Carolina Herrera incorporated the flower-power aesthetic to patchwork suede boots.Far from thrifty, these pieces were polished. The best example came from Marni creative director Francesco Risso, who went down the road of souvenir chic with several looks featuring postcard-like pictures, but executed it in sculpted satin and pencil skirts with decadently embellished trim and decadent charm belts. Elsewhere, the most distinctive of bohemian summer coverups, the cotton kaftan, was reimagined in silk at Richard Quinn, Oscar de la Renta and Saint Laurent.The elevation of the ordinary has become commonplace on the catwalks (blame Vetements and Balenciaga wunderkind Demna Gvasalia who, for example, has single-handedly re-established the anorak as a must-have) and this season designers’ attentions have turned to surfing.Given fashion’s ongoing penchant for late-90s to early 00s fashion, it makes sense that board shorts would make a comeback right about now too. R13, Sportmax, and Anna Sui all rode the crest of the wave. In their wake came scuba suits at Calvin Klein, rash-guard inspired tops at Richard Malone, and knitwear featuring surf motif intarsia at Michael Kors.Suits may have dominated the street style over fashion week, but on the catwalk, skirts reigned supreme. The silhouette of choice for springsummer 2019 is that shape so synonymous with the 1920s: the drop waist. Favoured for its insouciant, relaxed and languid sensibility, it sauntered down the runways of Anna Sui, Carolina Herrera, Vacquera, Molly Goddard and Hugo Boss.At Erdem and Rodarte, they were cut from rich and sumptuous lengths of taffeta – an approach contrasted by Proenza Schouler, where waists came dropped in denim, proving that this is a trend that works whatever the occasion.It’s all about the details next season, and two polar opposite ones in particular. First up: big bows were big news. Rodarte, Erdem, Miu Miu and Emilia Wickstead were the most distinctive adopters of this trend (the latter creating the most satisfyingly perfect fixtures for her models hair) striking an overtly feminine and lavish note.At the other end of the spectrum, models came armed with holsters. Call it the Virgil effect (the designer went big on them for his Louis Vuitton menswear debut in July) or call it a sign of female empowerment, but designers presented them in myriad form.At Calvin Klein, primary-coloured leather styles were worn over blazers Sies Marjan partnered his with tonal suits styled around the shoulders at Fendi, a belt version was worn to toughen up a classic dress while Gabriela Hearst, House of Holland, Michael Kors and Chloé all used it as a statement accent.The utilitarian theme marched through the collections to a resounding approval from the fashion press. At Givenchy, Clare Waight Keller hit her stride at the fashion house delivering a knockout collection full of functional patch-pocket trousers and sharply tailored separates that were punctuated with with D-ring belts Dries van Noten featured army-green twill and dresses with drawstring halternecks and elsewhere, Burberry (utility shirts), Tory Burch (precision-pressed tops) and Fendi (combat pants) all signed up.Part Ibizan bohemian, part Glastonbury reveller, nothing strikes a summer party note quite like tie-dye. This trend had a strong thread from the start of the shows: in New York, Calvin Klein and R13 enticed showgoers with their rainbow hues in London, Ashley Williams represented with bewitching black and in Milan, No.21 went neon and Mrs Prada put it on her signature A-line skirts.Not to be outdone, Paris gave it a twist of its own, with Christian Dior, Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood and Paco Rabanne all stretching out the party vibe until next spring.It wasn’t just about the clothes at the shows. Several designers went all out with their spectacles for their moment in the spotlight, shifting the focus away from their sartorial creations. At Gucci, Alessandro Michele eschewed the runway for a theatre where models meandered around the stalls before making their way the stage for the finale at Christian Dior, creative director Maria Grazia got choreographer Sharon Eyal to mastermind a dance prelude to the show, which took place in a pop-up space on the outskirts of Paris and Giorgio Armani invited guests out to Milan Linate airport where, after entering through security, they were transported to the fashion house’s hanger where they were serenaded by Robbie Williams.Anthony Vaccarello at Saint Laurent also got in on the action, staging his catwalk on water at the Place du Trocadéro in Paris, while Ralph Lauren took over the Bethesda Terrace in Central Park to stage his 50th anniversary show. Also in New York, Telfar opted for an outside location on the banks of the East River (open air, in the rain) and created a vocal sound collage by South African performance artists Faka and Ian Isiah featuring Selah Marley and Austin Williamson.But it was Anya Hindmarch who really stole this show by opting not to show any clothes or accessories at all. Her Chubby Cloud installation at Banqueting House (which was also open to the public) comprised the world’s biggest white beanbag, which attendees sat on as they were serenaded by BBC newsreader Zeb Soanes reading a special shipping forecast and the Eric Whitacre Singers – and not a single fashion item in sight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0ee21f52deb099b783e6d290dd95a1dbb2400e/0_10_2280_1368/master/2280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb8784b0fdef0434bbbd8ef5d4d9bf0","title":"ryan gosling movies ranked first man la la land","story":"Whether crooning in La La Land or essaying a blank would-be killer, the First Man star is capable of keeping all his characters’ contradictions on displayEven The Notebook’s writer, Nicholas Sparks, knew that there wasn’t much to Noah, the romantically deranged, mansion-restoring, beard-growing war veteran in this insipid tearjerker. “It’s a guy who falls in love and then he just kinda does nothing,” he admitted. But director Nick Cassavetes had sound reasons for choosing Ryan Gosling. “You’re not handsome, you’re not cool, you’re just a regular guy who looks a bit nuts,” he told him.Annoyingly kooky comedy in which the lonely Lars (Gosling) introduces his close-knit Midwestern community to his girlfriend, Bianca, who happens to be a life-sized rubber doll. Avoiding sleaziness by the skin of its teeth – it is only right he and Bianca don’t sleep together, Lars explains, since they’re both religious – this settles eventually for the tone of the self-help manual (“What we call mental illness … can be a way to work something out”).As the junior manager of a Democrat governor’s presidential campaign, Gosling gets to chart the slow curdling of idealism into disillusionment. He is part of a cast that’s so strong and starry (Philip Seymour Hoffmann, Marisa Tomei, Paul Giamatti, the film’s director, George Clooney) that it takes a good 30 minutes to notice that the film is all gloss and no grit.Middle-of-the-road, multi-strand romcom with Gosling as the pick-up artist who gives Steve Carell, newly separated from Julianne Moore, lessons in love before himself falling for Emma Stone. Notable for the fizzy rapport between Gosling and Stone in the first of their three collaborations to date.Neil Armstrong was notoriously reserved, but there is a thin line between enigmatic and empty, and Gosling, in his second film for La La Land director Damien Chazelle, isn’t always on the right side of it. There is grim humour, though, in the formal, buttoned-up way he addresses his children the night before he makes history: “We have every confidence in this mission.”Or: The Place Beyond Self-Parody. Gosling descends into feigned inarticulacy and mumbling method madness as a tattooed fairground stunt rider reconnecting with an old flame (played by his real-life wife, Eva Mendes). He is weirdly unable here to suggest the character’s dopiness without winking at the audience. There is just too much self-awareness: the lights are off but there’s still somebody home.This retro-flavoured musical reunites Gosling and Stone, but delivers one anticlimax after another: the opening traffic-jam showstopper is like a poor man’s Fame, the songs throughout more Magic FM than magical. But Gosling, who plays a pig-headed pianist earning a crust playing easy-listening standards, gets one of the highlights to himself, casually singing the tentative City of Stars as he strolls along a pier at night.Gosling’s signature role as a nameless stuntman-cum-getaway-driver. (“What do you do?” someone asks him. “I drive,” comes the Zen reply.) He gets a long way on his mute charisma, those feminine features so unlikely for a male action hero, and the ability to look fetching in a snazzy silver jacket. The film, though, is a bust: all flashy bodywork and no gas in the tank.Eye-catching early psycho-work from Gosling and Michael Pitt as the young Nietzsche-adoring students conspiring to commit the perfect murder. Sandra Bullock is on their tail in this partial retread of the Leopold and Loeb case that inspired Rope, Compulsion and Swoon.This modern-day Hamlet, set among US expats in Bangkok, re-teamed director Nicolas Winding Refn with Gosling following the success of Drive. The actor plays Julian, an impotent would-be avenger unable to kill his brother’s murderer Kristin Scott-Thomas offers bleach-blond comic relief as his taunting, incestuously inclined mother. Gosling’s performance is an exercise in studied blankness: you cannot tell if he’s acting or under anaesthetic.Gosling’s haunted, sorrowful face is a good fit for this moody sequel. He also has some pleasing chemistry with his blade-running predecessor, Harrison Ford, with whom he trades pointless punches before Ford finally says: “We could keep at this or we could get a drink.” The men duly drop their fists and repair to the bar. Would that more movie dust-ups ended that way.Gosling and Russell Crowe had both played violent, shaven-headed fascists early in their careers (Gosling in The Believer, Crowe in Romper Stomper), but by the time they teamed up for a missing persons investigation in Shane Black’s rambunctious comic thriller, they couldn’t have been more different. Gosling was now delicate and goofy, as light on his toes as a ballerina, while Crowe was an ungainly, unshaven lump. That mismatch lends the film its spark.With nearly a decade of family-entertainment wholesomeness behind him, it was useful for Gosling to have a calling-card role that drew a line definitively between his Mickey Mouse Club past and his adult future. Nothing could have done the job better than The Believer, an intense psychological thriller based on the real case of a Jewish neo-Nazi. The movie displayed early and incontrovertible evidence of the Gosling USP: an ability to hold a character’s contradictions and conflicts in view at all times.Gosling and his co-star Michelle Williams lived together while preparing to play lovers on the rocks in Derek Cianfrance’s gruelling marital drama. The fragmentary, non-chronological structure allows them to inhabit the happiness and optimism of the couple’s salad days as emphatically as the despair that later comes to overwhelm them. It’s as pleasurable watching them fall in love as it is excruciating seeing them fall apart.Think of this as Drugged Poets Society or To Sir, With Crack. As the drug-addicted Dan Dunne, a teacher who puts the “high” in high school, Gosling gives a frazzled but nuanced performance whether he is grandstanding in class or slipping into inaccessible corners of his own mind. His friendship with a pupil (Shareeka Epps), and his attempts to save her from a local dealer, provide the core of the drama, but the film is alive with curious, devastating details. Best of all is the scene in which Dan is approached by the father of a former pupil. The man wants to share the good news of his daughter’s recent academic achievement, and to congratulate this teacher who set her on the right path, but from within his druggy funk Dan simply cannot be reached.First Man is in UK cinemas from 12 October• This article was amended on 11 Oct 2017.

As the biopic Stan \u0026amp Ollie premieres, the former  film critic still cherishes the memoryAs someone who met Orson Welles, Luis Buñuel, John Ford, Satyajit Ray, Howard Hawks, Katharine Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin and many others in the course of a long stint as the ’s film critic, I am often asked who was my favourite movie star. The answer is none of them. My favourites are Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Mind you, I was in my mid-teens when I met them, which probably led to the kind of adolescent hero worship I might later have abjured.My mother had taken me to the London Coliseum to see them perform. It was 1947 and they were in their 50s, with 20 years as a double act under their belts. It was the matinee of a variety show and they were top of the bill Elsie and Doris Waters, a pair of well-loved comedians – known as Gert and Daisy – and Rawicz and Landauer – famous piano duettists who played Chopin twice as fast as anybody else – were on the undercard.I can’t say that Laurel and Hardy were at their very best. Maybe the stage was not their natural habitat, although they were still treading the boards together well into the 1950s, as seen in the new biopic Stan \u0026amp Ollie, in which Steve Coogan and John C Reilly play the pair during their gruelling final tour of Britain. But I was thrilled to bits just to see them and I asked my mother at the interval whether I could meet them. She asked the theatre manager and he came back with a note. It said: “Yes, but don’t bring your mother …”The manager took me to the door of their dressing room and knocked, but left before Hardy answered the door. “Come in, young man,” he said. “We have tea and buns on the way for you. This is Stan, by the way, as you can see by his hat. He seldom takes its off, even in bed.”I was tongue-tied. But when the tray of tea and buns came in, I tucked in enthusiastically. Whereupon Hardy took a bun from the tray, placed it on his chair and sat on it. It was, of course, squashed flat. I’m pretty sure he did it to amuse me. But you never knew with Hardy, who preferred playing golf to working.Laurel looked horrified, especially when Hardy offered the flat bun to me. He was the master of most situations and the pair’s directors invariably deferred to him on set. He was also the British one, born in Ulverston, Lancashire, in 1890, and was once employed by the music-hall impresario Fred Karno as an understudy to Chaplin. Hardy was born in 1892 in Harlem, Georgia and drawn to the movies from his teens.It was clear that they were ageing. The cheers that welcomed them at the theatre, which was three-quarters full, were not so enthusiastic when they left the stage, which may be why they were prepared to entertain a young boy so anxious to see them. If so, they gave no sign of that to me.They were determined to entertain me and they did so royally, asking me about my school, the subjects I liked and whether I preferred the theatre or the cinema. When I told them I often went to the newsreel cinema on Victoria station, which invariably had a Laurel and Hardy short, along with the boring documentaries and songs, they were clearly very pleased. And they told me that many countries had different names for them. In Iran, they were called the Fat and the Skinny in Poland, Flip and Flap in Germany, Chubby and Dumb and, best of all, in India, Stout and Worrywart.We spent almost an hour together before they called for the manager, who took me back to my mother, who was waiting impatiently in the foyer. I will never forget that flat bun, or the stories they told me about appearing on television and being informed that they were being introduced to 6 million people: “That will take rather a long time,” said Laurel. Another of his gags I recall from that day was: “I was dreaming I was awake, but I woke up and found myself asleep.”But it was never verbal jokes that defined the pair. It was the extraordinary way they dovetailed, almost telepathically. No one did double-takes better than Hardy and few did weeping at fate’s enormity better than Laurel. They once did a short film in which they used 3,000 cream pies, most of which were upended over Hardy.But it wasn’t the pies that most intrigued me. In another short, the pair sat together in the front seats of an old car that Hardy couldn’t start. And, for a full three minutes they managed to make everyone laugh, just by the various expressions on their faces. It was a masterpiece of comedy I shall never forget, and so was the little dance they did together at the end of their Oscar-winning film The Music Box. Just meeting them was one of the most cherishable moments of my life.Stan \u0026amp Ollie is at the Embankment Garden Cinema and Curzon Mayfair, London, on 21 October, as part of the London film festival. It will be released in the UK in January 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc47034a10cd52748219cfc80c357a5ff399f98/0_247_3876_2325/master/3876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6057991b57df4dc37fecc1526610d79","title":"kombucha can the fermented drink compete with beer at the bar","story":"The health beverage has already made the leap from health store to cafes – and now it’s on offer in pubs as an alternative to boozeWhen I was a child, homebrew meant the beer my grandad produced under his stairs. Come Christmas, my father and uncles would congregate there, holding up cloudy beer mugs to the light and nodding appreciatively.Increasingly, however, home brewers are knocking out kombucha instead – a traditional, non-alcoholic drink made with fermented tea.Take Jonny Wilkinson, one of England’s best-loved rugby stars. Rugby types may be better known as prolific beer drinkers, but Wilkinson has been brewing his own kombucha for four years. He says introducing fermented items into his diet has brought “a lightness, less conflict in my gut and a more alert, flowing nature to everything”. In May, he launched his own brand, No1 Kombucha, in Sainsbury’s with the intention of bringing the naturally fizzy soft drink to the masses.He is not the only one on such a mission. The fast-food chain Leon now stocks Suffolk-brewed kombucha from LA Brewery, while another British brand, Real Kombucha, will soon be rolled out in 320 Fuller’s pubs. In less than a year, Real Kombucha has reached “almost 50 Michelin-starred restaurants, almost 300 top hotels and 55 Laines pubs”, according to its founder, David Begg.The drink’s leap from health stores to the mainstream via hipster cafes has been swift. LA Kombucha’s founder, Louise Avery, was partly responsible for the drink’s graduation in the UK from murky cult endeavour to cafe culture. She began by brewing it at home under the brand Lois \u0026amp the Living Teas. “About five years ago, I started bringing up these cloudy milk bottles of kombucha to beautiful cafes around Islington and Hackney in London and they would strain it and serve it to customers.” It flew off the shelves, word spread and Yauatcha, a dim sum restaurant in Soho, came knocking.Many of these cafe owners had come to London from abroad – Germany, Australia, Canada – and were already familiar with kombucha. Avery says British proprietors were more sceptical, “because there’d be bits floating in it, like yeast people were a bit scared and disgusted. I had to explain it’s a live food and it will continue to grow.” In response, she took steps to make her product more palatable to mass-market consumers. “I figured out a way of mildly filtering it and adding a bit of carbonation to suspend the bacteria I make sure it’s chilled and I give it a short shelf life to keep as much bacteria as I can without it being an explosive product with bits floating in it.”It worked. When LA Kombucha launched in June, Avery sold 2,000 bottles. The next month, sales rose to 10,000 within six months, Leon had signed up and she had to build a second brewery.Promising scientific findings into how our gut affects everything from mental health to autoimmune disease have boosted demand for so-called gut-healthy fermented products such as kefir (a yoghurt drink), kimchi (Korean-style fermented cabbage) and kombucha, which probably originated in China. The brewing process for kombucha is relatively simple. Tea (either green, black or a mix of both), sugar and filtered water are sealed with a slimy-looking cellulose mat called a Scoby (this stands for “symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast”). Scobys, which you can buy on eBay, are produced naturally by bacteria and contain the necessary micro-organisms to kick off kombucha fermentation. You float this biofilm on your mixture and let it brew for between seven and 30 days, depending on atmospheric conditions and personal taste. The tea itself ferments, while the yeasts turn the sugar into alcohol, which the bacteria converts into acetic acid, making carbon dioxide bubbles in the process. The longer it brews, the less sweet and more vinegary it becomes.Kombucha’s twangy taste can be enhanced by adding fruits and spices, and most commercial offerings do this. LA Brewery’s ginger variety is satisfyingly fiery, like a traditional ginger beer with a dash of lemonade and the complex pungent, pickle taste you get with kombucha. No1’s passionfruit and goji is fruity and refreshing. Like LA Brewery and No1, Real Kombucha also comes in three choices, although none of these have added flavours – the differences come from the types of tea used. But all three producers carefully avoid making specific health claims, instead promoting the sensory experience of their drinks as something to be appreciated by connoisseurs.Why not push the health angle? Because, says, Paul Humphreys, professor of applied microbiology at the University of Huddersfield, “all the data is either anecdotal or from animal studies. There are a couple of rat studies around cholesterol and hypertension that show potential.” The only human clinical case studies published, he says, tend to be one-off events with negative effects such as people getting acidosis – when there’s too much acid in the body – possibly from drinking too much kombucha.Part of kombucha’s appeal is its live-bacteria element, but the jury is out on how beneficial the microbes in the drink are. Humphreys says there aren’t many “classic probiotic bacteria in it at all. Not the lactobacillus or bifidobacteria, which are the dairy probiotics. You get reports of people finding them in kombucha, but nowhere near what you’d find in some yoghurts or kefir.” That’s not to say that kombucha bacteria aren’t doing good – we just don’t know. And being a wild fermented drink, the yeast and bacteria profiles fluctuate.Humphreys brews his own kombucha at home as an alternative to soft drinks and alcohol. A number of brands have sent their products to his lab for analysis but, he says: “I would never make any health claims based on what we’ve found. I wouldn’t even infer them. It’s such a complicated product.” He prefers his kombucha sour and believes the commercial versions leave in more sugar than you would find in the traditional drink. “It’s lost in the mists of time, but these fermentations were originally about making water safe to drink, so they were probably quite acidic.”Being big on yeast, however, the drink does offer B vitamins, which could be beneficial if you’re deficient. It also contains some vitamin C. And there are polyphenols – plant micronutrients that are antioxidant-rich and feed the good bacteria in your gut. These come from the tea itself, but could be more beneficial in kombucha than in a regular cuppa. Whether the microbiological benefits can be proven or not, there is the undeniable advantage that commercial kombuchas often contain less than one third (or less than half with No1) of the sugar of regular soft drinks, and no artificial sweeteners. And if they help heavy drinkers cut down on alcohol consumption, there’s another win. This is precisely what Begg is hoping, as Real Kombucha hits pubs and bars up and down the UK. “We approached it entirely as an alcohol replacement,” he says. “We are in the space of champagne, wine, craft beer.”Rather than compare his products with soft drinks, Begg places them “somewhere between a fruity prosecco or a lighter dry cider”. Sommeliers have been enlisted to proffer food-pairing tips. The young leaves of “first flush” Darjeeling tea, used in his Royal Flush kombucha, produce notes of raspberry, rhubarb, blackcurrant and, he says, “a little bit of white peach, in the flavour profile”. It’s certainly interesting and strong enough to be sipped, occupying your senses as much any alcoholic beverage.Another in the range is called Smokehouse because the black tea from the hills of southern China tastes a little smoky, but the apple and caramel flavours it produces mean people associate it with cider. The only things missing, says Begg, “are the legs or potency of alcohol, but Royal Flush does even have a slightly puckering astringency in the background”.Begg’s first encounter with kombucha was a friend’s home brew, and it immediately satisfied the craving for alcohol he had been experiencing. He had largely given up booze, but didn’t want sweet soft drinks or water when he went out socially. Avery agrees: “Alcohol plays on a number of receptors and kombucha has that, too. Umami, sour, sweetness you have the fizziness and viscosity that sits on your tongue.” Whether pubgoers will order it instead of booze is yet to be seen, but, says Begg: “We’ve done it in restaurants – expanding well across the upper end as a wine replacement. Now, we’re saying the pub is the next bastion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c7e67ae43d9be67d1b9c882438d893c8dfaa44/472_205_2307_1385/master/2307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a71cfaad852e251fde876442c2fe5df","title":"real madrid sue newspaper cristiano ronaldo","story":"Real Madrid say they have taken legal action against a Portuguese newspaper that reported the Spanish club forced Cristiano Ronaldo to settle with the woman who accused him of rape.The club say the information published by the Correio da Manhã newspaper is “categorically false” and was printed in an effort to “seriously damage the image of this club.”Real Madrid says they have “absolutely no knowledge of any of the information that the newspaper published with regard to the player Cristiano Ronaldo, and therefore the club was unable to take action on a matter of which it had no knowledge.”Correio da Manhã published an article on Wednesday saying that part of Ronaldo’s defence will be to say that Real Madrid forced him to settle.

Make no mistake, the winger’s call-up is a big deal for English football and could mark a turning point for young English players.There has been talk for many years about the lack of opportunities given to young domestic talent, especially at the top clubs, and whether it is good for their development and that of the national team for them to be sitting on the bench or going out on loan to a club in a lower league. One suggestion has been that more should go abroad but few have, partly because they and those around them have feared it would lead to their chances with England becoming compromised. Step forward Sancho to show that does not have to be the case.Here we have an 18-year-old who is doing well at Borussia Dortmund, a big club in a fast-paced, intense, high-quality league and on the back of that he has been rewarded with a call up for his country. Southgate has clearly been watching Sancho play for Dortmund and brought him into his squad for the games against Croatia and Spain. By doing that he has also sent out a wider message, namely he is watching all English players, including those who are abroad. That is so important because it tells young players at clubs such as Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United there is alternative to just sitting and waiting for their opportunity. Rather they can “do a Sancho”, go to another country entirely and potentially still be picked by England.It’s a move that can also benefit players who are getting some playing time for club and country. Take Marcus Rashford. It’s clear he is not comfortable in front of goal at the moment. He is snatching at chances, possibly because he is worried about putting a foot wrong under José Mourinho. He is regressing in his club career and, as Jamie Carragher suggested a while back, perhaps does need to leave United. But they are unlikely to sell him to another top-six Premier League club and he is too good for a lower-league side, so another obvious option is abroad.He probably isn’t ready for Real Madrid or Barcelona – and they probably are not interested in him either – but he could do well at a club such as Dortmund. The Bundesliga side may not be at the level of Real or Barça, or Bayern Munich for that matter, but it is still a place where there is pressure to perform week in, week out and he will get regular playing time. Such an environment would test Rashford, as it has tested Sancho. The fact he has flourished says so much about him, especially given he is only 18.Sancho is clearly a major talent with great dribbling ability and goalscoring prowess. I heard Rio Ferdinand singing his praises recently, saying he has everything to succeed at the highest level, and there are definite similarities with Raheem Sterling in regards to how he plays. As much as Sancho is lucky to be able to play for Dortmund, they are lucky to have a player with his qualities and potential.Moving abroad will also benefit Sancho as a person. As I can testify, living in a foreign country takes you way out of your comfort zone. It’s the little things, like ordering food in a different language, buying petrol or learning to drive on the other side of the road, but they all add up to making you a more rounded, educated person. Sancho will take so much from being in Germany – it can only benefit him.In regards to the Nations League in general, I have to disagree with Jürgen Klopp’s description of it as a “senseless” competition. An opportunity to play for your country is never senseless and especially when the games are competitive. They mean more and will only help those who take part before competing at major tournaments, such as the World Cup. Klopp should respect that and, in general, it is never a good thing when club managers comment negatively on international football.Speaking of international football, I was impressed with how the England women performed in their 1-1 draw with Australia on Wednesday, having also impressed in the 1-0 win against Brazil. It was a really great performance against Australia, with lots of entries into the opposition box and they would have got more out of it in regard to the result had it not been for the referee, who missed two clear penalties.Phil Neville was very critical about the standard of refereeing in women’s football. Yes there were some really bad decisions in the game but I have seen some really bad decisions from referees in men’s games, too. It happens and hopefully Florence Guillemin, the French official who was in charge at Craven Cottage on Tuesday, looks at the decisions she made and learns from them.As for England’s display, Fran Kirby was once again excellent and proved why she has deservedly received the Ballon d’Or nomination. I spoke to Fran earlier this year and thanked her for being such a joy to play with last season and told her to expect a nomination. In typical humble fashion she laughed it off, so I am delighted to see it has now become a reality.Having scored with a fantastic header against Brazil she showed great technique to score against Australia and is now that key player for England like she is for Chelsea, which is what England will need at the World Cup next year.Fran fully deserves that recognition and is in great company with other Chelsea nominees Eden Hazard and N’Golo Kanté. Hopefully she goes on to win the prize."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/174a15a8ff5d73515dd3e0a51d33dabc1e92c6ce/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4213623f0bb0a4df592a852df3d77eb1","title":"next generation 2018 60 of the best young talents in world football","story":"From Lilian Thuram’s son to Real Madrid-bound Rodrygo and the ‘Croatian Neymar’, the  picks 60 of the most talented players born in 2001.

The photo-sharing app revolutionised smartphone photography by giving users a series of filters. You could flick through your options (moody Sierra, cosy Nashville, or nostalgic Valencia?) and in an instant everyone was able to look like a professional photographer.Don’t ‘over back’ it “The biggest mistake people make when uploading pictures is effectively ‘over backing’ the image,” explains Francesca, a 16-year-old with just over 1,000 followers. “This is when someone over-edits the photo and the result is tacky.”This is such a key lesson to learn that if Instagram had a constitution, “Don’t over-edit” would be the No 1 rule, and the punishment would be zero likes. “A lot of people put way too many filters on a picture,” says Vinnie Cohen, a 14-year-old with nearly 2,500 followers.“I used to want to go out with loads of cameras and stuff but it’s too much, the image looks forced, it looks too professional, it doesn’t look authentic.”Don’t mess up the captionA picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes words are worth a thousand pictures (which are worth a thousand words). So it’s important to make sure that you get the caption right.“Never say ‘cool’ or ‘lol’ – that’s so five years ago,” advises Molly Gibson, a 14-year-old who uses the app to post pictures of her friends. “And don’t like comments on other people’s posts – it makes you look like a stalker with loads of free time.”Francesca’s most popular post was a simple shot in her family home, but she believes it got so many likes because the caption was about saying goodbye to her friends after her GCSEs. “The best captions tell a story,” she says.Download editing appsThe Instagram filter is dead – long live the non-Instagram filter. Isla Brewer, a 15-year-old with roughly 2,000 followers, recommends VCSO and Afterlight as alternative editing apps.“The best filters on Afterlight for me are Woods, Flora and Cape,” she says. “On VSCO, my favourite filters are A6, HB1 and P5.” If that sounds a little complicated, don’t worry – Isla says pictures with no filter are “a huge thing right now”.If you forgo the filter, Isla recommends Snapseed to make small adjustments for brightness and contrast. “The Selective tool is also very useful if there are certain parts of the image you need to make adjustments to,” she says. “I always try to crop my pictures 4x5, because then it takes up more space on the feed.”Forgo a theme – and think in threesA few short years ago, anyone who was anyone had an Instagram “theme”. In short, this meant all their pictures matched a certain aesthetic – the same colours, borders, or angles were used in every shot. Nowadays, however, it’s all about the rule of threes.“The best tip I can give for curation is to remember your profile shows your photos in sets of threes,” Francesca says, “so it is important to make sure sets of three images look good together and don’t clash – it can ruin your profile.”The most important thing to remember – Molly says – is that you shouldn’t “spam” your followers by posting too much. “Otherwise people will get bored and you won’t get as many likes.”Location, location, locationIn case it needs stating, the backdrop for your photo is important. “The colours in your picture do have to semi-match,” warns Vinnie. “Obviously you’ve got to match your background with your outfit a little bit.” The teen advises against “random colours all over the place” and “loads of random people in the background”.Isla adds that angles are everything. “Before I take any pictures, the first thing I’ll do is take a look on Pinterest to give me ideas for poses and backgrounds. Then I’ll take a few practice shots.“I like to take around 100-200 photos before making a decision.”Get time on your sideAll agree there’s little more important than the timing for uploading your photo.“It’s important to post your photo when your followers are most likely to be on their phone,” Francesca says. That means first thing in the morning or at night (Isla likes to post between 6pm and 8pm).“If you don’t do this your post will most likely be ‘drowned’ by other people’s.”Be yourselfVinnie worries that popular posts are often devoid of personality, and is working hard to make sure his pictures say more about him and his life.“I know a lot of people who go out of their way to take pictures, but for me I feel like you get a much purer image of what you want from just finding it in your daily routine,” he says.“I want to portray an image that I feel is true to what I am, instead of just what people want to see.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53efb5bcbe0e31b0cd8cd53a12a39d55b697f039/1167_388_793_476/master/793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83244ae88d43ef66f040b233427c664","title":"teens without screens one familys attempt to rein in mobile phone usage","story":"How would writer  John Lewis and his family fare when they tried to limit their mobile phone usage? We challenged him to limit his family’s mobile usage for a week. Could it bring them closer? This is his diary.SaturdayWe are sitting down to dinner, all four of us, something that only happens a few times a week. My 13-year-old son Harry has his headphones on and is giggling at a YouTube video on his phone, occasionally getting cables caught up in his fork. My 16-year-old daughter Laurie is also multitasking as she eats, scrolling through memes on Instagram and getting flecks of fish curry on her screen.This is no way to eat a meal.My wife and I once tried restricting mobile phone use. We turned off the wifi at night, but my children used their phones in bed and ate through their data allowance in a couple of days. Looking at my family, though, it’s obvious we need to address the situation again. This time, we’ll do it using the “contract” about family phone usage that Tesco Mobile has devised with family tech expert Andy Robertson.“Right,” I announce, in my best Victorian Father voice. “The entire family is going to reduce its reliance on mobiles.”After much mocking laughter, we eventually agree on some basic rules. No phones at the dinner table. We will try to limit our mobile phone use. The children won’t accept friend requests from – or talk online to – anyone they don’t know. And this time, to avoid nocturnal data problems, everyone will leave their phone in another room when it comes to bedtime.SundaySitting on the sofa, I realise that I am baffled by what my children really do while pretending to watch their favourite TV shows.“What are you actually looking at?” I ask my daughter, whose face is glued to her phone.“Just … stuff. Instagram. Tumblr. WhatsApp. I can’t actually watch TV on its own. I have to have something else to do.”“This,” says my wife, “is why I used to smoke.”To distract our children from their phones, we play board games for the evening. It actually works – although, after an hour of hilarity and excitement, the game descends into rage, bitterness and tantrums.MondayWe are on holiday abroad. Within minutes of stopping at a restaurant or museum, the children have worked out the wifi password and are busy scrolling through Instagram and watching YouTube videos.So we pledge to completely avoid phone use when out and about. For a couple of hours, this is great – they engage with the sights, photograph buildings, ask questions and patiently listen as I bluff my answers. And then we get hopelessly lost and end up having to resort to Google Maps to navigate our way around the city.TuesdayIt is evening in the holiday apartment, and we play cards. As the only games we can actually play are Snap and Go Fish, we try to learn the rules to poker. Of course, we have to look them up online, on our phones, and have to repeatedly check back on whether a flush beats a straight.WednesdayWe continue our lengthy poker session. My wife and I are surprised when my son clarifies some of the more arcane rules and then explains, in great detail, how to play a variant of poker called Texas hold ‘em. It turns out that he has been playing a Texas hold ‘em app on his phone for much of the day. We have unwittingly created a gambling expert.ThursdayThanks to this experiment making me engage with my children’s phone usage far more, I realise that I now know what my children actually do on their phones. My son plays ridiculous shoot-em-up games, discovers obscure music on Spotify and YouTube, and watches endless drumming tutorials. He is also adept at quickly looking up information to use as ammunition in an argument, making him invariably right about all sorts of things.My daughter is scrolling through endless memes on social media and watching episodes of John Oliver and Trevor Noah giggling at comedy videos about history or playing logic puzzles or quizzes on the Sporcle website.During our holiday she read an entire playscript in German on her phone. Frankly, this is a relief. My wife and I have long lived in fear that dark forces on the internet could be preying on her, so we’re far happier with the German theatre discovery.FridayThe week is now over. Cutting down on phone use has not been easy. You realise how reliant we are on them for things such as maps and basic information.But I’ve realised something: there’s no problem with this. The problem is the kind of listless, passive reliance on your mobile for the sake of it. Restricting phone use actually reminds you that the internet is quite amazing. You could be learning Italian on Duolingo, teaching yourself how to change the oil in your car using an online tutorial, reading thousands of academic papers, or watching countless arts documentaries.I pick up my phone, flick through social media and consider getting into a furious political argument with someone on Twitter. Instead, I put the phone away and start reading a book. I should do this more often.Photography: Laura McCluskey for Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14e8cc442f0336f97021e51d6f43226d3b185a6/0_2_2278_1367/master/2278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c5fbe609d04b79f46e587991ba7953b","title":"forget politics ultimate showdown taylor swift kanye west","story":"One has come out for the Democrats, the other is a lunch guest at the White House. Has everything else been just a run-up to this clash of the titans?Encouraging news from the country of America, where the antidote to the problem of a TV-celebrity president is clear. More celebrity. Hey – what’s the worst that could happen?More celebrity, different celebrities, bigger celebrities – never let it be said that the elite centre is out of ideas. They’re certainly not out of celebrities. Now that Oprah has crushed their fever dreams and stated clearly that she won’t run for president, the search simply moves to other entertainers who could move the dial – just like entertainers have always moved the dial in US politics, according to data I seem unable to lay my hands on but is clearly out there, no matter how many times the tactic ultimately correlates with situations in which a gaggle of stars break their promise to move to Canada.When journalism goes tits up (next Easter?), I plan to found a left-leaning political consultancythinktank called The Institute of Celebrity Studies, which tells politicians exactly what they want to hear about how important celebrities are to whichever social and economic programme on which they’ve set their little hearts. Join me. You can tell them how the celebrities connect with the voters emotionally, how they reach down mines in the way that ideas can’t, how this influencer called Russell Brand won the presidency of England for one guy. By the time it gets to election night and the bed gets shat, the candidate has already paid you. And you know what? Don’t even feel bad about it. You gave them a great party. Tell me some other way they’re going to get on stage with Beyoncéhave their picture taken with Lena Dunhamaccess Russell Brand’s kitchen that doesn’t end in a restraining order.Anyway, on with the show. The latest celebrity to be hailed as the answer to the question “who can stop us losing?” is Taylor Swift. Sunday night saw Swift exhort her Instagram followers to vote in the upcoming midterms, in a post which also endorsed her native Tennessee’s Democratic Senate hopeful Phil Bredesen. This event has been glossed with that most ecstatically grateful of journalistic cliches: the breaking of a silence. Taylor Swift has broken her silence. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, Swift’s studied neutrality on politics drove commentators quite mad, with endless thinkpieces churned out on the morality of her declining to say which way she was voting. The volume of rubbish written about why the pop singer didn’t break her silence could have created 40,000 landfill jobs in swing states. Counterpoint thinkpieces suggesting that, lyrically, Taylor had made her affiliations perfectly clear. (To some extent, I agree: Blank Space is about write-in candidates and you will get tired of arguing about this before I do.)But let us return to the present day. Barely 24 hours after the Instagram post, Swift used one of multiple acceptance speeches at the American Music Awards to double down on her message to people to vote. “This award, and every single award given out tonight, were voted on by the people,” Taylor pointed out as she picked up artist of the year and prepared for a gear-crunching local radio link. “And you know what else is voted on by the people? The midterm elections on November 6. Get out and vote. I love you guys.”According to vote.org, the non-partisan organisation which registers people to vote and which Swift named in her post, a welter of registrations followed – especially from young people. This has been taken positively by some Democrats, though various pollsters have warned against regarding Swift as a positive market-mover for the Democrats in Tennessee. If her intervention nationalises the race, that may be to the Republican incumbent’s advantage.Should the Republicans be worried more generally about stars coming out for their opponents? It must be said that Republicans have historically been intensely relaxed about celebrities endorsing the Democrats. Indeed, it often feels like the only people yet to realise just how intensely relaxed are the celebrities themselves, who find the idea that they could be something other than electorally covetable quite unfathomable. Although not as unfathomable as the idea that they may actually move the dial in the other direction.Enraging much of his own base in a different way, meanwhile, is postmodernism’s Kanye West, whose decision to go rogue on the celebrity community is now so advanced that he met Trump at the White House today. Kanye had lunch with the president, as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. In advance of the meeting, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, stated they would discuss matters such as prison reform – Kushner may feel he has an increasing interest in this subject – how to prevent gang violence, how to reduce violence in Chicago and manufacturing resurgence in the US. West’s recent call for the repeal of the 13th amendment, which abolished slavery, appeared to be off the table.Even so, this is quite the summit, and with Taylor now coming out for the Democrats, an indication that perhaps we’ve been looking at things the wrong way. Far from the story of the past tumultuous few years being of elites v the left behind, or open v closed, it is highly possible that the central value ide is Taylor v Kanye, and has been ever since he interrupted her 2009 VMA acceptance speech for best video. Everything else – even Trump – has in fact been merely leading up to this ultimate showdown. This is the real battle. The other stuff was just the undercard.Something to think about, anyway. In the meantime, other shakedowns are occurring. According to various reports, West’s longtime friends and supporters Jay-Z and Beyoncé have had quite their limit of his nonsense, and are distancing themselves from him and wife Kim Kardashian, who herself has had a couple of meetings in the White House. Down in the B-list, meanwhile, the debate is threatening to turn violent, with Kanye detractor Lana Del Rey deploying a double negative against Kanye supporter Azealia Banks. “u know the addy,” Lana said to Azealia on the internet. “Pull up anytime. Say it to my face. But if I were you, I wouldn’t. I won’t not fuck you the fuck up. Period.”It wasn’t period, inevitably, and has since descended into a vicious tit-for-tat between the pair about bad plastic surgery, supposed weight gain, fat-shaming, psychiatric illness, OxyContin addiction and racism, to which the only reaction is: can I please go back to 2008?And the answer, alas, is: no, you can’t.Indeed, if you are looking for a way out of 2018 politics, celebrities are unlikely to provide it. I keep hearing that certain types of elites only want to change the world in a way that doesn’t change their world, and the idea that politics needs more celebrity feels very much of a piece with this dated (and failed) sensibility. The biggest star of the reality-TV era is now the most powerful political leader on Earth. Yet his opponents continue to fall upon other celebrities as a potential exit route from the horror. It recalls that bit in The Big Lebowski, where the Dude has just had his head flushed down the toilet by some thugs, and they ask him again where the money is. “It’s down there somewhere,” he deadpans. “Let me take another look.” Maybe the answer to Trump is to take another look down the same U-bend. Or maybe not.For those who absolutely still insist that celebrity endorsementscandidates are the answer, I can only suggest one last roll of the dice: Tom Hanks. Yes, Tom Hanks, whose agents have meticulously curated a career of Great American Stories for him, and who is probably the only celebrity who could walk into a bar anywhere in the United States and have most of the customers fall over themselves to buy him a drink. If he won’t do it – and I would really caution against getting your hopes up – it might be time to pivot away from this community. They have the answers to so many big and important questions – but not, alas, this one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82670f10d81666d206f2d5aea1e16c275ebc668e/0_450_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d06c4dd55839ea44c75288d5f6429faf","title":"introducing the new guardian weekly","story":"Today, I am delighted to reveal a new-look  Weekly, a beautiful magazine featuring our best reporting and writing from around the world.Before the  launched our first website in the mid-1990s, the only way for most readers outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland to read our journalism was in the  Weekly.

Meet the seven K-poppers who won, after wowing both the US and the UKBTS arrive for their first ever UK shows by private jet. They have been using it on the US leg of their world tour, which culminated in a show to 40,000 people at New York’s Citi Field on 6 October, three days before playing to as many people again across two nights at the O2 Arena in London. They have racked up two US No 1 albums and billions of global streams, and were recently invited to the UN as Unicef ambassadors, where their charismatic leader, RM, made a speech, in English, on self-acceptance. Milestones such as these are monumental for any artist, but in reaching them BTS – rappers Suga, RM and J-hope and vocalists Jimin, V, Jin and Jungkook – have changed the face of pop, as the first Korean group to reach the upper echelons of the western music industry.Ethereal-looking Jimin broke down at the end of the Citi Field show. The band have played similar-sized shows in other countries, but the US has always been the final frontier for K-pop – a market that has been attempted many times with only minor successes by acts such as Big Bang, EXO, and 2NE1’s CL. “We feel it all the time,” says Jimin. “On this tour we played some very large venues, and it makes us see that people really love us. Being inundated by all these emotions, it kind of got to me.”In a hotel in London, ahead of the UK shows, security stake out the hallways. Burly men accompany band members to the toilet. BTS have reached that dissociative level of stardom where they are handled like china dolls. “We know that popularity is not for ever,” RM says with a smile. “So we enjoy the ride, the rollercoaster, and when it ends, it just finishes. We’re on the jets and in the stadiums, but I don’t feel like it’s mine. It’s like we just borrowed it from somebody.”BTS are the brainchild of veteran writer and producer Bang Shi Hyuk, who formerly worked at the K-pop entertainment giant JYP, then formed Big Hit Entertainment and debuted BTS in 2013. The normal practice of K-pop is to oversee every element of the life of young “idols”, as they are known in Korea. However, Bang gave BTS autonomy to run their own Twitter and vlog from their studio, and for the rappers to write alongside Big Hit’s in-house production team. Their lyrics are emotionally vulnerable and socially conscious, sometimes bordering on angry, and go against K-pop’s grain: Baepsae, which translates as “silver spoon”, defends their “cursed” generation.Critics have tried to unravel the secret of their US success: many credit social media with spreading their message, but BTS’s fans, known as Army, flag the music and lyrics as the reason they have connected so deeply. It’s this, plus the end of One Direction, the growing interest in K-pop in the US, and BTS’s endless stream of visual content (from behind-the-scenes footage to reality shows) that reel in the curious and hook them with the force of the group’s personalities. In time-honoured boyband fashion, they offer something for everyone.“If it gets too much and it crosses a line, then it can be a source of stress but for me, at least, it’s a sign of their love,” says J-hope, a former street dancer. On a recent album cut, Pied Piper, they playfully admonished the obsessives: “Stop watching and start studying for your exams, your parents and boss hate me … You already have plenty of my pictures in your room.”That surprising honesty – in K-pop terms – underpinned the concept of their recent Love Yourself album trilogy (Her, Tear and Answer), which charted a narrative around, unsurprisingly, learning to love oneself. RM’s speech at the UN echoed this theme: “No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, your gender identity, just speak yourself.” This relatively anodyne statement resonated in South Korea, where the president publicly opposes homosexuality.During their career the band have used Haruki Murakami, Ursula K Le Guin, Jung, Orwell, Nietzsche and Hesse as inspiration. The latter two figure notably in the theory of fate that is woven through Her, whereby love is destined and must therefore be unshakable (only for it to fall apart on Tear). As 80s indie fans did, BTS’s Army now read these writers in order to fully understand the band’s vision, while spending serious money on Bluetooth-programmed light-up sticks for their concerts.For many, however, BTS symbolise an industry that is little more than a high-functioning bubblegum machine. K-pop is perceived as cruel for its intensive training system, which can start when artists are seven years old and last for 10 years with no guarantee of a group debut and for its harsh approach to idols who struggle with exhaustion and their mental health. Many have fainted onstage, while Super Junior’s Leeteuk quietly set up a now-defunct peer group, Milk Club, for idols dealing with depression. Meanwhile, fans are portrayed as mindless teenage girls. “It’s pointless to argue or fight about it,” Suga says, gruffly. “Frankly, I can’t understand people who want to put down a certain type of music, whatever that might be. Classical music was pop music in its own age. It’s a matter of taste and understanding – there’s no good or bad, there’s no highbrow or lowbrow.”BTS’s music began as old-school R\u0026ampB and hip-hop, but has since incorporated a myriad of genres, from EDM to South African house. The lyrics, too, have become increasingly complex, closer to prose than simple moon-June-soon pop. In many respects, BTS fit the mould of a classic boyband – they look and sound great – but they are also grown men who cry, embrace and expose their vulnerabilities and failings even as a culture of toxic masculinity thrives on- and offline. It strengthens their messages of strength, love, hope and acceptance beyond what boybands have offered before.K-pop idols work intensively, in a world where a few careers will last more than 10 years, but many are over in just 12 months. This year BTS have released three albums (two Korean and one Japanese), toured the world and produced a third series of their travel reality show, Bon Voyage. Their schedule is planned down to the minute. “I think there were times we were pretty close to burning out,” admits Suga, “but it’s inevitable and it’s the same for people in any profession.”Current and former idols have shifted towards acting, appearing on South Korea’s variety TV shows, and explored solo careers. Suga’s interests include architecture and lighting. Jungkook, the youngest member at 21, has taken up documentary-style film-making, his most recent short capturing the extremes of his life – the intensity of the stage and the stillness of the aftermath. He says he feels “a lot of happiness when I think about things I can do in the future”. He has energy to burn – he will later give himself a minor heel injury before the first London show and spend it confined to a stool, tearfully apologising for not fully participating.During a recent live session on streaming platform VLive, V, whose slightly hoarse voice gives the group a soulful edge, played snippets of solo work to much buzz. BTS’s rappers have already released self-written and produced solo mixtapes, but the vocalists have yet to follow in their footsteps. “I’m working on it,” offers Jungkook, when J-hope begins laughing.RM weighs in, amused, “He’s getting ready for too many things! Films, boxing – he’s planning so much that no one knows when it’s coming out.”A good-natured squabble breaks out. “When J-hope gives me the beats, maybe I can get started on my tape,” deadpans Jin, the oldest member at 25.J-hope feigns indignation. “I gave him beats! He liked what I gave him!” he says as Jin cackles at the ceiling.“On all the songs I make,” V chips in, having sat back for most of the interview, “I feel there’s something that’s just not there. I have a shortcoming, I can’t finish a song, I need someone to help me. When I come up with something I can put out, I will.”Suga jabs back. “It’s going to be about 20 years then.”For their fans it’s this kind of playful teasing and natural camaraderie that makes BTS so appealing. For the band, their connection helps support their frenetic work pace.Openly ambitious, Suga has repeatedly stated that a Grammy win is his next goal and recently added playing the Super Bowl halftime show (71,000 people in the arena 120m watching at home) to the list. Either could be the thing that cements BTS’s status as household names. Right now, neither seems unreachable. “We want to show as much as we can,” says Jimin, his gaze unwavering. “We only want to be able to show our best.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e9fa2a25d9e1e446c75bb2a62b5ef3508e4fc8/1090_810_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a10dbcb5653d43d7621022f234df5676","title":"could populism actually be good for democracy","story":"A wave of populist revolts has led many to lose faith in the wisdom of people power. But such eruptions are essential to the vitality of modern politics. By  James MillerEveryone seems to agree that democracy is under attack. What is surprising is how many of its usual friends have come to fear democracy itself – or perhaps to fear that a country’s people, too inflamed by narrow passions, risk turning politics into a distasteful blood sport, pitting The People vs Democracy, in the startling words of one recent book title.Observers have understandable qualms about political programmes that are alarmingly illiberal, yet obviously democratic, in that most citizens support them. In Poland and Hungary, democratically elected ruling parties attack Muslim migrants for undermining Christian identity. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte rules with an iron fist, pledging to put drug pushers in funeral parlours, not prisons.Modern democracies all rest on a claim of popular sovereignty – the proposition that all legitimate governments grow out of the power of a people, and in some way are subject to its will. Yet when a large majority of a country’s people vehemently supports policies a critic finds abhorrent, many liberals, even avowed democrats, recoil in horror.Thus arises the possibility of a painful paradox: that “democracies end when they are too democratic”. So concluded a 2016 piece by the US political observer Andrew Sullivan, resurrecting an argument made two generations earlier by Samuel Huntington (in a 1975 report called The Crisis of Democracy, issued in the wake of the international student revolts of the 1960s).Even the leftwing scholar Chantal Mouffe, who has long championed raw populist conflict as the essence of “radical democracy”, seems distraught at current events. “Democracy that is in good working order – with conflict, but where people accept the existence of their adversaries – is not easy to re-establish,” she recently told an interviewer, gesturing implicitly toward tolerance, one of the most jeopardised liberal norms in the current context: “I’m not that optimistic.”Current affairs may seem especially bleak, but fears about democracy are nothing new. At the zenith of direct democracy in ancient Athens, in the fifth century BC, one critic called it a “patent absurdity” – and so it seemed to most political experts from Aristotle to Edmund Burke, who considered democracy “the most shameless thing in the world”. As the American founding father John Adams warned, “there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide”.For almost 2,000 years, most western political theorists agreed with Aristotle, Burke and Adams: nobody could imagine seriously advocating democracy as an ideal form of government. It was only at the end of the 18th century that democracy reappeared as a modern political ideal, during the French Revolution.Ever since, popular insurrections and revolts in the name of democracy have become a recurrent feature of global politics. It needs to be stressed: these revolts are not an unfortunate blemish on the peaceful forward march toward a more just society they form the heart and soul of modern democracy as a living reality.It is a familiar story: out of the blue, it seems, a crowd pours into a city square or gathers at a barnstorming rally held by a spellbinding orator, to protest against hated institutions, to express rage at the betrayals of the ruling class, to seize control of public spaces. To label these frequently disquieting moments of collective freedom “populist”, in a pejorative sense, is to misunderstand a constitutive feature of the modern democratic project.Yet these episodes of collective self-assertion are invariably fleeting, and often provoke a political backlash in turn. The political disorder they create stands in tension with the need for a more stable, peaceful form of collective participation. That is one reason why many modern democrats have tried to create representative institutions that can – through liberal protections for the freedom of religion, and of the press, and the civil rights of minorities – both express, and tame, the will of a sovereign people.Thus the great French philosopher Condorcet in 1793 proposed creating a new, indirect form of self-rule, linking local assemblies to a national government. “By ingrafting representation upon democracy,” as Condorcet’s friend Tom Paine put it, the people could exercise their power both directly, in local assemblies, and indirectly, by provisionally entrusting some of their powers to elected representatives.Under the pressure of events, another ardent French democrat, Robespierre, went further and defended the need, amid a civil war, for a temporary dictatorship – precisely to preserve the possibility of building a more enduring form of representative democracy, once its enemies had been defeated and law and order could be restored.But there was a problem with these efforts to establish a modern democracy at scale. Especially in a large nation such as France or the US, representative institutions – and, even worse, dictatorial regimes claiming a popular mandate – inevitably risk frustrating anyone hoping to play a more direct role in political decision-making.This means that the democratic project, both ancient and modern, is inherently unstable. The modern promise of popular sovereignty, repeatedly frustrated, produces recurrent efforts at asserting the collective power of a people. If observers like the apparent result of such an effort, they may hail it as a renaissance of the democratic spirit if they do not, they are liable to dismiss these episodes of collective self-assertion as mob rule, or populism run amok.No matter. Even though the post-second world war consensus over the meaning and value of liberal democratic institutions seems more fragile than ever – polls show that trust in elected representatives has rarely been lower – democracy as furious dissent flourishes, in vivid and vehement outbursts of anger at remote elites and shadowy enemies.It is important to sharply distinguish democracy from liberalism – two value-laden words that, in recent years, have become almost hopelessly conflated and confused, especially in the work of social scientists and western political pundits who fret that western liberal democracy, once the “promised land”, has become “the enemy” in places like Hungary.Unlike democracy, “liberalism” is a relatively late addition to our political lexicon. In Europe, the word first came into wide usage in the 19th century by various political theorists and statesmen in France, Germany and Italy, united in their horror at the bloodshed of the French Revolution, but otherwise varied in their positive views.Modern democracy also has no necessary connection to liberalism. The Protestant champions of popular sovereignty in the 16th century summoned it for the express purpose of dethroning rulers with whose religious views they disagreed: “It was not religious liberty they sought, but the elimination of wrong religions,” as the historian Edmund Morgan wrote in 1988.What is clear today is that while democracy may be widely admired, it is, in its liberal form, an embattled ideology. As the social scientist William Galston has sharply observed: “Few leaders and movements in the west dare to challenge the idea of democracy itself. Not so for liberalism, which has come under mounting attack.” One result has been the rise of popular movements in which a majority of ordinary citizens has embraced a narrow conception of solidarity and rallied around a leader who claims to embody the will of such a closed community.Another result has been a resurgence of traditional anxieties, notably in the UK and the US, about democracy and its obvious dangers. After all, why should we entrust the fate of the Earth to large numbers of ordinary citizens foolish enough to support self-destructive policies and manifestly unfit leaders?Most ancient authorities reviled democracy in Athens. Plato, perhaps the most widely admired writer in antiquity, and someone who lived under democratic rule in the fourth century, criticised the false beliefs that prevailed in a city governed by public opinion rather than true knowledge, and he deplored the “insolence, anarchy, wastefulness, and shamelessness” that those false beliefs facilitated. The historian Thucydides, another citizen of democratic Athens, who chronicled the Peloponnesian War with Sparta that ended with the defeat of Athens in 404, essentially blamed the power of the ordinary people of Athens, and their susceptibility to manipulation by mendacious orators, for this catastrophic outcome.Thanks to such critiques – as well as subsequent political developments, from the Macedonian empire of Alexander the Great to modern European monarchies claiming a ine right to rule – for a long time nobody much cared about the Athenian political system, or about democracy as a form of government.The Athenian democracy certainly doesn’t measure up by modern liberal standards: at its zenith in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, it did not choose most of its government by holding elections nor did it protect the human rights of its citizens, as it lacked any notion of such rights nor were the fundamental powers of the Athenian polis enshrined in a comprehensive written document.What Athens did have is a community in which every citizen was expected to participate in the political life of the city – and far more actively than in any modern democracy. At the height of democracy in Athens, an assembly of citizens, open to all, met at least 40 times a year. All political offices were held by ordinary citizens, randomly selected, and all legal judgments in the city’s courts were reached by large juries of ordinary citizens, similarly selected. And all this happened in a comparatively large commercial city that dominated the eastern Mediterranean world for nearly two centuries.These institutions were the result of a popular uprising in 508BC, against Spartan troops who had seized the Acropolis. Instead of acquiescing in a foreign occupation, the ordinary citizens of Athens spontaneously converged on the Acropolis and surrounded the Spartan army. It took only three days to drive the Spartans from the city – which suggests the popular uprising had numbers and force on its side.The result was a sweeping transformation of Athenian institutions and the subsequent appearance, for the first time in history, of “democracy”, as a word to describe a regime where power (kratos) was in the hands of ordinary people (demos). Henceforth all legislation in Athens had to be validated in the assembly, which was now open to all citizens, no matter how poor. Even more important was the use of a lottery to staff most city offices and juries, which nullified the corrupting advantages conferred in elections by wealth and family prominence.By empowering an impoverished multitude in this manner, critics charged, the assembly and democratic orators had in fact created a new kind of tyranny – a collective tyranny of the majority, a de facto welfare state that doled out money and patronage to the ordinary citizens who manned the imperial fleet and staffed the city’s courts and offices.For Plato, the key problem was epistemological: most people – “the many” – had no knowledge of truth and no clear pattern of justice in their minds. Democracy corrupted even intelligent citizens by leading them to dumb down their policies in order to pander to ignorant crowds. When they gathered “in assemblies, courts, theatres, army camps, or any other common meeting of a multitude,” the Athenian demos, Plato reports, would “blame some of the things said or done, and praise others, both in excess, shouting and clapping and besides, the rocks and the very place surrounding them echo and redouble the uproar of praise and blame.”After the eclipse of direct self-rule in the ancient world, the idea of democracy survived, barely. In the west, it was mainly used as a term of art, deployed by legal scholars, generally in two contradictory usages. On the one hand, democracy became a virtual synonym for violent anarchy: the Roman historian Polybius said “the license and lawlessness” of democracy inevitably “produces mob rule”, to complete a cycle through which all governments had to pass, going from best (monarchy) to worst (democracy, and then mob rule).On the other hand, Polybius also argued that democracy had a potentially constructive role to play. He suggested that the most durable political regime would be a republic that combined the three pure forms of government (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy) into interlinked branches that would check and balance each other, enabling a well-ordered republic to navigate the winds of time “like a well-trimmed boat”.In the centuries that followed, a tradition of republican thought emerged, based on the example of ancient Rome. During the Renaissance, some theorists working within the republican tradition cautiously suggested that ordinary people might have an especially useful role to play, especially as watchdogs and soldiers. Because they were jealous of their freedom, they would be vigilant spectators of executive and administrative conduct, on guard against malfeasance. The very passions of the people, which could generate a certain esprit de corps, could also be harnessed for the enhancement of a republic’s military might. Machiavelli, dreaming of a resurgence of Italian glory in the Renaissance, was eager to exploit popular ardour: “The best armies are those of armed peoples,” rather than paid mercenaries.At the same time, republican writers tended to agree that the chief danger to a mixed constitution came from the democratic element, because of its tendency to degenerate into violence and anarchy. Machiavelli warned that the people, left to their own devices, were “promoters of license”. Algernon Sidney, an English republican beheaded for expressing treasonous views in 1683, denied being a proponent of pure democracy. So did the Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu, who pointedly worried about the “spirit of extreme equality” he assumed was typical of democracies. Even in the US, in the wake of a war against colonial rule by a distant monarch and amid expansive new assertions of the power of the people, political theorists handled the idea of democracy gingerly, if they acknowledged it at all.In this context, the political writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau came as a shock. The key was the audacious way he redefined sovereignty in terms of democracy. Before Rousseau, “sovereignty” had implied brute force, empire and the ability to command. After him, it defined not the dominion of monarchs, but the legitimate power of a people. In the wake of the French Revolution, he came to be seen as a prophet, for writings such as this, from Emile, first published in 1763: “The great become small, the rich become poor, the monarch becomes subject are the blows of fate so rare that you can count on being exempted from them? We are approaching the state of crisis and the century of revolutions.”By the summer of 1792, militants inspired by Rousseau were arguing that political power, properly understood, belonged neither to a king, nor to a distant body of elected representatives, but rather to the people assembled in their local neighbourhoods, where they could discuss their shared fate face to face. Events came to a head on 10 August 1792, when a majority of these local assemblies resolved that only an armed revolt would assure that the French people were truly sovereign. At midnight, they seized the town hall in the morning they assaulted the king’s quarters at the Tuileries Palace, although by then he and his family had fled for their lives.The most radically democratic phase of the French Revolution thus began with a carnival of atrocities. But the violence cracked open a new world of political possibilities. For the first time since ancient Athens, direct democracy had become a concrete, collective goal – at least in the minds of the Parisian commoners streaming through the streets with their muskets and pikes.This uprising led to the dissolution of the French National Assembly, the convening of a constitutional convention and the public execution of the king after a show trial. The convention enabled Condorcet to draft the world’s first democratic constitution. But it was never implemented – a Jacobin coup forced Condorcet into hiding, and led to a reign of terror, which the Jacobin leader, Robespierre, argued was necessary to defend the nascent democracy from its many foes, both foreign and French.In the autumn of 1793, the new republic’s conscripts, on orders from Paris, embarked on a murderous rampage in the Vendée that killed some 250,000 people, most of them innocent men, women and children. The French Revolution had resurrected the idea of democracy – and produced a hecatomb on a grand scale.“Of this I am certain,” Burke declared, “that in a democracy, the majority of the citizens is capable of exercising the most cruel oppressions upon the minority.” In the aftermath of the French Revolution, his fears were widely shared by conservatives and self-described “liberals”.Fearful of armed crowds and the possibility of mob rule, the American constitution had been explicitly designed to empower not ordinary citizens, but a “natural aristocracy”. As Benjamin Rush, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, explained: “All power is derived from the people” – but this power is not wielded by the people: “They possess it only on the days of their elections. After this, it is property of their rulers, nor can they exercise or resume it, unless it is abused.”To this day, the US remains a deeply flawed democracy. It still has an electoral college designed to thwart majorities. It still has a senate that guarantees inequality of political representation. It still is the scene of pitched struggles over the right to vote.Yet, this primordial American prejudice against democracy was almost instantly transformed by an equally passionate upwelling of American enthusiasm for democracy, in the wake of the French Revolution. Among the enthusiasts was Thomas Jefferson, who, in 1800, brought his Democratic-Republican party to power, and in this way also brought democracy – at least as a word – into the American lexicon.A generation later, Andrew Jackson, the first great American democratic leader – or, demagogue, to use the ancient Greek term of art for such a leader – became the US’s first plebiscitary president, imbued with imperial prerogatives in the eyes of his most ardent supporters. He was, after all, the only representative nominally elected by all the nation’s people (unless, of course, they were women, slaves or Native Americans – democracy in America in Jackson’s day was only the white man’s business).Jackson tried, and failed, to eliminate the electoral college. Such enduring limits to democracy in the US were, paradoxically, one reason why it was the first country to give birth to populism, both as a word and as a phenomenon. From 1892 till 1896, a People’s Party played a major political role in some parts of the US.At roughly the same time, Woodrow Wilson, arguably the country’s most ardent champion of democracy, criticised the populist movement and offered, instead, a new vision of the democratic system. A pioneering political scientist who would become the 28th president, Wilson pondered deeply the meaning of democracy, not just in the US, but in world history, where it marked in his view the highest stage of human evolution. In his private papers, after rejecting European conceptions of democracy as primitive, and corrupted by class conflict, he defined modern democracy “most briefly” as “government by popular opinion”.As Wilson concedes almost in passing, democracy in practice will always involve “the many led by the few: the minds of the few disciplined by persuading, and masses of men schooled and directed by being persuaded”. In other words, Wilson’s vision of self-rule is closer to Adams’s “natural aristocracy” than the popular sovereignty the French revolutionaries and American populists fought for.We find here a core ambiguity at the heart of modern liberal democracy, as Wilson understood it. All power in theory derives from the people – but in practice, the truest vessel of a people’s hopes will be its highest elected official when he enjoys the support of “public opinion”.There were, nonetheless, serious problems with Wilson’s recourse to public opinion. Views could rapidly change, and even an orator as persuasive as Wilson could not be sure if he had persuaded his fellows once and for all. Even worse – as Walter Lippmann pointed out in his landmark 1922 study, Public Opinion – in a complex political environment, where only disconnected bits of information are available to the average citizen, it was almost impossible in practice for the public’s opinion on any matter of moment to be either cogent or coherent.Lippman used for his epigraph Plato’s famous image of the inhabitants of a cave bewitched by shadows and unaware of the real world outside. The majority of modern men, Lippmann argues, are prisoners of shadowy and unexamined assumptions, immersed in private lives involving the pursuit of personal interests, with limited time and even less attention to give to public affairs.Lippmann’s conclusion is most bluntly stated in The Phantom Public: “The inidual man does not have opinions on all public affairs. He does not know how to direct public affairs. He does not know what is happening, why it is happening, what ought to happen. I cannot imagine how he could know, and there is not the least reason for thinking, as mystical democrats have thought, that the compounding of inidual ignorances in masses of people can produce a continuous directing force in public affairs.”In 1942, Joseph Schumpeter, an economist who had been born in Moravia and raised in Vienna before moving to the US in 1932 to teach at Harvard University, accurately summed up the strange results of merging a liberal democratic faith in public opinion with marketing methods refined by behavioural scientists. “What we are confronted with in the analysis of political processes,” he wrote, “is largely not a genuine but a manufactured will.”In his day, the primary tools for the manipulation of opinion were advertising and propaganda tailored to the results of public opinion polling. In our day, the integrity of public opinion is further threatened by the secrecy of many aspects of executive decision-making, and the increasingly sophisticated control of information by behavioural scientists and attention merchants, who are able to use new technologies to aim messages with unprecedented precision at responsive audiences.Schumpeter argued that the primary role of the people in a liberal democracy was in any case strictly limited: it was “to produce a government, or else an intermediate body which in turn will produce a national executive or government … the democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which iniduals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people’s vote.”In other words, modern democracy was not the rule of a sovereign people – instead, “democracy is the rule of the politician”, someone skilled at commanding public opinion and winning elections, whose power is chiefly balanced by his need for reelection, and the requirement that he leave office peacefully, should he lose the vote.Schumpeter was writing during the second world war, which had led to the total mobilisation of the civilian population in all combatant states. Worldwide, this unprecedented mobilisation led to the unprecedented slaughter of 60 million souls, the majority of them civilians, and six million of them Jews. In the US, it entailed a dramatic increase in the powers of the administrative state and of the state’s armed forces it also triggered a rise in the perceived need to keep key political deliberations and decisions concealed from the public.Faced with such facts, no wonder Schumpeter was pessimistic about future political prospects, fearing that a “socialist democracy may eventually turn out to be more of a sham than capitalist democracy ever was”.And yet, as the second world war unfolded, just as had happened during the first world war, there was a paradoxical resurgence of democratic idealism, inspired by renewed Allied claims that their victory would help forge a world “made safe for democracy”, just as Wilson had promised two generations earlier.After the horrors of two world wars, many hoped humanity would never again resort to violence on this industrial scale. After some hesitation, and with compromising caveats similar to those that undermined the League of Nations covenant – above all, a continuing effort to protect the imperial and racial prerogatives of the great powers – the victors agreed to create a new international organisation, the United Nations, and to ratify a new set of global principles, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948.It is easy to minimise the importance of a political document issued with no means of enforcing the norms it proclaimed. Yet the language of the declaration helped to inspire later human rights movements, and article 21 explicitly affirms that “everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives”.Here is a key irony of the modern world: to this day, democracy, in most existing regimes, whether liberal or socialist or nationalist, is more or less a sham, even according to the criteria laid out in the UDHR, and just as Schumpeter said.Still, this “sham” also represents an epochal transformation: in the early 21st century, very few regimes, unlike most in the early 18th century, can rule over a subject population with impunity. On the contrary: the rulers of every contemporary regime that professes democratic values, however feebly realised, must periodically face the mundane threat posed by ordinary citizens, however uninformed, periodically queuing at a polling station, to exercise their right to vote, and so to transfer power, if they choose, to an entirely new set of political leaders.This is, as the Cambridge historian John Dunn puts it in the dyspeptic but accurate conclusion to his 2005 history of democracy, “a world in which faith, deference and even loyalty have largely passed away, and the keenest of personal admiration seldom lasts for long” – a wan description of what the modern democratic spirit has wrought.Yet this is also a world where the ideal of democracy is more universally honoured than ever before, and sometimes taken quite seriously, for better or worse.For example, in the decades since the ratification of the UDHR in 1948, most US presidents and diplomats have followed in Wilson’s footsteps by promoting liberal democratic expectations around the world – sometimes at gunpoint – just as communist regimes were trying at the same time to export their rival version of “democratic centralism”.So it is perhaps not surprising that our world has also witnessed, in virtually every country, poor or developed, socialist or communist, autocratic or liberal, a fitful, sometimes futile series of popular uprisings and protests, when crowds of ordinary people unite to demand a fairer share of the common wealth – and to claim for themselves a larger share in more truly democratic institutions. These revolts against remote elites are essential to the vitality, and viability, of modern democracy – even as (and precisely because) they challenge the status quo, destructive though that challenge may be.There are good reasons to be wary of what a people trying to exercise its sovereign rights may produce. Democratic revolts can create perverse results – and so can democratic elections. Despite the obvious risks, both Rousseau and Jefferson invoked a relevant maxim in defence of their own faith in ordinary citizens: Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem – “I prefer a dangerous freedom to peaceful slavery.” It’s an apt motto for these dark times.Adapted from Can Democracy Work?

Grayling said he was confident that the contingency measure would not be needed after Brexit.The Department for Transport is developing plans under the codename Operation Brock to handle queues of thousands of trucks, should freight be unable to progress swiftly through the ports when the UK leaves the European Union – possibly from March next year.Work has already started on the M20 motorway, with further closures ahead, where the Department for Transport has earmarked a 13.5-mile stretch between Maidstone and Ashford as a holding park for thousands of trucks. The four-lane southbound carriageway will be closed while a two-lane contraflow will allow traffic to continue to the Channel.Now it has been revealed that ministers are also planning to use the M26, a 10-mile motorway that links the M25 to the M20 in Kent, and starts some 65 miles back from Dover, to park more lorries.Highways England said: “As part of wider resilience planning, Highways England has been asked by the Department for Transport to develop plans to utilise the M26 to hold heavy goods vehicles, should further capacity be required in the future.“We will be undertaking site surveys on the M26 during October leading to the installation of two gates in the central reservation to support the safe management of freight in the future, if needed.”Although Highways England would not comment further on the detail of plans, the gates suggest a contraflow system and car park would also be operated on the Kent motorway.Drivers will be erted around the M25 and M20 between 10pm and 5am, doubling the length of journeys.The news emerged as the furious local MP told the Commons that Grayling and Highways England had assured him and constituents that no works were planned, up until Wednesday when the closures started.Tugendhat, MP for Tonbridge and Malling, said: “It’s come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or indeed with surrounding members.He called on the transport secretary to explain how planning permission was granted with “no consultation”. Locals believe the sudden closure could see much motorway traffic choose to drive on the parallel single-lane road through small villages in Kent rather than the official ersion.Grayling asked to meet Tugendhat to discuss the issue, adding: “I do not expect any of the contingencies that we have in place for a no-deal Brexit to be needed, because I’m confident we will reach a sensible agreement.”In 2015, disruption at Calais led to queues of lorries in Kent that were handled under Operation Stack, and the DfT has been searching for better ways to deal with stranded freight vehicles after roads were brought to a standstill. It has paid millions of pounds to the owners of the abandoned Manston airport in Kent as an emergency standby lorry park. While Operation Brock is still being drawn up as an interim plan, local council plans have shown that a planned, dedicated lorry park is likely to be at least four years away.Around 4m lorries cross the Channel between Dover and Calais each year and hauliers warn the slightest delays will result in huge queues. Rod McKenzie, the director of policy at the Road Haulage Association, said: “It’s important that the government make contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit but the concern is that this may be too little, too late – and it may have an impact on the rest of the supply chain in the Kent area, quite apart from the total chaos at the Channel Tunnel and Dover.“We’re worried that if there is no deal by November, drivers are going to need permits, and make safety and customs declarations, which is disastrous. The government are finally getting their heads around the scale of it.”But, he added: “Turning motorways into car parks frankly doesn’t really help. It’s more congestion and more pollution, which we’re all trying to cut down on – it’s not good news in any shape or form.”He warned lorry parks would not solve the problem of just-in-time deliveries and perishable goods, while they could spell appalling conditions for drivers: “Imagine spending 15 hours parked up on a motorway with no lavatory or wash facilities – the mind boggles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1accb532328b8c9d791bf2c380e5a30b8bd747dd/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70a633b8cdcbd288150099bbad9c33c4","title":"black holes and soft hair why stephen hawkings final work is important","story":"Malcolm Perry, who worked with Hawking on his final paper, explains how it improves our understanding of one of universe’s enduring mysteriesThe information paradox is perhaps the most puzzling problem in fundamental theoretical physics today. It was discovered by Stephen Hawking 43 years ago, and until recently has puzzled many.Starting in 2015, Stephen, Andrew Strominger and I started to wonder if we could understand a way out of this difficulty by questioning the basic assumptions that underlie the difficulties. We published our first paper on the subject in 2016 and have been working hard on this problem ever since.The most recent work, and perhaps the last paper that Stephen was involved in, has just come out. While we have not solved the information paradox, we hope that we have paved the way, and we are continuing our intensive work in this area.Physics is really about being able to predict the future given how things are now. For example, if you throw a ball, once you know its initial position and velocity, then you can figure out where it will be in the future. That kind of reasoning is fine for what we call classical physics but for small things, like atoms and electrons, the rules need some modifications, as described by quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, instead of describing precise outcomes, one finds that one can only calculate the probabilities for various things to happen. In the case of a ball being thrown, one would not know its precise trajectory, but only the probability that it would be in some particular place given its initial conditions.What Hawking discovered was that in black hole physics, there seemed to be even greater uncertainty than in quantum mechanics. However, this kind of uncertainty seemed to be completely unacceptable in that it resulted in many of the laws of physics appearing to break down. It would deprive us of the ability to predict anything about the future of a black hole.That might not have mattered – except that black holes are real physical objects. There are huge black holes at the centres of many galaxies. We know this because observations of the centre of our galaxy show that there is a compact object with a mass of a few million times that of our sun there such a huge concentration of mass could only be a black hole. Quasars, extremely luminous objects at the centres of very distant galaxies, are powered by matter falling onto black holes. The observatory Ligo has recently discovered ripples in spacetime, gravitational waves, produced by the collision of black holes.The root of the problem is that it was once thought that black holes were completely described by their mass and their spin. If you threw something into a black hole, once it was inside you would be unable to tell what it was that was thrown in.These ideas were encapsulated in the phrase “a black hole has no hair”. We can often tell people apart by looking their hair, but black holes seemed to be completely bald. Back in 1974, Stephen discovered that black holes, rather than being perfect absorbers, behave more like what we call “black bodies”. A black body is characterised by a temperature, and all bodies with a temperature produce thermal radiation.If you go to a doctor, it is quite likely your temperature will be measured by having a device pointed at you. This is an infrared sensor and it measures your temperature by detecting the thermal radiation you produce. A piece of metal heated up in a fire will glow because it produces thermal radiation.Black holes are no different. They have a temperature and produce thermal radiation. The formula for this temperature, universally known as the Hawking temperature, is inscribed on the memorial to Stephen’s life in Westminster Abbey. Any object that has a temperature also has an entropy. The entropy is a measure of how many different ways an object could be made from its microscopic ingredients and still look the same. So, for a particular piece of red hot metal, it would be the number of ways the atoms that make it up could be arranged so as to look like the lump of metal you were observing. Stephen’s formula for the temperature of a black hole allowed him to find the entropy of a black hole.The problem then was: how did this entropy arise? Since all black holes appear to be the same, the origin of the entropy was at the centre of the information paradox.What we have done recently is to discover a gap in the mathematics that led to the idea that black holes are totally bald. In 2016, Stephen, Andy and I found that black holes have an infinite collection of what we call “soft hair”. This discovery allows us to question the idea that black holes lead to a breakdown in the laws of physics.Stephen kept working with us up to the end of his life, and we have now published a paper that describes our current thoughts on the matter. In this paper, we describe a way of calculating the entropy of black holes. The entropy is basically a quantitative measure of what one knows about a black hole apart from its mass or spin.While this is not a resolution of the information paradox, we believe it provides some considerable insight into it. Further work is needed but we feel greatly encouraged to continue our research in this area. The information paradox is intimately tied up with our quest to find a theory of gravity that is compatible with quantum mechanics.Einstein’s general theory of relativity is extremely successful at describing spacetime and gravitation on large scales, but to see how the world works on small scales requires quantum theory. There are spectacularly successful theories of the non-gravitational forces of nature as explained by the “standard model” of particle physics. Such theories have been exhaustively tested and the recent discovery of the Higgs particle at Cern by the Large Hadron Collider is a marvellous confirmation of these ideas.Yet the incorporation of gravitation into this picture is still something that eludes us. As well as his work on black holes, Stephen was pursuing ideas that he hoped would lead to a unification of gravitation with the other forces of nature in a way that would unite Einstein’s ideas with those of quantum theory. Our work on black holes does indeed shed light on this other puzzle. Sadly, Stephen is no longer with us to share our excitement about the possibility of resolving these issues, which have now been around for half a century.• Malcolm Perry is professor of theoretical physics at the University of Cambridge, and a co-author of the new black hole research.A  Live event celebrating the work of Stephen Hawking, with Jim Al-Khalili, Maggie Aderin-Pocock and others, will take place on Monday 15 October at the Royal Institution in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d842f6e63ca80a283cf44a7126172e84b3d441d1/0_200_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66a146224325fe3fbe78dcbf990edb18","title":"record number of 10 and 11 year olds severely obese","story":"Official data puts one in 25 children in year 6 in England in highest category of being overweightA record number of 10- and 11-year-olds in England are classed as “severely obese”, official figures show.One in 25 children in year 6 of primary school are now so dangerously overweight that they are in that category, according to the latest annual findings of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP).Children classed as severely obese have a body mass index on or above the 99.6th percentile for their age and gender. The proportion of year 6 pupils in that category has risen by more than a third since 2006-07.The figures, based on weighing and measuring more than a million schoolchildren, are the definitive measure of children’s weight in England.Children’s doctors said the figures were “totally unacceptable”, adding that more children and families should be able to attend weight management sessions.Dr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, praised ministers for setting out plans to tackle childhood obesity – for example, by banning junk food advertisements on television before the 9pm watershed.Public Health England, which oversees the NCMP, warned that children who were too heavy were at greater risk of suffering from poor self-esteem, bullying and stigma when they were young. They also stood a much greater chance of becoming adults who were overweight or obese, which increases the risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.Steve Brine, the public health minister, said that reversing the very worrying trends in childhood obesity would take a long time.“Obesity is a problem that has been decades in the making – one that will take significant effort across government, schools, families and wider society to address. We cannot expect to see a reversal in trends overnight. But we have been clear that we are willing to do whatever it takes to keep children healthy and well in this country,” Brine said.He pointed to the fact that as a result of the tax on sugary drinks that began UK-wide in April sugar levels in many products had been cut and money from the levy was being used to fund school sport and breakfast clubs.Theresa May has pledged to halve childhood obesity by 2030, though medical and public health bodies and charities have said government plans did not go far enough and relied too much on food manufacturers voluntarily reducing sugar levels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddc25e8df48da7c54ff37beef2264260b25f3adf/0_88_4767_2860/master/4767.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8df55d0cc95bd33b1fd208df9c189ca1","title":"european champions cup 2018 19 pool by pool","story":"A pool featuring four former winners and 11 titles but it is hard to see anything other than Leinster topping it with ease. Indeed, few would bet against them claiming a fifth title in May and becoming Europe’s most successful side, having pulled level with Toulouse last season. Back-to-back fixtures against Bath will be intriguing now the club stalwart Girvan Dempsey looks after the West Country side’s attack but they, along with Wasps and Toulouse, appear to be scrapping for second place. Todd Blackadder has cited the Champions Cup as the reason his squad took such a hit last season so it may be that Bath do not prioritise the latter rounds if unlikely to qualify, whereas Toulouse have started the season brightly, with something of a return to their commitment to free-flowing rugby. Wasps have been hit by injuries in key positions at just the wrong time.Key player Tadhg Furlong (Leinster). Probably the best tighthead in the world. Mixes brute force with telling contributions in the loose and is a fine scrummager.Exeter, another year older and wiser, have the capacity to go deep in the competition. Rob Baxter has been thinking about the Chiefs’ opening fixture, at home to Munster, for a while and created the depth that has allowed him to rotate in the Premiership while still winning six from six. Their pack is monstrous and so clashes with Castres will not be for the faint-hearted. The Top 14 champions are likely to fare better than normal, mainly because they have previously shown little regard for the competition, but they are considerably hamstrung by Benjamín Urdapilleta’s absence. Munster have the knowhow to pip them to second place with Joey Carbery pulling the strings while Gloucester are unlikely to advance but will be better for the experience next season.Key player Conor Murray (Munster). Mystery continues to surround his neck injury – we do not even know how much of the competition he will play in – but he brings such a composure to Munster when available.Saracens appear to be the side best placed to challenge Leinster and should prove far too strong for their pool rivals. Glasgow can dazzle on their day – particularly if Adam Hastings can continue his fine form – but Saracens’ start to the season has been ominous. You worry for Cardiff Blues in their double-header against the English champions and Lyon have a scrum-half crisis. Carl Fearns and Liam Gill are back-rowers of considerable repute and you would not bet against the former producing his best against Saracens but, as debutants, it is hard to see the French side advancing. Perhaps Glasgow will, having got things badly wrong in Dave Rennie’s first season in charge – he is too good a coach to make the same mistakes. There will be plenty of tries in this pool, too, with three of the four sides playing their home matches on artificial pitches.Key player Billy Vunipola (Saracens). He made 28 carries in his first 80 minutes of the season last week to suggest he is slowly but surely finding his form of old. He is a way off yet but it would not be surprising if European action brings it out of him.Racing 92 are comfortably France’s best hope of success, having lost a nail-biting final to Leinster in May. They have the depth to go that far again and the new arrivals Finn Russell and Simon Zebo (dubbed facteur X et facteur Z by one French newspaper) have both made fine starts to life in Paris. Their opening fixture away to the Scarlets feels decisive as to whether they will top their pool and will be instructive as to whether the Welsh side have changed their approach, having been such a joy to watch last season until Leinster squeezed the life out of them. They have back-row problems with John Barclay departed and James Davies injured, while Tadhg Beirne, a revelation in this competition last season, has left for Munster. It is hard to see Leicester and Ulster advancing – both are former winners but are under new management and have fundamental issues to resolve.Key player Jonathan Davies (Scarlets). Hopefully his injury problems are behind him because he has the class to ensure the Scarlets’ success story of last season repeats itself.Perhaps the hardest pool to call. Newcastle did so well to qualify but after their difficult start to the season you wonder if they can afford not to prioritise the Premiership. Edinburgh are in a similar overachieving boat but Richard Cockerill’s teams are not known for rolling over. Toulon have started their season disastrously despite the arrivals of their illustrious signings Julian Savea and Liam Messam, with the owner, Mourad Boudjellal, seeking five new names to resolve his side’s problems. They do have a rich European history and perhaps the Champions Cup will bring the best out of the them but Montpellier will fancy their chances of advancing having been outgunned by Leinster and Exeter last season. Vern Cotter has considerable fly-half problems, though, with Aaron Cruden, Frans Steyn and Johan Goosen all injured.Key player Duhan van der Merwe (Edinburgh). He may not end up making it to the knockout stage but the hulking South African winger is one to keep an eye on. He struggled to make an impact at Montpellier but is shining in Scotland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/982b732b95ef27990b5f7877e214cdd63162c49a/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3790465ceed45715b8ce2aef99f8d05a","title":"energy difference cloud blockchain google docs decentralised web","story":"Martin is interested in using a DWeb alternative to Google Docs, but worries about the energy use associated with blockchainI recently read a piece about decentralisation. As I am looking for an alternative to Google, Microsoft and the other big names, Graphite stood out. However, it uses blockchain, and one thing that I do not find encouraging is the amount of energy it consumes.So my question is: from an energy point of view, is there much difference between cloud and blockchain?The electricity I use at home is from renewable sources. MartinThe main aim of the decentralised web (DWeb) is to remove the power of centralised “gatekeepers” such as Facebook and Google, who hoover up the world’s data and monetise it by selling advertising. It reminds me of the original concept of the web, where every computer would be both a client and a server, sharing information on a more or less equal basis.Of course, that is not how real life works. What actually happens is that you get a power law distribution with a few large entities and a long tail of small ones.As Clay Shirky wrote in 2003: “In systems where many people are free to choose between many options, a small subset of the whole will get a disproportionate amount of traffic (or attention, or income), even if no members of the system actively work towards such an outcome. This has nothing to do with moral weakness, selling out, or any other psychological explanation. The very act of choosing, spread widely enough and freely enough, creates a power law distribution.”The web still has plenty of variety, but almost everyone is familiar with one giant search engine, one giant retailer, one giant auction site, one giant social network, one giant encyclopaedia, and so on. Indeed, there is only one giant internet where there used to be dozens of competing networks using many different protocols.Obviously, it would be better if we all agreed these things in advance, based on open standards. However, people vote with their wallets, and competition results in de facto standards instead of de jure ones. Examples include Microsoft Windows, Google Search and Facebook. Each triumphed in a competitive marketplace.I am not saying this is the ideal solution, just that, in most cases, it’s inevitable.One of the problems with returning to a decentralised web is that the internet is no longer decentralised. It has been redesigned around giant server farms, high-speed pipes and content delivery networks. It looks increasingly like a broadband television network because that is what it actually does most of the time.Today’s web is being optimised for the delivery of Netflix movies, BBC programmes on iPlayer, Spotify music, live streams of every major sporting event, and so on. You can upload your own live streams but communications are asynchronous: your downloads are much faster, and much more reliable, than your uploads. It’s really easy to watch 1TB of movies but an exercise in frustration trying to upload a 1TB hard-drive backup.If you really want to save energy and internet resources, stop streaming stuff. Broadcast TV and radio can reach tens of millions of people, and adding another million adds relatively little in the way of extra power consumption. There is school of thought that it is better for the environment to use CDs or DVDs for albums or films you go back to again and again, or you could at least use digital files stored on your PC or smartphone.And rather than using Graphite to replace Google Docs or Microsoft Office, just use a word processor offline. If you run Windows, you already have a text editor (Notepad) and a simple word processor (WordPad), and there are plenty of free alternatives. That will reduce global energy use and increase your privacy.It’s really simple. If you don’t want Google to read your documents, don’t write your documents on Google’s computers. And if you don’t want cloud servers using energy, don’t use the cloud.Companies such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft and Google are covering the world with server farms to make information more easily available. That’s harder to do with real distributed systems because the thousands or millions of separate computers may be turned off or otherwise unavailable when you need the data they are storing. Worse, unless it’s replicated, you could lose data.It’s true that server farms consume an ever-growing amount of electricity, much of it used for cooling purposes. However, the cost is a powerful incentive for operators to use cheaper renewables, such as solar panels, and to reduce their power consumption in other ways. For example, Facebook has built a data centre in the north of Sweden where the air is freezing cold, while Microsoft is experimenting with underwater data centres that are easier to cool.Microsoft is also sponsoring tree planting in Ireland as part of its commitment to becoming carbon neutral.A properly decentralised web, based on tens of millions of small servers, would not have the same incentives to cut energy use, nor the same economies of scale. And in reality, I expect DWeb will use the same giant data centres as everybody else.Bitcoin is having a terrible impact on the world’s energy consumption, and may use almost as much as Austria (8.2GW) by the end of this year. This is despite bitcoin mining making the usual transition from widely distributed – anyone with a PC could do it – to specialised equipment in data centres. However, it’s irrelevant to Graphite and, I suspect, to the rest of DWeb.Thankfully, GraphiteDocs does not use the Bitcoin blockchain to store anything except your identity. This is the result of Graphite’s decision to use the Blockstack application development system. Apart from that, Graphite uses its own virtual blockchain.To get started, you use the Blockstack browser to register your name on the Bitcoin blockchain. Once you’ve done that, you can use Graphite and other Blockstack apps. There are 34 in the app store. (Gaia is Blockstack’s decentralised storage system.)Graphite itself has two obvious advantages. First, all your files are encrypted. Second, you can store them wherever you like. By default, Graphite uses Microsoft’s Azure cloud, but you can connect to Dropbox, Google Drive or some other service.Your files are encrypted so the storage provider can’t read them, and they can’t be censored.The distributed web is being promoted by people I admire, including web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the Internet Archive’s Brewster Kahle and Mozilla’s Mitchell Baker. It also has a valid reason to exist: people really should own and control their own data, not just labour as unpaid serfs for surveillance capitalism. However, most people follow the line of least resistance, so the web is not going to change overnight.Services like Graphite are worth considering if you need both encryption and the ability to share secure files online, though there are other ways to do this, such as Boxcryptor and Whisply. DWeb apps will need to become easier to use and mobile before they can reach a mass market.But I can’t see any savings in energy consumption compared with just using a cloud service.Have you got a question?

Is the ‘curse of Strictly’ more about moralistic BBC bashing?It all started with a snog. Since shots of Strictly Come Dancing contestant Seann Walsh’s drunken kiss with dance partner Katya Jones appeared on the front page of the Sun on Sunday, the story has been played out in the red-tops. Today, the pair have made front pages of the Sun, the Mirror and Daily Mail. Their crime? Not apologising enough for said snog when they appeared on the Strictly spin-off It Takes Two to apologise for their actions.It is not surprising the duo have been pilloried by the press. The popular press love stories about the relationship-ending “curse of Strictly”, whose victims include rugby player Ben Cohen (who left his wife and now has a child with his dance partner Kristina Rihanoff) Rachel Riley (who orced her husband after appearing on the show in 2013 and is now with her partner Pasha Kovalev) and actor Georgia May Foote (who separated from her boyfriend before going on to date her dance partner Giovanni Pernice).We do not know what went on in Walsh’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend, the actor Rebecca Humphries. She did, however, write an extraordinarily brave and articulate statement that she posted on Twitter (note: she did not sell her story to the press, despite being offered money for doing so). In it, she claimed that during their relationship he had “aggressively and repeatedly” called her “psycho, nuts, mental” about her suspicions over his fidelity. Walsh has not addressed these claims.Yet the current coverage is not centred on this. Instead, it is a show trial for a snog.The dedicated column inches for forensic analysis of yesterday’s TV appearance included a front-page splash in the Sun under the banner “cheats face the music”. Over two further pages inside, the paper ran a full transcript of the interview, next to which a dedicated body-language expert was called in to explain that Walsh was not sincere because he “rubbed his nose” which is a “cut-off gesture”. Elsewhere, unnamed friends of Jones were quoted as saying the “Strictly snogger” keeps her husband “under the thumb”.The Mirror, meanwhile, went with the front-page headline “sorry excuse” and an inside page featuring a paparazzi picture of Jones’s husband Neil out walking his dog. The Daily Mail went with “Cha-cha cheat’s weasel apology”.While the judges have said that the incident will not affect the pair’s scores on Saturday night, and that they will be judged solely on their Charleston, viewers are expected to deliver them a sequinned blow on Saturday night in the public vote.Why do the papers care so much about a kiss? Perhaps it is in part because licence-fee-payers often feel as if they own the BBC.But the reason is also because family show Strictly is the embodiment of the BBC’s commitment to “inform, educate and entertain”. The fact that Jones is a married woman also sparks moral outrage. If the papers see the BBC as gatekeepers of the nation’s moral values, then any transgression by its stars will be seen as public property. Even if, at the moment, all that is in the public domain is a quick snog in the dark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cc4cedc30aa69b2c829e89bab05eea1829b0741/0_303_2828_1697/master/2828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c10db16f0d9080964340f19d589f65ca","title":"panama city hurricane michael florida in pictures","story":"Hurricane Michael, the fiercest to hit Florida in 80 years, made landfall on Wednesday afternoon near Mexico Beach, about 20 miles south-east of Panama City in Florida Panhandle.

A mobile carport was picked up by the wind, crashed through the roof of the home where the girl was staying, and hit her in the head.The death is one of two reported so far from the storm. Another man was killed in Gadsden County, Florida when a falling tree crashed through the roof of his home.The two major hospitals in Panama City are evacuating their patients and shutting down due to heavy damage from Hurricane Michael, the Associated Press reported.Bay Medical Sacred Heart is transferring about 200 patients to other hospitals in Pensacola and Jacksonville, Florida, and Mobile, Alabama. Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center is also evacuating all patients.Sacred Heart’s statement says the transfers began at 3 a.m. Thursday with 39 critical care patients and would take about 48 hours to complete. The hospital sustained damage including blown out windows, a roof collapse in a maintenance and storage building, and a cracked wall. No patients were injured.Here’s an update from the ’s Oliver Milman:The ferocity of Hurricane Michael has caught even some storm observers a little by surprise. Within two days, Michael had turned from a tropical storm into a category four hurricane that was the strongest to hit the continental US since 1992.Hurricanes that intensify quickly are doing so far faster and stronger than they were 30 years ago, scientists have found. A sharp speed-up was present in each of the trio of major storms – Harvey, Irma and Maria – that caused widespread devastation in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico last year.A recent study by US researchers found that these sort of storms now feature average wind speeds that increase around 13mph more in a 24-hour period than they did 30 years ago.Much of this is down to a natural climate cycle known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which warms waters in the Atlantic. But as ocean waters worldwide heat up due to climate change, man-made influence is expected to play a larger and larger role.Experts now measure hurricanes by their wind speeds in categories 1 through 5, but meteorologists have begun to wonder about the potential for a category 6 hurricane as storms grow ever more powerful. Hurricane Michael was an “unbelievably destructive, powerful” storm, Donald Trump said at the White House.“We’ve not seen destruction like that in a long time,” Trump said at a bill signing.The hurricane was massively powerful but the silver lining was that it moved through fast. “It went through Florida very, very quickly. It didn’t linger,” Trump said.The president also defended his decision to hold a political rally in Pennsylvania Wednesday night instead of canceling it to manage storm response.“I couldn’t tell people that had been standing in line for a day and a half waiting to get into the arena that I’m not going,” Trump said. “I wasn’t going to disappoint thousands and thousands of people.”“We’re getting tremendous marks for the job that we did,” Trump said of the disaster response.’s Jamiles Lartey, who weathered the storm in Marianna, Florida, has re-established contact and will be filing a dispatch on the ground shortly.In Marianna, which is inland from the hardest-hit communities on the coast, social media posts showed widespread damage. A federal judge has rejected a push to extend Florida’s voter registration deadline because of Hurricane Michael, the Associated Press reported.US district judge Robert Hinkle ruled late Wednesday that there was “no justification” to extend the deadline, according to AP.The deadline was Tuesday. Florida secretary of state Ken Detzner told local election officials that if their offices were closed Tuesday for the storm, they could accept applications for a single day when they reopened.The Florida Democratic party sued in an effort to get the deadline extended by a week, but the judge declined to do so. The general election is Nov. 6.Florida’s panhandle and gulf coast woke up “unimaginable destruction,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott said.“So many lives have been changed forever. So many families have lost everything. Homes are gone. Businesses are gone,” Scott said at a briefing at the state Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. “Roads and infrastructure along the storm’s path have been destroyed. This hurricane was an absolute monster, and the damage left in its wake has yet to be fully understood.”Search and rescue teams have entered Panama City and Mexico Beach. The National Guard reached Mexico Beach Wednesday night and found 20 residents who had ridden out the storm there, and were uninjured, Scott said.The governor said he would join the National Guard to survey damage in Panama City and Mexico Beach Thursday. “I know what I’m going to see today is way worse than I would ever have imagined,” he said.Residents who evacuated for the storm were warned not to try to return on Thursday.“Do not try to travel home to a coastal community that was in the path of Hurricane Michael. It’s not safe,” Scott said. “Everyone needs to stay off the roads.”The Florida health department has 80 ambulance strike teams and 400 ambulances ready to assist with search and rescue.The state is distributing two million meals and one million gallons of drinking water.Power is out at 400,000 homes and businesses in Florida, Scott said. More than 19,000 people are working on power restoration.Michael is now bringing heavy rain and tropical storm-force winds over North and South Carolina, says the National Hurricane Center in its 11am update. The center of the storm is about 35 miles southeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. Sustained winds measure 50mph.The core of Michael will continue to move across central and eastern North Carolina today, move across southeastern Virginia this evening, and move into the Atlantic Ocean tonight, the center says.Michael is expected to drop 4 to 7 inches of rain in parts of North and South Carolina, with up to 9 inches in isolated spots in North Carolina and Virginia.Search and rescue crews have started making rescues of stranded people in the Florida Panhandle who rode out the storm.The US Coast Guard in Mobile, Alabama told the Associated Press its crews have rescued 27 people. A Jayhawk rescue helicopter crew pulled nine people from a bathroom of their Panama City home after their roof collapsed Wednesday afternoon, Petty Officer Third Class Ronald Hodges told the AP.Crews continue to search for more survivors. Mexico Beach is “gone” after taking a direct hit from Hurricane Michael, CNN’s Brooke Baldwin said as she surveyed the damage from a helicopter.Aerial footage showed whole swaths of homes complete demolished.“It’s gone. It’s gone,” Baldwin said. “It’s obliterated and it’s awful. It’s awful to look at.”“Home after home - what was a home - just flattened,” the correspondent added.Michael made landfall close to Mexico Beach with winds driving at 155 mph, a category 4 hurricane just shy of a category 5.Mexico Beach is home to about 1,200 people, and its mayor reported more than 200 had opted to stay and ride out the storm.The town measures about two miles by three miles and the wholesale devastation stretched as far as the eye could see, Baldwin reported.More than 830,000 homes across the affected area were without power Thursday morning, Reuters reported. At its height, the storm had knocked out power at 850,000 homes. Crews in Florida and Alabama had begun restoring some power after the worst of the storm blew through.The Florida Highway Patrol has closed 80 miles of Interstate 10, the main highway running through the Florida panhandle from east to west, to clear storm debris.Spokesman Eddie Elmore told the Associated Press the road was closed “due to extremely hazardous conditions.”The road is closed west of Tallahassee, and it’s not clear when it will reopen.Gov. Rick Scott urged Floridians Thursday morning to stay off the roads and keep them clear for emergency responders and utility crews.The tiny town of Mexico Beach, Florida took the brunt of Hurricane Michael, which made landfall nearby with winds at 155mph.Entire homes were destroyed by driving winds, while others were completely submerged by water.A reporter and photographer from the Tampa Bay Times reached the town of 1,200 early Thursday. They reported that fires were burning uncontrolled, with no one to put them out. Entire homes were gone, with only stairs left leading to houses that no longer exist.The town was nearly impassable, with the main highway covered with downed trees and debris. Refrigerators, toilets and staircases from destroyed home where scattered wherever they were dropped by the wind.Rex Putnal, a Mexico Beach City Council member, told CNN communications are down and city employees can’t even get into town to assess the damage.“I don’t have any sense of any casualties,” he said.Putnal said he has not returned to Mexico Beach, and advised residents not to until it is safe. His own home was built in the 1950s. “I’m not sure if it’s still there,” he told CNN.He added of Mexico Beach, “It is forever changed, probably.”’s Jamiles Lartey is in Marianna, Florida and has lost communications so far this morning. But he sent SMS messages late last night about what it was like as the eye and the eyewalls of the storm went by. At 11pm ET Wednesday, he wrote:“It passed right over me. We’re getting the rain bands coming through now. I can’t watch TV at all, no power at the hotel I’m in, but that doesn’t surprise me. But I’ve never experienced anything like this before.”Amid reports that people near the coast had barricaded themselves inside to stop the wind blowing down doors and walls, NBC’s Lester Holt and his crew were seen putting a mattress over the window of their hotel room. In a room above, which he said belonged to one of his producers, the window blew in, clearly with enough force to scatter shards of glass right across the room. There was no one in the room at the time.Lartey, 72 miles inland from Mexico Beach, where the direct hit was experienced, had duct tape with him to put over the windows but in the end did not need it. Last night just before 11PM he wrote: “Have heard five to six glass breaks in the last 90 minutes. The roof at the hotel across from me is shredded. The sign, too.”At times as the wind roared, Lartey had to retreat behind the bed in his hotel room for safety. His window held. “We’re past the hurricane force winds now,” he said, before his communications went out. With day breaking, we’ll bring you more news from Jamiles when we hear from him. The center of Michael is now moving over South Carolina, according to the latest update from the National Hurricane Center.Michael is now a tropical storm, driving sustained winds of 50mph.The storm is about 40 miles northwest of Columbia, South Carolina.While the storm weakened considerably since it tore through Florida as a category 4 hurricane, it is now hitting areas that were already reeling from Hurricane Florence.The center of Michael will continue to move across central South Carolina this morning, then move across portions of central and eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia this afternoon andthis evening, according to the Hurricane Center. After that, it’s expected to blow back out into the Atlantic Ocean.Parts of North Carolina’s outer banks, which were hard hit by Florence, could see storm surge of two to four feet from Michael. Tropical storm conditions are now occurring over portions of eastern and southeastern Georgia and South Carolina, and will spread northward across central and eastern portions of North Carolina today.After devastating the Florida Panhandle, Hurricane Michael headed for Georgia and the Carolinas late Wednesday. We’ll have more live updates today on its toll.A second death from the storm has been reported: An 11-year-old girl in Seminole County, Georgia died after a mobile carport was picked up by the wind, crashed through the roof of the home where she was staying, and hit her in the head, emergency management agency director Travis Brooks told WALB. It was 1:50 am Thursday by the time emergency crews were able to get to the girl, Brooks said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark one hundred years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world. Thirty nations had declared war between 1914 and 1918. Many countries along with Great Britain sided with the allies, including France, Italy, Russia, and the United States.

It says its website has nothing to do with denunciation. According to Bernd Baumann, a leading member of the AfD’s parliamentary group, it is a chance to address the considerable evidence the party said it had collected, showing that schools were often drawing “a very severe picture of the AfD as radical, inhuman and cold”.The party has encouraged pupils to look out for “cloddish AfD bashing”, including those wearing bags, badges or T-shirts bearing the slogan “FCK AfD”, as well as pointing out anything that might be recognisable as political indoctrination.Uwe Böken, a headteacher from Geilenkirchen, said he was denounced by the AfD after he invited the surviving member of a girls’ orchestra that was imprisoned in Auschwitz to talk to his school. Böken voiced his concerns during her visit that people with far-right views were sitting in the German parliament for the first time since the second world war.A disciplinary complaint was brought against Böken by the AfD. Even before it was ruled that Böken had not broken the neutrality code, he was denounced by party members across social media.“What’s happening with this portal is pure denunciation,” Böken told the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. Böken has taken his case up with the justice ministry. “You just have to look at a history book or also at the present day, to recognise this as something belonging to systems with a clear totalitarian character,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/847e2f55fce4f3d8ca2d0efe7d4c43c35ae411ce/0_241_5580_3349/master/5580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=298cfd126624000bf26847db93da4978","title":"jamal khashoggi case sponsors urged to pull out of key saudi event conference","story":"New York Times withdraws from ‘Davos in the Desert’ conference over missing journalistThe sponsors of a major Saudi investor event to be held in Riyadh later this month are facing calls to end their involvement in the conference after allegations of the kingdom’s connection to the disappearance and possible death of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.On Wednesday the New York Times pulled out as media sponsors of the conference, known by participants as “Davos in the Desert”, to be held at the same Ritz-Carlton hotel where crown prince Mohammed bin Salman last year jailed dozens of wealthy Saudis in what he said was an anti-corruption campaign.The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, will represent the Trump administration, while other prominent figures scheduled to take part are Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group, and Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber.Other media sponsors of the Future Investment Initiative, scheduled to take place 23-25 October, include the Financial Times, CNN, CNBC and Bloomberg. The Economist’s editor-in-chief, Zanny Minton Beddoes, is also due to speak.A range of consultants including Deloitte and McKinsey are also acting as conference partners.The New York Times’s decision to pull out was announced late on Wednesday by Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the paper. The Washington Post has challenged US media groups to explain whether they wished to be associated with a country accused of killing a prominent journalist. Many media firms responded to say they were monitoring their position.The Bahrain human rights group Bird said in a statement: “The New York Times pulled its sponsorship to the Riyadh conference. It’s time for business and the Financial Times to follow suit. An attack on one journalist should be considered an attack on all.”Bird has also called on the trustees of the Natural History Museum in London not to provide the museum as a venue for the Saudi Arabia annual national day celebration, organised by the Saudi embassy, and called for a protest outside the building. The museum said no member of staff would be speaking at the event and the decision was a commercial one that would gain valuable income for the museum.The pressure to pull out of the conference could grow in the days ahead if Saudi Arabia fails to provide convincing answers on Khashoggi’s disappearance.Turkey has accused Saudi Arabia of killing Khashoggi or transporting him against his will back to Saudi Arabia. Intelligence reports, largely sourced from the US, suggest Bin Salman had been seeking to lure Khashoggi back to Riyadh.The Saudi ambassador in London, Mohammed bin Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz, has so far declined invitations by the BBC to give an explanation on behalf of the Saudi government for Khashoggi’s disappearance since 2 October.Tony Blair, a supporter of the Saudi modernisation programme, said the Saudis needed to offer credible explanations for what had happened to Khashoggi. He described the situation as very serious.The Financial Times has taken a critical line on the Khashoggi affair, saying the crown prince needs to provide the world with answers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f821a91b13ecf519c2c0519240899cc2139267/3_0_4666_2800/master/4666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44b9de4db5e5891fa0260cb12d32db41","title":"kim wall swedish journalists to be made into tv series","story":"Tobias Lindholm, one of Borgen’s writers, announces The Investigation and vows her killer will not featureOne of the writers behind the Danish TV hit Borgen is to turn the murder of the Swedish journalist Kim Wall into a six-part TV series – but the killer, the self-taught rocket engineer Peter Madsen, will not feature.“I don’t want to make a crime series that is beguiled by the perpetrator or the crime,” said the director and screenwriter Tobias Lindholm in a press release announcing The Investigation. “It’s therefore a fully conscious decision that the perpetrator will at no time figure in the series.”Wall, 30, who wrote for the  and international publications such as the New York Times and Time magazine, disappeared on 10 August after joining Madsen for an interview onboard his home-built submarine.In April, Madsen was sentenced to life imprisonment, the country’s harshest possible sentence, for torturing, sexually assaulting and murdering the journalist, before dismembering her body and throwing it into the sea.The series is being made in close cooperation with Kim Wall’s parents, Ingrid and Joachim Wall, as well as with the Copenhagen police’s head of homicide, Jens Møller.“We decided early on that Kim’s fate should not be forgotten,” Wall’s parents said in the release in which they also said they trusted Lindholm to tell the story “from the right perspective and with respect for all who knew and loved Kim”.Lindholm said the involvement of Jensen and the Walls was “imperative” for him to be able to tackle the story with the same realism he had employed in his Oscar-nominated film A War, which was based on interviews with Danish soldiers serving in Afghanistan.“I wish, in the same manner, to make a crime series that cuts out all the colourful stuff and depicts the reality and the facts soberly and precisely,” he said.The film is being produced by Miso Film, a production company owned by the London-based Fremantle Media, in collaboration with Denmark’s TV 2 and Sweden’s TV4 and C More channels."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"If Denis Naughten\u0026rsquos behaviour inappropriate, \u0026lsquoso was that of those who arranged meetings\u0026rsquo, D\u0026aacuteil toldHundreds of horses in Dublin area council issued only 15 legally required licencesRussian cosmonaut and US astronaut \u0026lsquoin good condition\u0026rsquo after making emergency landingCharleton finds no evidence N\u0026oacuteir\u0026iacuten O\u0026rsquoSullivan played any \u0026lsquohand act or part\u0026rsquo in smear campaignBallinrobe, Banagher, Boyle, Callan, Cappoquin, Castleblayney selected for pilot projectProfiles of figures who played critical parts in the long-running Garda whistleblower sagaCork-based firm made \u0026euro4.9m profit in 2017 but paid key executives \u0026euro5.7m bonusOf \u0026euro2.5 million Garda stations\u0026rsquo fund, Stepaside refurbishment to cost \u0026euro1.5 millionA guide to the nine broad accusations of misconduct examined by the tribunalMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues updated weather warning as gusts of up to 130kmh are expectedTaoiseach said he was told of dinners on Thursday morningTribunal Judge highlights controversy caused by publicity around disclosuresDepartment of Health\u0026rsquos new building does not have the capacity to accommodate future anticipated staffing levels, Public Accounts Committee toldJoseph Hillen found not guilty of murdering taxi driver in row over alleged illegal dumpingTrial hears from Virgin Media worker who was one of the last people to see Dublin man aliveTribunal report finds Supt Taylor was \u0026lsquosuffused in bitterness\u0026rsquo against O\u0026rsquoSullivanFormer minister for justice exonerated by tribunal reportAnger grows over Minister\u0026rsquos contacts with lead bidder for State-backed \u0026euro500m planTrial of Filippo Lombardi (21) told he was one of two men involved in attack"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660382.1539275310!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"majority of funds to refurbish six garda stations to go to stepaside in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMaurice Buckley, chair of the Office of Public Works  confirmed Stepaside is expected to reopen next June. Photograph: Cyril ByrneAbout €1.5 million will be spent on refurbishing Stepaside Garda station while five other stations will be allocated a maximum of €1 million between them, the Public Accounts Committee (Pac) has been told. Maurice Buckley, chair of the Office of Public Works (OPW), confirmed Stepaside is expected to reopen next June, as part of an overall €2.5 million works package. It will mark the culmination of efforts by Minister for Transport Shane Ross, for whom the station’s reactivation was a key demand for entering government.The breakdown of funding was raised by Fianna Fáil’s Marc MacSharry who reminded the OPW that gardaí had previously said the reopening of Stepaside was not a priority. It has remained probably the most prominent of 139 stations that closed between 2012 and 2013, thanks in large part to the efforts of Mr Ross. Earlier plans to replace the former Garda station with prefabricated building were reversed in favour of refurbishment. In a statement this week, Mr Ross welcomed the decision to maintain the original building. “There is no need for a modular building on the grounds. This is something that the residents of Stepaside and surrounding environs have spent years fighting for,” he said. Elsewhere, the OPW confirmed that a site had been secured for a station in Sligo, the last of three required for a “bundle” outside Dublin to proceed. Work can now progress on those projects, which include Macroom, Co Cork and Clonmel, Co Tipperary.

But I believe in resigning, Denis has acted in the public interest. I am determined to see the National Broadband Plan through to completion.”Mr Varadkar said “sometimes there are days when I have to make decisions that may cause deep personal distress to others but are necessary for the good of the country.“Today is one of those days. I have known Denis for over twenty years and we were in Young Fine Gael together and I have had nothing but respect for him as a person and a politician. I know today is a difficult day for Denis and those close to him.“However, my job as Taoiseach must always be to put the public interest first.”Mr Varadkar also told the Dáil that he too had met Mr McCourt earlier this year.“For full disclosure I want to put on the record of the Dáil that I met Mr David McCourt on one occasion last March in the United States at a public event with the media present when I presented him with St Patrick’s Day Science Medal.“We did not discuss the National Broadband Programme,” he said.Mr Naughten had resigned earlier on Thursday afternoon.In a speech to the Dáil, he said the Taoiseach had told him he did not have confidence in him.He said “the outcome is more about opinion polls than telecom poles”.He insisted that there had been no political interference by him in the procurement process for the National Broadband Plan contract.In a shock announcement to a stunned Dáil, Mr Naughten said the Taoiseach “had asked me to reflect on my position”.He said he had met the Taoiseach last night and he had offered a confidential briefing to opposition spokespeople by the procurement team.He had also offered a review of his role and that to address concerns of the Opposition, he would not in any way try to second guess the outcome of the process. He had offered to assign responsibility for the process to his Minister of State Sean Kyne or another Cabinet-level Ministers.This was not accepted by An Taoiseach.“It is clear to me therefore that the Taoiseach does not have confidence in me.”Mr Naughten said that “if I was a cynic, which I’m not I believe the outcome is more about opinion polls than telecoms poles. It’s more about optics than fibre optics.”He insisted that as Minister he had to meet investors whether in telecoms or energy or any other sector. These are the people who provide jobs in this country, he said. And that is the context in which he had meetings with David McCourt , the key bidder for the broadband contract.He said that confidence did not exist even though he had introduced the first climate change national mitigation plan and national adaption plan.Mr Naughten said the evaluation process on the plan is expected to conclude at the end of this month.He asked that the procurement process to continue.His absolute priority has always been to provide access to highspeed broadband to every citizen in the country “and for no other reason whatsoever”, he said.He also said\u0026nbspthe real risk to the plan now lay in “loose language and irresponsible politics at this crucial time”.He was flanked by Minister of State Mary Mitchell O’Connor and Sean Kyne, with Minister for Transport Shane Ross and Minister of State Finian McGrath in attendance and five Fine Gael TDs sitting to his rear.The Minister said he had been left “in the impossible stark position that a politician never wants to find themself in. Do I make the decision myself to resign or waiting for that decision to be made for me.”He said “ I am absolutely satisfied that there has been no interference in the process by me”.Mr Naughten hit out at the “political and media frenzy” which he described as deeply unhelpful. He said the commentary by those who were not experts, that this procurement process was “dead in the water” and that the final bidder did not have the capacity to roll out the national development plan was “incorrect and had been deeply damaging”.This type of commentary was where the real risk to the broad plan arose, he said.He said the use of language had been “inflammatory, inaccurate and ill considered”.It had called into the question the integrity and capability of his officials and the external examiners.Mr Naughten and his Independent Ministerial colleagues left opposition TDs called for the Taoiseach to address the issues.No senior Minister was in the House after Mr Naughten left.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is to make a statement to the Dáil in the wake of the resignation.Government Chief Whip Joe Mc Hugh said that after the Taoiseach’s statement “normal business will resume”.Mr Naughten on Wednesday admitted he met David McCourt on two separate occasions and “facilitated” a lunch in the Dáil for him while the procurement process was ongoing.The Minister also paid for the €37 lunch but did not attend the lunch or speak to Mr McCourt on the day.On Wednesday in the Dáil the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar dismissed claims by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin that Mr Naughten “contaminated” the rural broadband tendering process by meeting a key member of last remaining consortium bidding for the €500 million contract.Mr Varadkar defended Mr Naughten’s meeting in New York in July with US businessman David McCourt and said it was acceptable “provided it conferred no advantage on Mr McCourt”.On Thursday morning, Mr Varadkar said he was satisfied “so far” with the Minister for Communications’ explanation over his meetings with the lead bidder for the National Broadband Plan.It emerged on Wednesday that Minister for Communications Denis Naughten paid for lunch for David McCourt, the chairman of Granahan McCourt, in Leinster House last April.Mr McCourt’s company is in line to secure one of the biggest public contracts ever awarded by the State, worth in excess of €500 million, should it succeed in winning the tender.Mr Naughten was due to deliver a 10-minute long defence of his actions at 3pm in the Dáil when his resignation was announced.The Taoiseach said on Thursday morning it was not unusual or wrong for the Minister to be engaging with industry. “In fact, that’s his job,” he told Virgin Media Television on Thursday.“There’s a whole protocol around how the engagement should take place, that there should be officials there for example, that matters relating to that contract shouldn’t be raised, that it should be minuted and recorded. Denis is in the Dáil this afternoon, he’s going to clarify all of that.”Mr Varadkar said he met with Mr Naughten on Wednesday evening. He said Mr Naughten has to come back to him with “a few more answers”, but when asked if he was satisfied on the matter, he said: “So far, yes.”Mr Varadkar said he accepted how the optics are problematic and perception does matter “in politics and in business too”.“But as I say Denis is going to be in the Dáil this afternoon and he’s going to clarify all of those aspects and I’d like to give him the opportunity to do that first,” he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660473.1539278868!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"questions raised over position of minister pat breen in broadband controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Dáil was told Minister of State Pat Breen organised and attended one of the private dinners between then minister for communications Denis Naughten and a key bidder for the rural broadband contract David McCourt.  Questions have been raised about the role of Minister of State Pat Breen in the broadband contract controversy.Mr Breen is Minister of State for Employment and Small Business and the Dáil was told on Thursday he organised and attended one of the private dinners between then minister for communications Denis Naughten and a key bidder for the rural broadband contract David McCourt.The dinner took place in Mr McCourt’s home in 2017 and was one of at least four private dinners Mr Naughten had with the US businessman. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the process had been compromised.Ms McDonald asked “what is the situation as regards Pat Breen” because he was also party to the arrangements and she asked the Taoiseach to confirm that he was still a Minister of State as Minister Naughten was gone. She asked if the Taoiseach had spoken to Mr Breen. The Taoiseach signalled to Ceann Comhairle Sean Fearghaíl who said there was no provision for questions.Ms McDonald said however that “there is still a question around Minister Breen”.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said that whatever about the propriety of arranging a dinner, when controversy arose recently about the dinner in Manhattan attended by Mr Naughten and Mr McCourt in July, Mr Breen should have informed the Dáil or the Taoiseach then that he had arranged another dinner between the two.He said Mr Breen’s position as Minister is also in question. Independent TD Michael Harty told the Taoiseach: “If you believe that Denis Naughten acted with impropriety you must also believe that those who arranged those meetings acted inappropriately as well.”Dr Harty, a Clare TD said “it does call into question the position of Minister Breen who is a constituency colleague of mine. I would not attack him on any personal level but certainly if he has been involved in this process he also has questions to answer.”Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy also questioned the probity of Mr Breen’s role.

She called for the introduction of ‘dog wardens’. File photograph.Social media images of animal cruelty can “distort” the very good work being done by the Department of Agriculture, local authorities and animal welfare charities to address the problem, the Dáil has heard.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed acknowledged that “we are all shamed by such incidents, which get a lot of traction, particularly on social media”.But he said “sometimes they distort the endeavour that is under way and the very good work being done”.But Independent TD Maureen O’Sullivan said there were “appalling cases of horse abuse”. The Dublin Central TD said animal welfare groups were picking up the pieces because the Animal Health and Welfare Act was not being enforced adequately.The Minister insisted that the welfare approach had resulted in a drop in the number of wandering animals.Horse seizures had continued to fall from 4,923 in 2014 to 1,603 last year and 806 to date this year, he said, adding that there had been a number of high profile animal welfare prosecutions.But Ms O’Sullivan rejected his comments about the local authorities and insisted that they were not enforcing the Act.“They just impound and kill animals or remove dead animals. In the past 11 months Tipperary County Council has spent €155,800 on removing dead horses.”She said there were hundreds of horses in the Dublin City Council area. Each was supposed to have a chip and a passport but the council had only issued 15 licences, she said.Ms O’Sullivan appealed to the Minister to authorise the appointment of horse wardens and she called for horses, ponies and donkeys to be micro-chipped, registered and kept in proper equine-registered properties.“We have dog wardens and litter wardens so could the department not give the lead with the local authorities?”She suggested they could start with a pilot scheme and that the local authorities could work with owners before the abuse started.Ms O’Sullivan said a horse warned could have a lorry that could impound animals on the spot with Garda protection if this is necessary.Mr Creed said the appointment of horse wardens was a matter for local authorities and the department could not instruct them about the matter. He said they had competing demands on their resources but he said the department did have consultation with councils.That discussion was ongoing and they could engage on the “hot spot” areas.He pointed out that funding of €1.04 million from the department had been used by a number of local authorities to support the development of urban-Traveller horse projects in their area.Mr Creed said that “in Irish society we celebrate the horse, the position of horse racing, sport horse and so on. But the urban horse is as much a part of that cultural story as any other”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3659928.1539245995!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar to be a named witness in case taken by 16 lesbian women and gay men","story":"Libel action was filed on (10th October) at the district court in Warsaw against Kaja Godek due to comments in a television discussion on May 30th following Ireland’s abortion referendum, in which she called Taoiseach Leo Varadkar a \u0027deviant\u0027. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne of the complainants in the case Jakub Urbanik outside court. Photograph: Marek MisiurewiczTaoiseach Leo Varadkar is to be a named witness in a defamation case against a Polish anti-abortion campaigner who described the politician’s homosexuality on television as “perversion”.The libel action was filed on Wednesday at the district court in Warsaw against Kaja Godek. On May 30th, in a television discussion following Ireland’s abortion referendum, Ms Godek said she was not surprised by the outcome of the vote given Ireland’s prime minister had flaunted his “bizarre” sexual orientation and shown “his perversion to the people”.Asked by the host if she was saying homosexuals were perverted, Ms Godek continued: “Yes, yes. If the prime minister of Ireland declares that he has a male sexual partner, if it is accepted as normal, it is monstrous that such a country should be defined as a Catholic country.”In later remarks she described Mr Varadkar’s homosexuality as an “ailment”, prompting a robust response from co-panellist Katarzyna Piekarska, a left-wing politician and Warsaw city councillor.“You should be ashamed of yourself that you define a person with a different orientation as a pervert,” she said.Ms Godek is co-founder of the Life and Family Foundation, behind two recent attempts to tighten Poland’s already restrictive abortion laws.She is being sued by 16 lesbian women and gay men, including LGBT rights activists and professors of law, who say they are injured parties.Aleksandra Muzinska, a co-president of the Love Does Not Exclude movement, described Ms Godek as “a symbol of homophobia in Poland”.“She is becoming more aggressive and we are trying to stop her because enough is enough,” she said. Polish campaigners said on Wednesday they were aware of the demands on Mr Varadkar’s time.“But it would be absolutely great to have him here to testify,” said Ms Muzinska. “Even a public statement would be very helpful.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cctv footage shows jamal khashoggi walking into saudi consulate","story":"  October 10, 2018Turkish investigators say Saudi leadership ordered murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi   October 11, 2018Turkish officials believe Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Saudi consulate in Istanbul "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660379.1539275199!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"harvey weinstein case charge dismissed over new information","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHarvey Weinstein sits during his hearing at Manhattan criminal court in New York, US. Photograph: Steven HirschPool via Reuters A New York judge on Thursday dismissed one of the six criminal charges against movie producer Harvey Weinstein after prosecutors said they could not oppose the dismissal in light of information they had learned while investigating the case.The dismissed charge concerns an alleged sexual assault of an aspiring actor by Mr Weinstein in 2004. Five other charges, involving alleged assaults of two other women, remain in the case in Manhattan criminal court. Mr Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.Mr Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he would seek dismissal of the remaining charges as well. He also said that he would investigate what he described as “perjury” before the grand jury that indicted Mr Weinstein, and the conduct of a New York City police detective involved in the case.The woman who accused Mr Weinstein of assaulting her in 2004, Lucia Evans, told the New Yorker in October 2017 that Mr Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him when she was a 21-year-old college student.“I want to be very clear that prosecutor’s decision to abandon my client’s claims does not invalidate the truth of her claims,” Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer for Ms Evans, told reporters outside the courthouse following Thursday’s hearing.Following the hearing, the office of Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance made public a letter it had sent to Mr Brafman last month disclosing that an unnamed witness had told them that she had heard an account of the alleged assault from Ms Evans that was different to the one Ms Evans gave to Mr Vance’s office.Mr Vance’s office also learned that the witness had given this other account to a New York City police detective, who failed to inform prosecutors, according to the letter.Mr Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone following accusations by more than 70 women, mostly young actors and other women employed in the movie business, of sexual misconduct, including rape, dating back decades.The accusations led to the #MeToo movement through which hundreds of women publicly accused powerful men in business, politics and entertainment of sexual harassment and abuse.As the accusations against Mr Weinstein mounted, his company The Weinstein Company fired him and filed for bankruptcy, and he was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000177321713_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"never forget face long dont see 5000 lifetime study university","story":"People can remember up to 10,000 faces, with the average person able to recall around 5,000, a new study has found.For the first time, psychologists have devised a method for estimating how many faces a person can remember.The “facial vocabulary” comprises both people known personally to an inidual and famous faces such as those of celebrities and politicians.A team at York University developed a laboratory technique based on a theory called recognition and recall that showed everyone fell within the 1,000 to 10,000 range.This is despite humans typically living and interacting in groups of smaller than 100 throughout evolution.For the study, 25 participants spent an hour writing down as many faces from their personal lives as possible, including those they went to school with, colleagues and family.They then did the same for famous faces.The participants found it easy to come up with lots of faces at first, but harder to think of new ones by the end of the hour.That change of pace allowed the researchers to estimate when they would run out of faces completely.The participants were also shown thousands of photographs of famous people, such as Barack Obama, and asked which ones they recognised.The researchers required participants to recognise two different photos of each person to ensure consistency.How good is your memory? Take our test to find outDr Rob Jenkins, who led the research, said: “The ability to distinguish different iniduals is clearly important - it allows you to keep track of people\u0027s behaviour over time, and to modify your own behaviour accordingly.The range could be explained by some people having a natural aptitude for remembering faces.There are differences in how much attention people pay to faces, and how efficiently they process the information.Alternatively, it could reflect different social environments - some participants may have grown up in more densely populated places with more social input.Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s Royal wedding venue: A look at St George\u0026#39s ChapelJoe Sugg\u0026#39s Strictly Diary: \u0026#39There may be a Strictly curse – but it’s not what you think\u0026#39Orphanages run by Catholic order were \u0026#39places of fear\u0026#39Skateboarder who attacked London Bridge terrorists given posthumous bravery awardComment: Ordinary people don\u0026#39t talk like politicians before they run for office –but we need them in politicsComment: Strip Craig Mackey of his knighthood for letting down police officers like me with his cowardly actionsChina says US fabricated spy case \u0026#39out of thin air\u0026#39Retired headteacher Antony Green, 77, and wife Delia, 75, named as victims of Majorca floodsBritish Army starts recruiting for revived Monuments Men unit to protect art and archaeology in warFlorida counts the devastating cost of Hurricane Michael ahead of peak holiday seasonGermany\u0026#39s far-Right urges schoolchildren to expose \u0026#39biased\u0026#39 teachersAfrica\u0026#39s youngest billionaire kidnapped in TanzaniaMalaysia set to abolish death penalty, in move which could spare lives of women accused of killing Kim Jong-namTheresa May faces new Cabinet revolt as her customs union backstop for Brexit \u0026#39has no time limit\u0026#39From self-spreading vaccines to 3D drugs: the tech that will stop a pandemicLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowBrussels blames Michel Barnier\u0026#39s interpreters for raising false hopes of Brexit dealTories risk repeat of poll tax backlash over Universal Credit roll out, warns Sir John MajorFaux leather promoted by \u0026#39ethical designers\u0026#39 like Stella McCartney is polluting the oceans with plastic, BBC expert saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000111038848_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"alone not lonely shutting door world keeps sane","story":"The number of Britons travelling on their tod is up by almost a thirdForget separate bedrooms, the secret to happiness is separate living rooms Britons are increasingly going it alone, whether they are alone or not.

State media showed rescuers helping the two crew members into a helicopter, and Nasa said the men were in good condition.“Vehicle malfunction. That was a quick flight,” Mr Ovchinin declared dryly over the radio at the beginning of the emergency descent.Rescuers help the two crew members out of a helicopter in KazakhstanThe crash comes after Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin accused Elon Musk of conspiring with the Pentagon to force other players out of the space industry and suggested that international astronauts had sabotaged the ISS by drilling the hole found in its hull.Adding to the embarrassment was a string of tweets by Roscosmos detailing the successful completion of three launch stages that never actually happened. The agency later deleted tweets with false information such as “287 seconds: The second stage successfully jettisoned”.  After a normal liftoff from the same launchpad from where Yury Gagarin began the first manned space flight, the accident occurred amid the transition from the four large launch boosters to the next set of engines. “Thank God the crew is alive,” Vladimir Putin\u0027s spokesman said. A Nasa statement blamed an “anomaly with the booster” for the incident and promised a thorough investigation.Part of the second stage may have gotten caught on the first due to “poor fastening,” pushing the craft off-course and causing the emergency shutdown of the engines, Interfax news agency quoted a space industry source as saying.   Further Roscosmos launches have been suspended, Mr Borisov said. Another two-man Russian-American crew had been scheduled to set out for the space station on 20 December. An American, a Russian and a German astronaut who had planned to return from the ISS on the Soyuz MS-10 ship will have to reconsider their plans. A plume of smoke trails behind the rocket before its crashBesides the two astronauts, the crashed rocket had been carrying supplies, but the ISS has enough reserves for another six months of operations. Roscosmos tweeted photographs of Mr Rogozin speaking with Mr Hague and Mr Ovchinin while they relaxed on couches with blood pressure and pulse monitors on their arms. After a medical examination they would fly back to Moscow, it said. Russian experts said the astronauts, both former military pilots, had been trained to withstand even more intense g-forces.A rescue team arrives at the capsule after it crash landed in the grasslands of Kazakhstan 250 miles from Baikonur cosmodromeA lengthening list of accidents has raised doubts about the state of Russia\u0027s space programme.   In a gross human error, an unmanned Soyuz rocket launched from Russia\u0027s new Vostochny cosmodrome in November crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after it was programmed with the launch coordinates for Baikonur.The disaster, which came after Mr Rogozin had declared the mission a success, destroyed 19 international satellites worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Russian unmanned cargo rockets of different designs crashed in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Alexei Ovchinin and Nick Hague wave to onlookers before boarding the spacecraftIn 2013, a Proton-M rocket carrying three satellites for the Glonass navigation system, Russia\u0027s rival to GPS, burst into flames and slammed into the crowd on live television. Mr Rogozin, who was sanctioned by the United States and European Union in 2014 over Russia\u0027s intervention in Ukraine crisis, lost his position as deputy prime minister this year but retained much of his influence with the appointment as head of Roscosmos. Speaking to state television on Thursday, he praised the calm actions of the crew and ground controllers but said conclusions about the crash could only come later.The ISS, which has been circling the earth at more than 17,000 miles per hour since 1998, is one of the few remaining areas of cooperation between Moscow and Washington amid rising political tensions.Mr Hague was born in 1975, the year the United States and Soviet Union launched their first joint space mission. Please review our commenting policyM\u0026ampS criticized for selling hijabs for school girls Princess

far right urges schoolchildren expose biased teachers","story":"AfD leader Alexander Gauland has been accused of paraphrasing Hitler Germany\u0027s far-right AfD party has been criticised for launching a child informant programme in schools where pupils expose teachers who attack the party or show political bias.The Hamburg chapter of Alternative Fur Deutschland, which made major gains in last year\u0027s general election, launched a Neutral Schools website for anonymous complaints about teachers.But Katarina Barley, the German justice minister, condemned the programme, warning that organised denunciation is a tool of dictatorships.  A party using this to expose disagreeable teachers ... reveals a lot about its own understanding of democracy, she added.German teaching unions also hit out at the Stasi-esque surveillance scheme, which the AfD hopes to extend to nine other states, including Bavaria, Brandenburg, Baden-Württemberg and Saxony.  It\u0027s to be expected that a party that wants to ostracise dissenters is now creating platforms to denounce people who have different opinions, Ilka Hoffmann, a board member of the German Education Union, told the Funke newspaper group.Teachers should be scared. This is a frightening development.  The AfD is the largest opposition party in the German parliament, the Bundestag, following a surge in support in the September 2017 election which handed them 90 seats. It has capitalised on popular anger against Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s liberal refugee policy that resulted in a record refugee influx in 2015.  But the extreme rhetoric of some of its members has led to claims that the party harbours neo-Nazi and fascist sympathisers. Alexander Gauland, the party\u0027s leader, has described the Third Reich as a speck of bird poo in over 1,000 years of successful German history.Another member, Bjoern Hoecke, condemned the Holocaust memorial in Berlin, complaining that Germans were the only people in the world who planted a memorial of shame in the heart of their capital.In a separate incident, Mr Gauland was accused of paraphrasing Hitler  in a newspaper column which railed against a globalised class which threatened his homeland.  Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s Royal wedding venue: A look at St George\u0026#39s ChapelJoe Sugg\u0026#39s Strictly Diary: \u0026#39There may be a Strictly curse – but it’s not what you think\u0026#39Orphanages run by Catholic order were \u0026#39places of fear\u0026#39Skateboarder who attacked London Bridge terrorists given posthumous bravery awardComment: Ordinary people don\u0026#39t talk like politicians before they run for office –but we need them in politicsComment: Strip Craig Mackey of his knighthood for letting down police officers like me with his cowardly actionsChina says US fabricated spy case \u0026#39out of thin air\u0026#39Retired headteacher Antony Green, 77, and wife Delia, 75, named as victims of Majorca floodsBritish Army starts recruiting for revived Monuments Men unit to protect art and archaeology in warFlorida counts the devastating cost of Hurricane Michael ahead of peak holiday seasonAfrica\u0026#39s youngest billionaire kidnapped in TanzaniaMalaysia set to abolish death penalty, in move which could spare lives of women accused of killing Kim Jong-namTheresa May faces new Cabinet revolt as her customs union backstop for Brexit \u0026#39has no time limit\u0026#39From self-spreading vaccines to 3D drugs: the tech that will stop a pandemicLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowBrussels blames Michel Barnier\u0026#39s interpreters for raising false hopes of Brexit dealTories risk repeat of poll tax backlash over Universal Credit roll out, warns Sir John MajorFaux leather promoted by \u0026#39ethical designers\u0026#39 like Stella McCartney is polluting the oceans with plastic, BBC expert saysComment: Tony Blair just made an incredible offer on Brexit – and you won’t want to miss outWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000177195299_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKIJTrz3Ias06JM6YNEP2rmWyvnsg2_xORUkxdK7-MzM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"kim jong uns new rolls royce shows north korean sanctions bit","story":"A Rolls Royce is visible in the background as Kim Jong-un arrives for a working lunch with Mike PompeoKim Jong-un attended his recent meeting with Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, in what appeared to be a new Rolls-Royce, in defiance of international sanctions as world powers fracture over restrictions against nuclear-armed North Korea.Images of Kim arriving show a jet black Rolls-Royce with darkened windows and a distinctive logo on its wheel hubs. It is unclear how the vehicle would have been transported to Pyongyang given United Nations sanctions that ban items including luxury automobiles and motor vehicles.The sanctions regime has become a bit of a joke, said Robert Dujarric, a professor of international relations at the Japan campus of Temple University. China and Russia have become increasingly vocal about loosening sanctions, splitting with the US on the issue.At three-way talks in Moscow, vice foreign ministers from North Korea, China and Russia agreed it is necessary to consider adjusting sanctions...at an appropriate time, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement.China and Russia first made the call to ease sanctions at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York late September. China argued they should be relaxed in view of the “positive development of the past few months, while Russia said the start of negotiations needed to be followed by lifting of restrictions.South Korea this week also said it was considering easing sanctions, but backed off the proposal after the US rejected the idea. The US has held strong on its views that sanctions should only disappear once North Korea has irreversibly denuclearised. Inside North Korea: fascinating images of the world\u0026#039s most secretive stateNorth Korea, sanctioned under multiple UN Security Council resolutions for its nuclear weapons programme, has repeatedly called for them to be rolled back after it halted nuclear and missile tests. Pyongyang has also agreed to allow international inspectors into those sites once US and North Korea officials agreen on logistics.Even with sanctions in place Mr Dujarric said getting around them for some items could be fairly simple.For instance, a North Korean operative could could easily buy a car from Rolls-Royce in London and ship it to China, where it could be trucked over the land border, said Mr Dujarric. The Phantom, which starts at £318,120, is not military-grade technology and would not have raised eyebrows. “The Chinese authorities are not going to make a fuss over a car, even if they know it is going to Mr Kim himself”, Mr Dujarric told The . China is North Korea\u0027s main ally.“In any case, it is quite clear that the sanctions are beginning to fade and neither China nor Russia are doing the US any favours on that front for their own reasons, he added. Please review our commenting policyPrincess Eugenie\u0026#39s Royal wedding venue: A look at St George\u0026#39s ChapelJoe Sugg\u0026#39s Strictly Diary: \u0026#39There may be a Strictly curse – but it’s not what you think\u0026#39Orphanages run by Catholic order were \u0026#39places of fear\u0026#39Skateboarder who attacked London Bridge terrorists given posthumous bravery awardComment: Ordinary people don\u0026#39t talk like politicians before they run for office –but we need them in politicsComment: Strip Craig Mackey of his knighthood for letting down police officers like me with his cowardly actionsChina says US fabricated spy case \u0026#39out of thin air\u0026#39Retired headteacher Antony Green, 77, and wife Delia, 75, named as victims of Majorca floodsBritish Army starts recruiting for revived Monuments Men unit to protect art and archaeology in warFlorida counts the devastating cost of Hurricane Michael ahead of peak holiday seasonGermany\u0026#39s far-Right urges schoolchildren to expose \u0026#39biased\u0026#39 teachersAfrica\u0026#39s youngest billionaire kidnapped in TanzaniaMalaysia set to abolish death penalty, in move which could spare lives of women accused of killing Kim Jong-namTheresa May faces new Cabinet revolt as her customs union backstop for Brexit \u0026#39has no time limit\u0026#39From self-spreading vaccines to 3D drugs: the tech that will stop a pandemicLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowBrussels blames Michel Barnier\u0026#39s interpreters for raising false hopes of Brexit dealTories risk repeat of poll tax backlash over Universal Credit roll out, warns Sir John MajorFaux leather promoted by \u0026#39ethical designers\u0026#39 like Stella McCartney is polluting the oceans with plastic, BBC expert saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000164465491_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqplGOf-dgG3z4gg9owgQTXDVXE4-NcPVfcZy5a1cUJ04.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"ofsted drop focus exam results curriculum casualty current system","story":"School inspections in England will no longer focus on exam results and grades, new proposals from Ofsted reveal. Instead, the substance of what children are being taught will be looked at.Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that the attention on performance data is coming at the expense of what is being taught.She said: We want to make this change because our inspections, our curriculum research, as well as a vast amount of sector feedback are telling us that focus on data is coming at the expense of what\u0027s taught in schools.So, we want to change that. We want to bring the inspection conversation back to the substance of what children learn and treat teachers as experts in their fields, not just data managers.Ms Spielman said Ofsted wanted to shift the focus on to what is being taught.We want to take a balanced view, we want to make sure that what we do complements what is shown in performance tables, she added.Ms Spielman is expected to use her speech at the Schools NorthEast Summit in Newcastle to say that inspections have placed too much weight on exam results.The BBC reports that she will say: The cumulative impact of performance tables and inspections, and the consequences that are hung on them, has increased the pressure on school leaders, teachers and indirectly on pupils to deliver perfect data above all else.But we know that focusing too narrowly on test and exam results can often leave little time or energy for hard thinking about the curriculum, and in fact can sometimes end up making a casualty of it.The bottom line is that we must make sure that we, as an inspectorate, complement rather than intensify performance data.One of the biggest proposed changes to the inspection framework is for the pupil outcomes section to be replaced with a new judgment on quality of education, it has been reported.Effectiveness of leadership and managementQuality of teaching, learning and assessmentPersonal development, behaviour and welfareOutcomes for children and learnersBehaviour and attitudesSchools\u0027 leadership and managementTalking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Spielman said that some subjects - such as English and maths - had been given more prominence in schools, who had lost sight of those things that are harder to measure.She added that Education Secretary Damian Hinds agrees entirely with our analysis of the problems.What matters here is that results are achieved in the right way. That children are being taught a really good curriculum, and taught it really well. Where schools have the confidence to do that - good results will flow.Where it doesn\u0027t work is where you have schools chasing results for results\u0027 sake - that\u0027s where the education gets stripped out. We are proposing to getting back to looking at that substance.A fortnight after headteachers marched outside Downing Street over the lack of funding for schools, Ms Spielman refused to demand more money from the Government.  She said: There\u0027s been quite a lot of discussion about this. Our system is funded fairly well on the international scale. This is not a badly-funded system. We are the inspectorate - we judge what\u0027s coming out of schools. At the moment, there\u0027s a relatively small focus on curriculum, and we don\u0027t see some of the subjects that are getting lost. The announcement comes after increased pressure on Ofsted to change the way it works.In September, a Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report suggested the inspection body is losing its credibility.The House of Commons committee said significant cuts in Ofsted\u0027s budget have led it and the Department for Education (DfE) to focus more on the cost of inspections rather than obtaining assurances about schools\u0027 effectiveness.In the same month, the Improving School Accountability report by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said the body should scrap its outstanding rating and replace it with a more robust system for identifying specific excellence.It also recommended that Ofsted adopt a new role focusing on identifying failure, saying the current system limits ambition, incentivises self-interest and erts attention from teaching and learning.A consultation on the new Ofsted inspection proposals will be launched in January, with intention to start using them at the start of the school year in September 2019.Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s Royal wedding venue: A look at St George\u0026#39s ChapelJoe Sugg\u0026#39s Strictly Diary: \u0026#39There

Independent CultureA Banksy artwork self-destructed moments after it was sold for £1m to an anonymous phone bidder at Sotheby’s auction house.Girl with\u0026nbspBalloon was shredded by a mechanism hidden within its own frame in front of a stunned audience in London on Friday night.Banksy, whose true identity remains unknown, celebrated the prank with a post on Instagram with the caption: “Going going gone”.“It appears we just got Banksy-ed,” said Alex Branczik, Sotheby’s senior director and head of contemporary art.The 2006 artwork, which depicts a girl reaching out to a red heart-shaped balloon and is one of Banksy’s most iconic images, was valued at around £300,000 but eventually sold for £1,042,000.As the gavel went down to signal the end of the auction at 9pm, an alarm went off and the canvas began sliding downwards through the frame.It emerged at the bottom sliced into ribbons, prompting officials to rush in to take the artwork from the wall in a doomed bid to save it.Sotheby’s described the surprise as “instant art world folklore” and said it marked “the first time in auction history that a work of art automatically shredded itself after coming under the hammer.”The auction house said that the successful bidder was “surprised by the story” and added: “We are in discussion about next steps”.Last year, the musician and DJ Goldie appeared to let slip that he was called Robert, an apparent reference to Massive Attack member Robert del Naja.The artist first achieved notoriety\u0026nbspwith a series of graffiti pieces that appeared on buildings across the country and later became involved in a public battle with rival King Robbo, who died in 2014.Created with Sketch.Has Banksy\u0027s real identity been discovered at last?

Once upon a time, this dramatic 1920s building was the printing works for the Daily Mirror, whose presses belted out millions of copies of the newspaper: at its peak, seven million Mirror copies a day were printed here.Now Herbal House – as its called today –\u0026nbspis the European headquarters of Photobox. It’s still in the print business, but it’s also a digital one which produced more than 22 million personalised books and gift cards for more than 10 million customers in 15 countries last year.Jody Ford, chief executive of Photobox, chose the building as the group’s new £20m HQ because he likes the link to the past but also because Clerkenwell is back buzzing as London’s most creative district.It certainly feels buzzy. The guts of the building have been ripped out to expose huge concrete and steel girders which give the place a raw industrial twist. Yet the atmosphere is warm and teeming with laid-back young techies dressed in jeans and sneakers who look to be more at play than work.Each of the four floors is colour-coded using the CMYK formula at the heart of all print shops. The ground floor is yellow for Moonpig, and one floor below is pink for Photobox. Downstairs in the bowels – where staff meet on Friday afternoons for “soapbox”\u0026nbspstyle chats with colleagues to bash around new ideas and for weekly yoga sessions – is blue.A View from the Top: Ashley Schofield, the new CEO of giffgaffUpstairs on the first floor the colour is black:\u0026nbspthat’s for management style group functions. It’s in one of the blue “breakout”\u0026nbsprooms that Ford meets me for our chat: he doesn’t have his own office as such. Nor do staff: it’s all open-plan. The 400 employees work in teams and “squads”,\u0026nbspin their coloured sections, and are encouraged to think out of the box: welcome to agile working. If all this sounds a little west coast-ish, that’s because much of Ford’s leadership thinking was formed in Silicon Valley. After studying for an MBA at Insead and a few years at McKinsey, Ford cut his teeth at eBay, the tough way. His first job was in eBay’s second-hand car market and then on helping to build eBay’s fashion business with brands like Karen Millen and Superdry.After six years, he was promoted to eBay’s HQ in San Jose, shooting up the ranks to become head of global growth marketing. Californian life was great for him and his young family, he says, but also for hanging out with the valley’s Yahoo to Google crowd.Then came the call. The private equity owners of Photobox wanted him to take over the hot seat with express orders to shake it up. The 18-year-old business, which had expanded rapidly into Europe by buying Moonpig and Hofmann, had been bought by Electra Partners and Exponent\u0026nbspfor around £400m, after plans to float were shelved.“It was an offer I couldn’t refuse. I am the guy who puts together the Photobox photos for the books. I’m the one who puts together the music for parties and makes the playlists.”He lets on that while at Exeter – where he studied economics and politics – \u0026nbsphe was a regular DJ on the university radio, Xpression FM. “I was an indie kid, played Blur, Oasis, Radiohead and dance music.” (He trained with Formula 1 commentator Ted Kravitz).“I still play dance music whenever I can with my kids: they think I’m a pretty cool dad. O god, I’ve said far too much,” he says, with a big laugh.His kids are right. The 43-year-old is cool, and as bright as a button too. Even so he will need some big tunes to meet his ambition to take Photobox from annual sales of £325m last year – and profits of £47m – to sales of £1bn over the next few years.So far, so good. Photobox is the biggest digital personalised printing business in Europe, and is growing internationally too.Demand for digital books created by Photobox, and products from its sister brands including Moonpig, the Spanish Hofmann business and Germany’s posterXXL, is booming despite the squeeze on consumer spending. And in ways that are difficult to predict.Chili plants and craft beers are still favourites to give as gifts for Father’s day. Specialist gins have become the must-have present for Mother’s Day celebrations – although tulips remain the favourite flowers to give.You can also now have your beloved’s face – or whatever – printed on just about everything, from playing cards to mugs to pillows or beach towels.Whatever next ? Well, if you want to know, Photobox reports a rise in cards for “palentines”\u0026nbspand “galentines”: shorthand for friends celebrating each other. Special cards for Nan, Grandma and Grandmother are growing like topsy as generations live longer. There is also a boom in cards for “pre-mother” women and from the “bump”\u0026nbspbeing sent by fathers or partners to expectant mothers. And cards for pets.At the same time, Photobox is launching its own curated products. One of these is a new Artist Collection, “gallery-quality”\u0026nbspart prints selected for you by interior stylist Pippa Jameson.That’s the front end of Ford’s business, the bit we see. The back end is less visible, much of it hidden in the cloud. There are now 7.8 billion photos uploaded onto the Photobox platform which is in the process of migrating a whopping 9 petabytes of data onto Amazon’s web services to keep it secure.A View from the Top with Eugen Miropolski, WeWork’s managing directorWhat it’s like to be the chief executive of two companies at onceA view from the top: Veeam boss Peter McKay on sales and cyclingParis is the hotbed of technical expertise where 60 specialist AI and machine-learning experts work on the photo management. As well as the London HQ, there are another 200 people based in Munich working on the German brands. Another 300 or so people are based across five manufacturing sites where the books and card gifts are made and posted out around the world. These are spread across the UK, Guernsey, Spain, France and Germany.A new tech hub for Moonpig is being set up in Manchester as we speak, and is about to start a big recruitment drive to hire the best engineering talent around.Nurturing talent is top of Ford’s agenda. One of his first moves was to bring in a new top team of managers, updating functions like human resources. Everybody has the chance to be coached, and it’s a move that has already paid off.Moonpig, which made some 65 million personalised cards last year,\u0026nbsphas seen internal targets soar by 300 per cent. Ford has also introduced a Be That Manager programme for all 150 managers.“It’s not a one-off development course. We want to create a culture of lifelong learning.”Finding the best talent is also the scary bit, he says. “I spend a lot of my time worrying about whether we have the best people we can find, the best engineers, the best innovators. And whether they will want to come here to work.”My hunch is they might rather enjoy\u0026nbspthemselves.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is no introductory rate - 1.5 per cent rate applies at all times that the account is open, as long as the holder deposits at least £50 a month.However, the rate only applies to to the first £10,000, which is some way short of Goldman\u0027s account which pays 1.5 per cent up to £250,000.Another new account from RBS, the Premium Saver, pays 0.85 per cent and is designed for customers with a lump sum ready to invest.\u0026nbspAlan Hardie, head of products at RBS said, “Offering an account which encourages saving but also offers flexibility when people need access to their money, enables our customers to have more control over how they manage their money.”RBS still shooting itself in the foot ten years on from its £45bn baiRBS boss Ross McEwan warns no-deal Brexit could push UK into recessionRBS and Natwest online and mobile banking services restored, bank saysRBS boss \u0027withheld information about criminal investigation from MPs\u0027RBS to close 54 more branches and cut hundreds of jobsRBS is the first UK bank to announce new accounts since Goldman entered the UK market.

As well as the two phones – the smaller and bigger version – there was\u0026nbspa new version of the Google Home voice assistant that has a screen, as well as a\u0026nbspnew tablet.Most of the new devices had already been leaked ahead of the official unveiling, but Google still managed a few surprises, especially with its exceptional camera.A full round-up of the event can be found below.As we wait for everything to get started, perhaps it\u0027s worth taking a trip down memory lane to where it all began: the original Pixel. I reviewed it in glowing terms all the way back in 2016, and I think the phone has kept up the promises it showed at that time.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s that original review.With the launch of Indy Minds, we\u0027re offering editors\u0027 letters, which offer a little peek behind the scenes here. And I\u0027ve written today\u0027s, which covers the Google launch as well as our preparations and thoughts. You can take a look at here if you like.Google has lots going on today, not all of it quite as fun or as exciting as the Pixel. For instance, it just disclosed there was a major hack of Google+, and that it\u0027s shutting down.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s why that\u0027s important, even if you don\u0027t consider yourself a Google+ user (which, well, who among us does).We\u0027re starting off with a bit of an unusual video about all of the leaks there have been relating to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. And there have been a lot.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe soundtrack\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsp\u0027Help\u0027 by The Beatles – a hint for things to come perhaps? Google Assistant anyone?Rick Osterloh comes on stage to tell us that 2018 marks the 20th anniversary of Google. It\u0027s fair to say the company has achieved a lot in that time, but Osterloh doesn\u0027t have time to tell us about all of that. He\u0027s here to talk about the Pixel.\u0026nbspMany of you in this room say last year\u0027s Pixel 2 still takes the best photos even after a year with so many amazing phones, he says, before moving on to the AI technology that makes this possible.From out of a pedestal in the middle of the room, appear three devices: The Pixel 3, Pixel Slate and Google Home Hub.\u0026nbspEager reporters are crowding around to get a picture, as Osterloh races through the announcements.\u0026nbspThe Pixel Slate apparently brings the power and productivity of a desktop to a tablet, according to Osterloh. Google definitely isn\u0027t the first to make that claim.\u0026nbspThe Google Home Hub, as you might imagine, is for the home. The smart home in 2018 is too complex, he says. I dunno if a brand new device is the way to make things any clearer.Diya Jolly, Google\u0027s vice president of product management, comes on stage to talk about the smart home, revealing that queries to Google Home has gone up 400 per cent in the past year.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNow imagine not just hearing\u0026nbspa response, but being able to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspa response. That is the power of Google Home Hub, she says, referencing the screen that accompanies the hub, as she refers to it.It\u0027s a bit like the Portal device that Facebook unveiled this week, however there is one key difference.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe\u0026nbspconsciously did not put a camera on the Hub so that is comfortable to use in private spaces like the bedroom, she says.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s\u0026nbsplots\u0026nbspof digital wellbeing here. It\u0027s been a major part of every announcement. The Hub, for instance, can be put into a special downtime mode so that it won\u0027t bother you the Slate will start to go to sleep at night time. Like Anthony said about the Hub\u0027s lack of cameras, it\u0027s hard to read Google and Apple\u0027s focus on this stuff as anything but a shot at people like Facebook, even if they aren\u0027t doing it consciously.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3240 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3340 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3440 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3540 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3640 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3740 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.3840 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2440 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2740 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2840 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2940 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I was employed\u0026nbspas Tim Rice’s assistant. Abba had just disbanded and my first job was to go to meet Björn from the airport. I’d always loved the Abba songs but that was when I fell in love with them. Meeting Benny and Björn\u0026nbspand working with them over the next five years, I became extremely interested in those songs, which I think they thought they had left behind, as they were working on other musical projects.When I was younger, I was an Abba fan but I was more into Bowie, and I went through the rock phase of the\u0026nbspLed Zeppelins and the Emerson, Lake and Palmers. I loved “Dancing Queen”\u0026nbspbut I never went to an Abba concert.Mamma Mia 2 star Cher takes a chance on selling her Beverly Hills homeWhy ‘Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again’ is our antidote to BrexitLily James on playing a young Meryl Streep, and singing Abba for AbbaAll the ABBA songs featured in Mamma Mia 2Yet\u0026nbspI was compelled by the songs and by meeting the guys. The song “The Winner Takes it All” was the inspiration for Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspand when I met Björn I wanted to know what must have been going round in his head when he wrote that song.It’s a huge romancebreakup song\u0026nbspa woman having a conversation in her head with a man who has hurt her and let her down or maybe cheated on her. “Tell me does she kiss,\u0026nbsplike\u0026nbspI used to kiss you?” The lyrics are full of hurt it’s a roller coaster of emotions. But how do you make a musical out of a song that is taking you towards Greek tragedy? That’s what I love about Abba songs. They take you on this journey, and even if they hit a certain emotional spot, you’re still left feeling in a good mood.I felt the idea of hearing somebody sing that song in the theatre was like “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina”\u0026nbspit was “the 11 o’clock number “ as they say on Broadway –\u0026nbspthe second act showstopper.Benny and Björn were against anything that would be a tribute or a biographical story but that\u0026nbspdidn’t interest me either. Björn was interested at first more than Benny because the musical was to use\u0026nbsphis lyrics as the source material. Those amazing words took us through the stage show and now two films.It was funny working on the second film because people would say:\u0026nbsp“Are there enough songs?”\u0026nbspI certainly thought there were, and, in fact, I think there’s a whole new audience that didn’t know Abba, didn’t grow up with Abba, didn’t know them as a band and yet\u0026nbspknow those songs as Mamma Mia! That tickles Benny and Björn quite a lot.The girls haven’t been so involved because Benny and Björn wrote the songs. But Frida has always been very supportive. And Agnetha too for that matter.Of course, I was passionate and keen about the show, but I had to work hard to convince people that it wasn’t just a\u0026nbspperformance in which\u0026nbsppeople were going to be dressing up as Frida and Agnetha, and Benny and Björn.I knew those songs worked for two generations. For the younger audience members there was “Honey Honey” and “Dancing Queen”, the dancing songs. And then there’s the\u0026nbspmore emotional breakup songs, perhaps for older fans. I toyed with different ideas\u0026nbspthen in the mid-Nineties, Björn\u0026nbsptold me that\u0026nbspif I could\u0026nbspfind the right story\u0026nbsphe and Benny\u0026nbspmight be interested.That’s when I met playwright Catherine Johnson and pitched all my thoughts to her about generations, and how the theme of the production\u0026nbsphad to be weddings or holidays. I felt it had to be something nostalgic that took you to a happy place and Catherine\u0026nbspcame up with the genius mother-daughter idea\u0026nbspset around a wedding, and examining the relationship between a\u0026nbspmother and a daughter\u0026nbsp– and\u0026nbspthree possible fathers. And that immediately appealed to Björn and Benny.I hadn’t thought at that stage of the possibility of it becoming a film – I thought it might make a small TV film. But I always had a pull towards a stage show. And now I’ve overseen\u0026nbsp50 productions.The stakes were high because Mamma Mia! had done 20 years in London\u0026nbspand the first movie had been one of the most successful musical films ever.I had seen Love Actually. I adored Richard Curtis’s work. If we were to do another film we had to explore different emotions, and he is so brilliant not just at romance but also taking risks on life and loss: at the heart of all his comedies is\u0026nbsploss. He thought about this in the sense of going back and forth and to different places,\u0026nbspand all he had to say to me was “The Godfather: Part II” and I completely got it.You have to have ‘Dancing Queen’. Why would you go to see your favourite band if they’re not going to play your favourite songs?Even the music is like The Godfather: Part II\u0026nbsprich sweeping ballads. It underscores. There’s a rich palate of Abba in there.It was always the intention to reuse songs from the first film. You have to have “Dancing Queen”. Why would you go to see your favourite band if they’re not going to play your favourite songs?There were songs that I knew still had the power of storytelling and also the power of comedy,\u0026nbspsomething fun that has come from the stage show,\u0026nbspwhether it’s “Chiquitita” or “Take a Chance”.\u0026nbspBrosnan (PA)Curtis said he loved Mamma Mia! and\u0026nbspAbba\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand though he didn’t have time to write the screenplay\u0026nbsphimself, he\u0026nbspwas happy to support our endeavours, especially if there was a writer he liked and wanted to work with. That person was Ol Parker, who came on board as a writer at that time (and then later became the director).So, it was a matter of making the story work.\u0026nbspMeryl Streep\u0026nbsphad always been affectionate towards the original\u0026nbspMamma Mia! and was keen on being in a possible\u0026nbspsequel but I knew she was never\u0026nbspgoing to take on a role as big as the first one. And for her to be part of it, what song? You can’t really top “The Winner Takes it All” from the first film, and she wasn’t going to be running along rooftops and jumping off cliffs singing lots of Abba songs. “My Love, My Life” is an incredibly affecting song and I think equal to “The Winner Takes it All”.Created with Sketch.ABBA: Eurovision victory in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Abba performs their song Waterloo during the Eurovision Song ContestAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA give the thumbs up after winning the Eurovision Song Contest with their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027ABBA posing at Waterloo railway station.Anna and Frida singing Sweden\u0027s entry, Waterloo, during a dress rehearsal in BrightonAbba meet a mounted policeman as they relax in Brighton, after their victory in the Eurovision Song ContestABBA in BrightonAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA during a photocall in London to promote their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027 before the Eurovision song contestBenny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog and Bjorn Ulvaeus posing at Waterloo railway stationAbba strolling hand in hand amongst the daffodils in Hyde ParkAbba after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in BrightonAbba arriving at London Airport Abba performs their song Waterloo during the Eurovision Song ContestAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA give the thumbs up after winning the Eurovision Song Contest with their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027ABBA posing at Waterloo railway station.Anna and Frida singing Sweden\u0027s entry, Waterloo, during a dress rehearsal in BrightonAbba meet a mounted policeman as they relax in Brighton, after their victory in the Eurovision Song ContestABBA in BrightonAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA during a photocall in London to promote their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027 before the Eurovision song contestBenny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog and Bjorn Ulvaeus posing at Waterloo railway stationAbba strolling hand in hand amongst the daffodils in Hyde ParkAbba after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in BrightonAbba arriving at London Airport I’m going to claim Cher as my idea, though Ol would probably also claim it as his.\u0026nbspI’ve always loved Cher\u0026nbspand had a conversation with her for the last movie before we cast Christine Baranski to see whether Cher would be interested in playing\u0026nbspTania then. She wasn’t, but she said to me recently it worked out well this way round.\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspalso felt that\u0026nbspif we were going to do a second film, well\u0026nbspwe had hit a high with Meryl on the first\u0026nbspand now we’d\u0026nbspgot to hit it out of the park. Who is one of the greatest actors who can sing? There’s Cher, there’s Bette\u0026nbspMidler and there’s Barbra Streisand. There was always going to be a mother character. Ol wrote the part\u0026nbspas the ultimate rock chick, and with Cher in mind. I was always fixated that Cher would be the perfect casting.Mamma Mia! has traditionally had great female roles that we lack in musical theatre and in movies and Cher really embraced it.\u0026nbspFor both films\u0026nbspwe cast brilliant actors. And\u0026nbspnow we\u0026nbsphave three generations, with Cher and Meryl Christine\u0026nbspBaranski\u0026nbspand Julie Walters\u0026nbspand Amanda Seyfried and the Lily James generation – and Cher gets the guy.“Fernando” was a favourite Abba song of hers and it was tempting for her to sing it.\u0026nbspI think with this film we could have a wink at the audience with how we use this old song, and it’s a brilliant moment when she and Andy Garcia (Fernando) discover each other again\u0026nbspand she tells that story through the power of her voice. You feel she was probably rebelling as a young woman in her early 20s, and then probably again when she was Donna Sheridan’s mum\u0026nbsphanging out at Studio 54 too much. And now we see her come back in her full glory as Ruby Sheridan – or as Cher, in fact.Saudi woman barred from marrying man ‘because he plays a instrument’Lily James on playing a young Meryl Streep, and singing Abba for AbbaAll the ABBA songs featured in Mamma Mia 2It was said that the last film\u0026nbspinvigorated people\u0026nbspand I think it probably did. We ran all summer, the summer of the financial crash, and it brought people of every age to the cinema. As a show we opened at the most tragic of all times in New York, the time of 911. You’ve got this massive show and one of the worst tragedies that you can imagine. How do you deal with that? With everyone involved\u0026nbspand the city in complete crisis, while people have\u0026nbspto keep going and\u0026nbspearn a living?It was a difficult time but the then-mayor, Rudy Giuliani, was incredibly galvanising to the Broadway community. People asked us:\u0026nbsp“Are you still going to open?” The answer had to be “yes”.\u0026nbspEveryone thought about it a lot and I know Phyllida sat and talked to the cast when we were rehearsing, it was almost like a therapy. But it was the best thing for everyone to make the show happen.I don’t think there will be a “Mamma Mia 3!”. It’s great that people are thinking that way I think people feel very safe with Mamma Mia! and this new movie has a lot more emotional heft, and it really makes you laugh and cry:\u0026nbspit’s a shared experience. And those songs, of course. They said, back when the show opened: “Oh people don’t always know those Abba songs.”\u0026nbspBut now “When I Kissed the Teacher”\u0026nbsp– the opening song on the movie – has\u0026nbspbeen\u0026nbsptrending on Spotify.Mamma Mia! was way before social media in the case of the stage show even the first\u0026nbspmovie came out before social media was the force it is now. Today, it’s a massive tool for marketing and communication, enabling us to\u0026nbspappeal to a younger audience. So it’s fascinating that I see on social media\u0026nbspa younger audience going:\u0026nbsp“Please do ‘Mamma Mia 3’.” That’s the natural thing for them.One person even said: “Why can’t it become the new Fast and Furious?”\u0026nbsp– that made me laugh a lot.Judy Craymer was talking to David Lister“MAMMA MIA!

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no introductory rate - 1.5 per cent rate applies at all times that the account is open, as long as the holder deposits at least £50 a month.However, the rate only applies to to the first £10,000, which is some way short of Goldman\u0027s account which pays 1.5 per cent up to £250,000.Another new account from RBS, the Premium Saver, pays 0.85 per cent and is designed for customers with a lump sum ready to invest.\u0026nbspAlan Hardie, head of products at RBS said, “Offering an account which encourages saving but also offers flexibility when people need access to their money, enables our customers to have more control over how they manage their money.”RBS still shooting itself in the foot ten years on from its £45bn baiRBS boss Ross McEwan warns no-deal Brexit could push UK into recessionRBS and Natwest online and mobile banking services restored, bank saysRBS boss \u0027withheld information about criminal investigation from MPs\u0027RBS to close 54 more branches and cut hundreds of jobsRBS is the first UK bank to announce new accounts since Goldman entered the UK market.

their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor

participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchDescribed by Professor Coveney as the “medical equivalent of weather forecasting”, his work uses supercomputers to simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalBecause Professor Hawking suggested that black holes have a temperature and so would eventually cool down and evaporate, disappearing entirely from existence. With that, they appear to take the information with them, but it cannot simply be lost without breaking the laws of quantum mechanics.But the new paper suggests that can be explained by the phenomenon of soft hair. That is a sort of glossy edge\u0026nbspthat sits at the edge of the black hole and allows for scientists to overcome the paradox.Hawking memorial sees professor\u0027s voice shot into a black holeNow the researchers who worked with Professor Hawking on the paper in his final days will have to explore more of how exactly that works without him. They hope to find out how exactly the soft hair works, and what happens to it when the black hole comes to an end.The study itself – which is attributed to\u0026nbspSasha Haco, Stephen W. Hawking, Malcolm J. Perry and\u0026nbspAndrew Strominger –\u0026nbspdescribes that process in far more technical detail. The summary concludes with a sentence that reads: Assuming the existence of a quantum Hilbert space on which these charges generate the symmetries, as well as the applicability of the Cardy formula, the central charges reproduce the macroscopic area-entropy law for generic Kerr black holes.But at its most simple level it could be part of a solution to a problem that has occupied many of the greatest minds in the world for decades, according to researchers.“Understanding the microscopic origin of this entropy – what are the underlying quantum states that the entropy counts? – has been one of the great challenges of the last 40 years,\u0026nbspMarika Taylor, professor of theoretical physics at Southampton University and a former student of Hawking’s, told , which had first reported the new paper.This paper proposes a way to understand entropy for astrophysical black holes based on symmetries of the event horizon. The authors have to make several non-trivial assumptions so the next steps will be to show that these assumptions are valid.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

case in the county court and then at the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.However the owners of the bakery, the McArthur family, challenged those rulings at a Supreme Court hearing in Belfast in May.In a brief statement announcing the court\u0027s decision, its president, Lady Hale, said bakers did not refuse to fulfil his order because of his sexual orientation,\u0026nbspthey would have refused to make such a cake for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation.She added: Their objection was to the message on the cake, not to the personal characteristics of Mr Lee or of anyone else with whom he was associated.Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK or Ireland where same-sex marriage is outlawed, with Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s DUP allies staunch opponents of changing the law.Mr Lee said he is considering his options regarding an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.Responding to the refusal to hand over the images, Ciarán Kelly, deputy director

have\u0026nbspbeen carried on the wind from Austria or Germany, but no one knows precisely what chemicals caused a stench that was like \u0027chlorine meets TCPDettol\u0026nbspmeets battery acid\u0027\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentNear Waterloo Bridge the strange smell was likened to \u0027chlorine meets TCPDettol meets battery acid\u0027It began somewhere around Wapping,\u0026nbspslightly to the east of the Tower of London.Accompanied by reports of some sort of fog, the stench – or at least awareness of it – seemed to spread east and west along the river, inviting comparisons with “chlorine meets TCPDettol meets battery acid” near Waterloo Bridge, and prompting Billy Kingsmill in East Ham to demand: “What the eff is it?”As reports of the “burningchemicalmetallic” smell crept past the Houses of Parliament towards Victoria and Paddington stations, comparisons were made with the Great Stink of London of 1858, which forced even MPs to do something about the dreadful state of sanitation in the capital.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspWednesday, then, was the wrong day for Kew Gardens to start boasting about its corpse flower with “one of the foulest odours in the plant kingdom”.By Thursday morning\u0026nbspthe smell had gone and the air quality had returned to good, but the questions remained, along, in some cases, with concerns about sore throats, sore lungs and headaches.What exactly had caused the great(ish) stink of 2018?\u0026nbsp How worried should the citizens of London be?\u0026nbsp And could the politan Police have shown a little more interest when one concerned Twitter user drew their attention to the foul smell enveloping the capital?For answers, The Independent turned to Dr Thomas Smith, assistant professor of environmental geography at the London School of Economics (LSE).\u0026nbspHe, like many others, had noticed the weird smell.Unlike many others, however, Dr Smith had a “laser egg”.Air pollution now ‘biggest environmental risk in Europe’This small device can measure air quality by counting\u0026nbspparticles in the air that are two-and-a-half microns or less in width and therefore small enough to be breathed into the lungs.The laser egg was stationed on the roof of the LSE’s St Clement’s building, near Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and was readable via an app on Dr Smith’s mobile phone.When Dr Smith noticed the stink while working in his fourth floor office, he checked the reading on his phone.\u0026nbspThen he went onto the roof to check that no students were skewing the results by smoking near the laser egg.No one was having a crafty fag near the laser egg.\u0026nbspThe result was real. \u0026nbspAs Dr Smith duly tweeted at 9.48pm, his machine had given an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 102, in the “unhealthy” range for people with pre-existing lung conditions and the highest pollution level that particular device had ever recorded.Alas, however, Dr Smith’s relatively inexpensive laser egg could only count the offending particles, not say what they were.He could, though, offer some speculation about where they came from. \u0026nbspAlthough Dr Smith didn’t put it like that.“Whatever it was,” he added, “It probably came from places beyond the remit of the UK Environment Agency.”When we consulted the experts at the London Air Quality Network at King’s College, London, they confirmed that Dr Smith’s hunch was broadly correct.Created with Sketch.The worst countries in the world for air pollution deaths Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.610 Bosnia and Herzegovina610 Bosnia and HerzegovinaTimothy Baker, the principal air quality analyst,\u0026nbspsaid London had received a dose of Austrian and German air, although home-grown emissions, especially from traffic during the evening rush hour, had also been partly to blame for Wednesday’s poor air quality.Mr Baker said: “What our monitoring equipment picked up on was a marked increase in the types of particles that are formed as a result of distant air pollution reacting in the atmosphere as it comes towards us.Mr Baker said that on Wednesday a high nitrate count – produced from particles originating in Austrian and German cars and domestic heating – was largely to blame for producing poor air quality in terms of potential to irritate lungs.But in terms of what so irritated the noses of Londoners, Mr Baker was unable to identify the chemical culprit for that industrial-seeming stench.What causes unhealthy air quality and what causes a nasty smell can sometimes be two completely separate things, Mr Baker explained.\u0026nbspThe irony with air pollution was, he said:\u0026nbsp“The side of it that is causing a lot of damage to people’s health is often undetectable.“The issue tends to attract attention when there is something people can see or smell, but there can be worse particle episodes that most people don’t notice.”Mr Baker was willing to speculate that the Austrian and German urban areas that produced pollution from vehicles and domestic heating may also have contained industrial units pumping out things that ended up stinking like “chlorine meets TCP”.\u0026nbspBut he admitted: “We don’t know what caused the precise nature of the smell.”Back in the LSE with the laser egg, however, Dr Smith did offer some reassuring context – about both the smell and the unhealthy particles.“I wouldn’t want to be too alarmist,” he said.Although that 102 measurement was his laser egg’s highest recording, he has only had it since May.Apart from Wednesday, his laser egg had been recording good air quality of between 10 and 30 on the index all summer, and on Thursday morning it was back down to 25.\u0026nbspAnd, Dr Smith said, the AQI reading of 102 had only just made it into the unhealthy range.\u0026nbsp This categorisation, denoting air quality that may adversely affect people with asthma or other lung conditions, starts at 101.Hundreds of thousands of children dying due to Africa’s poisonous airRestrictions on wood burners planned to improve UK air qualityMan who believes current air quality is ‘too clean’ named to EPA boardAn\u0026nbspindex reading that is unhealthy for the whole population\u0026nbspstarts\u0026nbspat 151, very unhealthy at 201 and “hazardous” is classed as anything from 300 upwards.Dr Smith said: “While researching wildfires in Southeast Asia. I’ve had readings of 2,000 in the smoke.“Cities like Beijing go over 100 frequently.\u0026nbspLondon has had far worse than this over the years, and whatever it was, it’s over now.”“People who live in more industrial parts of the UK, he added, “Are probably accustomed to these kinds of smells all the time, but people in central London are not used to it, because it is a very de-industrialised city.“I think there was probably a little bit of an over-reaction to an industrial smell that might be fairly common elsewhere.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The prisons watchdog flagged up the impact of the remote-controlled flying devices at HMP Liverpool. “Common sense suggests the cuts in prison staff numbers had something to do with the rise in the number of deaths but when we looked in detail it wasn’t as simple as that.\u0026nbsp“There was a rise in self-inflicted deaths across the board, including in high-security prisons protected from the cuts.”She warned that there had also been a “marked increase” in inmates cutting and scratching themselves, as well as attempted hangings, overdoses and self-strangulation.The report found that murders had almost doubled from four to seven in the year, and that “extreme violence” was spreading from high-security prisons to low-security establishments that only hold inmates deemed no longer to be violent.In one category C resettlement prison, a 25-year-old man jailed for drug dealing was stabbed to death over a mobile phone on his way to Friday prayers.\u0026nbspThe report said levels of violence were at an all-time high in an “increasingly volatile and violent environment” worsened by falling prison staff numbers and the rise of psychoactive substances.Ms Moody said the watchdog was also seeing the “completely unexplained deaths of young men who seem to be well and then die unexpectedly”, sometimes without a cause ever being established.“Anecdotal evidence suggests that they are using psychoactive substances,” she added.\u0026nbsp“Often prison officers tell us they had no idea they were using but prisoners say they were using every day and regularly seen under the influence.”Ms Moody said former legal highs like spice\u0026nbspare now “completely out of control” in Britain’s prisons and remain readily available despite government attempts at a crackdown.“Inidual prisons are really struggling to do what they can,” the ombudsman added. “There needs to be a national drugs strategy which deals with supply and demand and provides advice on what works to prisons.”She said inidual institutions were implementing their own testing and procedures, although some do not have money to buy expensive equipment.Some prisoners died of natural causes and the ombudsman warned that not all were being afforded dignity, with some being kept in handcuffs or chained to prison staff until shortly before their deaths.The report found that both health and mental care was lacking in some institutions and Ms Moody said the death that shocked her the most was that of a teenager suffering from undiagnosed meningitis.The 19-year-old, known as Mr K, was referred to the mental health team but underwent no physical checks, and his erratic actions\u0026nbspwere\u0026nbsptreated as “poor behaviour” rather than a sign of illness.\u0026nbsp“Over the course of the next three weeks Mr K stopped eating, drinking and communicating,” the report said. “His condition deteriorated severely to the extent that he repeatedly soiled himself and ate his own faeces … staff did not refer him to the prison GP for two weeks, and when they did Mr K refused to attend the appointments.”A week before his death, Mr K collapsed in the shower and was taken to hospital in restraints.\u0026nbspHe was placed in an induced coma and died six days later of meningitis, bacterial endocarditis (an infection of the heart) and pneumonia.In 2017-18 the PPO investigated 180 deaths from natural causes, 74 suicides, seven murders, 23 “non-natural deaths” and 71 allegations of staff using unnecessary force.Mark Day, of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “This disturbing report paints a bleak picture of a prison system where people are dying needlessly, and where lessons clearly set out by the ombudsman are not being learned.”A prison service spokesperson said: “The best way to keep staff and inmates safe is to keep drugs out of prisons. That is why we are spending an extra £40 million on safety and security measures including x-ray scanners, drug-detection dogs, better perimeter searches and phone-blocking technology.“In addition, we’re tackling the criminal gangs that smuggle drugs into prisons by investing an additional £14m each year to cut off their ability to do business.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s not her fault universal credit was designed so that no one would be worse off,” the Plymouth MP tweeted.“Stop the tax-free allowance rise and reinvest into UC, or I can’t support it. Not politically deliverable in Plymouth I’m afraid.”Jeremy Corbyn seized on the admission, tweeting: “Nobody should be worse off, and nobody should have their homes put at risk because of universal credit. The system has to change.And Steve Rotherham, the Labour mayor of the Liverpool city-region, an area where the beneficial credit is being extended, said: “Finally Esther McVey admits the truth that universal credit is making people worse off.“It is a national scandal that she has known this all along and still pushed ahead regardless of the damage it is doing to the most vulnerable.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Anyone could do anything if this becomes the norm\u0027Click to followThe IndependentAbdul-Rahman Ayyash had gone abroad to to help Syrians escaping that country’s war, planning to return home soon\u0026nbspto Egypt and his family. But then Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi\u0026nbsptightened his hold on the country, killing hundreds of anti-government protesters on the streets, and jailing many of Mr Ayyash’s friends. A two-week trip turned into five often painful years of exile. The 28-year-old missed out on his sister’s marriage, his niece’s birth, his father’s long illness, and days spent with his childhood friends in his home town, the Nile Delta city of Mansoura. He eked out a living as a journalist and researcher in Istanbul, gaining a name for himself as a thoughtful critic of Mr Sisi’s human rights violations and corruption. Now, following what is widely feared to be the brutal assassination in Istanbul of a leading Saudi exile journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mr Ayyash again fears for his safety. “When I think about Jamal, he was doing exactly what I’m doing —\u0026nbsptravelling around to conferences, writing in Arabic and English,” said Mr Ayyash. He\u0026nbspmet repeatedly with Mr Khashoggi, who is missing and feared dead following a 2 October visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. “For everyone in my circle, Jamal’s case is the only thing we are talking about,” he said. “The worst thing we thought might happen is we would go into our embassy or consulate, and they would harass us somehow, maybe take our passports. Our imagination never reached the\u0026nbsppoint that we could be abducted and killed in our own embassy.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi’s disappearance -- possibly at the hands of a 15-member team that arrived in Istanbul from Riyadh shortly before his disappearance and headed abroad quickly afterward\u0026nbsp—\u0026nbsphas terrified and traumatised many other Middle East activists, journalists, dissidents, and scholars who were forced to flee their countries. “We’re all a target now,” said Joseph Bahout, a French-Lebanese scholar who is often critical of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad. He spoke from Beirut,\u0026nbspwhere he frequently travels and which remains an area contested by allies of\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia and its rival Iran. “If this goes unpunished, it means that every tyrant in this bloody region has a licence to kill his opponents anywhere and everywhere. Anyone could do anything if this becomes the norm.”Unnamed Turkish and US\u0026nbspofficials have described Mr\u0026nbspKhashoggi’s disappearance as a probable\u0026nbspassassination. It wouldn\u0027t be\u0026nbspthe first such incident in a\u0026nbspregion rife with armed conflict, bombings, and clandestine shadow wars. Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein had few compunctions about gunning down outspoken critics abroad. Iran appears to have begun to ramp up a decades-old practice of assassinating dissidents in exile. An Iranian activist in the The Hague and an Iranian-British satellite television executive in Istanbul were among those shot dead under unexplained circumstances over the last couple of years. Salman\u0026nbspwith Donald Trump in Washington this year (Reuters)But those counties all acquired pariah status, whilst oil-rich Saudi Arabia remains a member of the international community in good standing. Next week, US\u0026nbsptreasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and the CEOs of JP Morgan Chase and Uber are scheduled to attend a forum in Saudi Arabia hosted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has been accused by US\u0026nbspintelligence officials of ordering Mr Khashoggi\u0027s abduction. Saudi Arabia has also repeatedly abducted dissident members of the royal family, dragging them back to the kingdom against their will.\u0026nbspSaudi officials insist Mr Khashoggi\u0026nbspleft the embassy shortly after he arrived, a narrative contradicted by reams of security camera footage leaked by Turkish officials to local and international media.\u0026nbsp“Gaddafi used to do such things and paid a high price,” said Yahia Assiri, a Saudi dissident in London, and a good friend of Mr Khashoggi. “If this things goes and Saudi doesn’t pay a price, so many countries around the world will copy this. It it will become a precedent.”He added: “The very important thing is that those dictators are copying each other. They learn from each other.”Mr Khashoggi, at one point a Saudi insider, fled his country for the US\u0026nbsplast year. He\u0026nbspbegan to carve out a career for himself as a writer and commentator, critical of the\u0026nbsprise of Crown Prince Mohammed. Since coming to power and serving as the de factor ruler of the country under his father, King Salman, the\u0026nbspSaudi crown prince\u0026nbsphas launched a series of economic and social reforms lauded by the West. But he has also jailed dissidents of all stripes, and occasionally targeted\u0026nbspoutspoken critics abroad.\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi\u0026nbspwent to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain paperwork to settle personal matters, a run-of-the-mill procedure for many people living abroad including expatriates, refugees and migrant labourers who must seek consular assistance\u0026nbspfor renewing passports, registering births, certifying marriages, and completing university applications. Mr Ayyash said he had no fears when he last visited the Egyptian consulate in Istanbul four years ago, but will think twice if he must go\u0026nbspagain now. He noted that Mr Khashoggi maintained cordial ties with Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to Washington and brother of the Crown Prince, a relationship that apparently offered him no protection. ”It’s a very grave situation, if it could happen in a consulate,” said Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party and a friend of Mr Khashoggi.

The Saudi leadership is clearly rattled by the international reaction to the alleged abduction, which it strenuously denies. But\u0026nbspas one of the world’s top\u0026nbspoil exporters and arms importers,\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia is also in a unique geopolitical position.“It increases the incentives and desires for crazed, power-obsessed rules-free people like Sisi to think they can get away with it,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director of Human Rights Watch. “But nobody but Saudi has the carte blanche.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Heres what you need to know.Marijuana, or cannabis, is the most consumed illegal drug in the UK.It is commonly ingested by smoking but for medical purposes it can also be taken in oil or pill form.Low concentration versions of cannabis oil are widely available in British pharmacies.Makers say it can be used to help promote sleep, boost appetite and reduce stress, anxiety and depression.Higher concentration forms of cannabis oil have been hailed for treating the symptoms of epilepsy, HIV and cancer.But cannabis oil with more than . per cent THC- the psychoactive element - is banned in the UK despite high-profile cases like Billy Caldwell.The -year-old was given a -day exemption to take higher strength cannabis oil to treat his severe epilepsy.In July  the governments Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said the rules should be changed so doctors have the option of prescribing cannabis-derived products for certain ailments.It also recommended clinical trials to assess the safety and effectiveness of such products.It will be soon, yes.Medicinal marijuana will become available on prescription within the coming weeks after Home Office Secretary Sajid Javid agreed to relax drug laws.Medicinal cannabis will be available on prescription from next month, the Home Secretary announced today.Doctors will be able to prescribe cannabis products to patients from November .The new rules apply to England, Wales and Scotland, Sajid Javid said in a written statement.It follows several high-profile cases, including young epilepsy sufferers Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell, whose conditions appeared to be helped by cannabis oil.In order for a cannabis product to be considered medicinal it must meet three requirements: it needs to be a preparation or product which contains cannabis, cannabis resin, cannabinol or a cannabinol derivative it is produced for medicinal use in humans and is a medicinal product, or a substance or preparation for use as an ingredient of, or in the production of an ingredient of, a medicinal product, according to Mr Javids statement.Sativex is one of a very few drugs containing cannabis-derived THC and CBD  - another less potent ingredient - that can be prescribed on the NHS.It is used to relieve the pain of muscle spasms for sufferers of multiple sclerosis.Use of Sativex is currently limited to those people who respond to the first four weeks of treatment.However NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, does not recommend its prescription.In a  clinical guideline update, NICE said: The guidance does not recommend the use of the cannabinoid drug Sativex or fampridine as they provide only a modest benefit at a signicant cost to the NHS.Sativex costs £, per quality-adjusted le year , while fampridine costs in the region of £, per QALY.Both are well above NICE’s threshold of £, per QALY."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000433197202.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jean claude juncker everything wrong with eu","story":"He is everything that’s wrong with the European project — and why it’s so vital that we leave.In his latest rant, he demanded “respect” and delivered a warning that “Press freedom has its limits”.

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed. So let’s build more by building smarter, and give a new generation the chance to buy a home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest will be Brits who could claim more for child benefit, housing benefit, income support, jobseekers allowance or ESA.Those who are already on Universal Credit at the moment are only new claimants and are unlikely to be affected - but those who are claiming benefits on the old system and who will be rolled over soon could get a welcome boost.Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told The Sun Online: Universal Credit is a benefit system designed for the st century, replacing the old out-of-date legacy system.UC will provide more support to the most vulnerable, and helps people claim their right entitlement, helping those who may not be getting the right amount.As people move onto Universal Credit from the old system, there are around £.bn of unclaimed benefits that people will be able to access – benefiting around , people.Dave Finch, Senior Fellow at the Resolution Foundation, said: One of the key remaining advantages of Universal Credit is that by simplying the benefit system it should help families to claim all of what they’re entitled to.This would offer a welcome income boost to over half a million families, but it risks being undermined by problems where – such as the large cuts made to support for working families.The government needs to both highlight the remaining benefits of Universal Credit, and do more to deal with the signicant problems it still faces.Youll have to re-apply for your benefits again, and fill out the relevant paperwork.But after giving the DWP all your information, the new system should automatically pick up whether you are entitled to more benefits.This could include jobseekers allowance, ESA, income support, tax credits, housing benefit or child benefits.Universal Credit will roll all of these into one new monthly payment.Its thought that around , Brits will benefit from it.Roll-out of the Governments flagship welfare reform programme is expected to take place in  job centres.By , it is expected there will be a full roll out across the UK.For information about whether you can claim, visit Citizens Advice.The news will be a boost for some of the millions of people who are set to migrate over to the new system, which aims to roll several benefits into one monthly payment.But the flagship programme has been beset with issues so far, even though only a small number of the population are on it.The system has been plagued with delays and problems, and hundreds of complaints that benefits have been slashed by hundreds of pounds a month.Some were missing out on hundreds due to when their pay date fell.And one family of a boy battling cancer were so poor on Universal Credit they were forced to eat his leftover hospital food.The Sun Online revealed earlier this year the case of a disabled man born with  holes in his heart who has been denied benefits on Universal Credit - and told to get a job.Ministers have insisted that no one will be worse off going on to the new systemtheir situation doesnt change.But they will only be able to access transitional protection payments for a certain amount of time under Universal Credit.The former Tory leader attacked the Governments key welfare reforms today, saying it would lead to deep political trouble.Sir John said he was worried about how fast it was being rolled out and the way thousands were set to be worse off.He told the BBC: I am saying thatyou have people who have that degree of loss, that is not something that the majority of the British population would think of as fair.Andpeople think you have to remove yourself from fairness, then you are in deep political trouble.The poll tax - introduced in the s - proved very unpopular and led to riots and rebellions, and the fall of Margaret Thatchers government.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover it, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Yesterday ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown made a huge intervention in the debate, calling on ministers to halt the rollout.He said that Universal Credit was forcing more kids into poverty, and demanded they rethink the entire system.Ministers say the new programme will make work pay, and will encourage more Brits into work.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stigmatising obesity undermines people’s health and makes it harder to seek support.”The Federation also called on social media companies to clamp down on weight abuse online after a snapshot poll found many social media users were using discriminatory language on sites.The research showed the impact was far reaching and damaged people’s career prospects and could lead to social isolation.Based on an academic study, the report highlighted the common the use of negative images used by media when reporting on obesity.Looking at online media in  countries, outlets in South Africa, Hong Kong and Italy were found to be the most stigmatising, but authors said all the countries examined showed some bias.The report also highlights words and phrases to avoid for the obese including “fatty”, “chubster”, “flabby”, “supersized” and “mammoth”.It said instead people should use the terms “iniduals with a high BMI” and “people living with obesity”.Ms Ralston added: “This World Obesity Day we’re calling on the media to reshape the narrative around obesity and for social media companies to clamp down on weight abuse online.“Changing the narrative around diseases and conditions can transform public perceptions and improve quality of le and outcomes for patients.“As obesity rates continue to rise, we’re also appealing to the medical education authorities and providers to improve specialist education in medical schools, as people with obesity are often dismissed by their healthcare professional because of their weight without being properly diagnosed.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I still can’t believe it.In March last year, a jihadi went on a rampage in Westminster.Then he smashed into the perimeter fence and entered New Palace Yard, a few dozen feet away from where our politicians were gathered.Armed with a kne, he attacked anyone he saw. He murdered PC Keith Palmer.And now the thing that beggars belief. At that very moment, the acting commissioner of the politan Police, Craig Mackey, was leaving the scene in a car. He was inches away from Masood.He was only a few feet away when the Islamic terrorist was busy stabbing his colleague, PC Palmer.He watched the stabbing take place. And what did he do  He drove off, sharpish, having locked the windows of his car.He told an inquest into the murder: “I was in shirt-sleeves with no radio. We had no protective equipment.“The way the male came in, he was clearly a threat.“The attacker had one of those looks where,they get you in that look, they would be after you.”So he skedaddled as fast as he could, actually driving right past Masood.It has a Monty Python ring to it.“When danger reared its ugly head, Sir Craig bravely turned and fled . . .”How, I wondered, could he possibly do that  I thought one of the requirements for being a copper was a certain bravery and, you know, a vague interest in apprehending criminals Also, Masood seemed a bit nasty. He had “one of those looks”.No s**t, Sherlock. This is cowardice and, to my mind, a gross dereliction of duty.At the very least, he could have opened the car door to distract the attacker.Nope, not Sir Craig. If he’d done something — anything — poor PC Palmer might be alive today. Various senior ex-coppers have called for Mackey to be booted out, right now. and stripped of his knighthood.Incidentally, he was bunged the knighthood in this year’s New Year’s honours, partly for hugely reducing the number of stop-and-searches in London. That’s what the lefties wanted at the time.They bleated that stop-and-search was racist. Craig was only too happy to oblige. Oh, the irony of it.It’s thought ending stop-and-search contributed to the jamboree of stabbings we have seen in London this year.You wonder how Mackey has lived with himself these last  months. And how he can possibly retain the respect of his less well-remunerated colleagues.But it tells you a lot about the way our police forces are run these days.Their political grandstanding on “hate-speech” issues.Their reluctance to engage in the dficult, nasty side of policing, such as stopping real villains going about their work.Resign, Sir Craig.At least salvage a little bit of dignity by doing that.She turns them all down because they were too small. Or not in a nice area. We even offered to bung her £, for a deposit on a home.Now the woman has sued her local authority for infringing her human rights.Listen, love, they’re not half as infringed as they would beI had my way.You’d be dropped from a plane into Aleppo . . . and you’d have to crowd-fund the parachute. WIND turbines are a blight on the landscape.They deliver very little energy for their monstrous size. And they act as a kind of huge Moulinex blender for all kinds of wild birds.Now the United Nations’ World Health Organisation has discovered still more flaws in these ludicrous contraptions. They can also cause heart problems, high blood pressure and tinnitus in humans.But because they are beloved by the gobby Green lobby, we’re going to have loads more of them.Marching across the country. Not generating very much electricity.And causing misery wherever they are.APPARENTLY William Shakespeare disliked women because one of them gave him a dose.This is according to a new study by someone who probably hasn’t got a Scooby.The theory is that Will copped syphilis off some unwholesome Tudor bint and this coloured his opinion towards women for ever.“Is this a dagger I see before me ”No, mate.

The moron hordes descended upon Kelly, pictured.They demanded he “educate himself”, saying Churchill was a racist, imperialist murderer. The usual rot.Kelly was forced to apologise, though he should never have done so. Sure, Churchill possessed a few views which today we would find a little, er, problematic. But there wasn’t a single statesman from his era who didn’t – and that includes Gandhi.Churchill saved the world from fascism.Why can’t these cretinous liberals get things in proportion Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet just four years ago the Shadow Chancellor rejoiced that the once-rich South American country was now experiencing “socialism in action”.The warning signs of collapse were already there.

So we never got back to that hospital and cured our baby ourselves.”The “twins” grew up very dferently.Uliyana was tall, blonde and blue eyed.Yana - now a mother of one who lives with Galina - looked like “a little gypsy girl – with dark and adorable big black eyes”.Galina said: “Their characters were totally dferent.“Uliyana was a quiet home girl.“She loved dolls, and played the violin.“Yana was like a little boy – she ran outside, playing with toy cars.”They persuaded themselves that one girl looked more like her mother, the other like her father.“To be honest, from time to time I was anxious about it but I never told anybody,” said Galina.“I did not even allow myself to think that Yana could be someone ’s daughter”.Galina admitted that the truth has been devastating for Yana.Her real mother recently had a double stroke and cannot walk or speak now.“She was so upset,” said the mother who raised her.“We are trying to support her, to spend more time with her.“She is our child she will remain our daughter forever.”Yana said: “My parents held back this truth for a while.“They were not brave enough to disclose it to me, that Uliyana’s real sister has been found.“On the one hand, I was very happy for my sister, but on the other hand I felt so lonely.“We are all friends now.“We often meet and communicate but still I am often very sad.“I have the one and only mother – Galina.“I went to meet my biological brother Dmitry but we did not get on well.”It is believed she has not met her blood mother who is too ill.“I still cannot accept this for now,” said Yana.It turned out that Yana - born a day after the twins - was also sent to hospital after birth due to low weight.She and Ksenia were treated together - without their mothers being allowed to visit because of the flu epidemic.Ksenia told of her miserable home le - a fate that should have been Yana’s.“I lived with my mother just for four years,” she said.“I had a brother.“Then our mother was deprived of her parental rights and I was sent to an orphanage with my brother.“This is where I grew up.“Our mother visited us couple of times - but she was not really interested.“She drank a lot, then she was ill, now she can’t walk, she had a stroke.“Because of doctors’ negligence I grew up in the orphanage.“I did not have a mother, father and sisters.“I dreamed about a family so many times.“I had to survive in the orphanage and it affected my character.”She was not chosen for adoption, she said.The brother raised with her Dmitry - who now cares for their mother - said:  “I remember how they took me and Ksenia away to the orphanage.“We often protected each other there. I think of Ksenia as my real sister”.Now Ksenia is a mother of three, with sons  and , and a daughter, two.Galina said: “We are so worried about Ksenia.“Her childhood was taken away from her.“She did not have parental love, toys and sweets.“We lost the chance to care for her, to give her education.“Who is guilty  We want justice.”This week a Russian court has awarded compensation of £, each to Uliyana, Yana and parents Vladimir and Galina.Ksenia was awarded £,.The baby swap victims had asked for ten times as much and their lawyer Igor Savvin said they are deciding whether to appeal.The case is the latest in a spate of tragic swapped baby stories from the Soviet era that have only come to light with the use of DNA testing years later.Meanwhile a lawyer for the hospital hit out at the scale of the compensation ordered by the court.Evgeny Kozminykh said:  “Usually such multi-million rouble lawsuits are filed when a tragedy took place, when a patient died due to the doctor’s mistake or became disabled.“Here, in my opinion, we see a happy event.“People found each other after so many years.As a lawyer I must say that I do not accept this lawsuit.”There was “no evidence” that the hospital was culpable in swapping the babies, he claimed, criticising the court verdict which held medics to blame.He claimed the maternity hospital could be responsible.“It happened  years ago and it is not possible to establish the truth now,” he said.“Medical documents are stored for  years only.“Everything has been destroyed now.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000440894042.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside americas evangelical purity movement girls pledge virginity to fathers","story":"The movement, started in Colorado Springs  years ago by believer Randy Wilson and his we Lisa, has since spread across  states and  countries.During elaborate annual Purity Balls, daughters pledge to remain virgins until they get married.The formal occasion entails the girls dressing up in long white gowns and the fathers wearing smart suits, attending a dinner and dance in scenes that resemble a wedding.At the ceremony, fathers are given a key, representing their daughters chastity, to eventually pass on to their daughter’s future husband.Both father and daughter then sign a purity contract and the daughters are given a purity ring to wear on their wedding ring finger.In Louisiana, -year-old Hannah Lee Powers attended a Purity Ball with her father.The teen told Barcroft TV: The Bible says that sex before marriage is a sin and I believe that.“I’m doing this Purity Ball because it’s like a symbol to tell everybody. That this is what I am doing and you may not accept it.You may think it’s weird but this is what I want to do because I want to take the stand for what believe.I want to make a promise to myself and to God that I will stay pure until I get married.I don’t have to have sex to know that I am loved.The Purity Movement preaches that sex before marriage is a sin and wards teens off the act with stories about sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy outside wedlock.Organiser of Hannahs purity ball Deb Brittan said: “Safe sex is a total and complete myth. There is no such thing as safe sex. The reason I have genital herpes today is because someone told me there was such a thing as safe sex.”Hannahs decision to make a purity vow has honoured her dad Beauchamp.He said: “Its an honour for someone to say that they are going to waitI believe one thing, she will get rewarded for it. So it is going to be hard. It’s going to be tough and she will be judged and laughed at and hopefully she can take the heat.”Founder of the movement Randy Wilson says that the idea behind the Purity Ball isn’t just about abstinence, but to also help fathers and daughters establish strong relationships.But there has been a backlash from people claiming that the idea behind the movement implies that a woman’s value lies in her virginity and any bad le decision relates to their choice to have sex.Deb, however, believes there is power in submission.She said: I became sexually active at a very young age and I still remember being very disappointed after that first experience and thinking, ‘You gotta be kidding me.’“When I stated to drink or do drugs and make other reckless choices after my choice to become sexually active, that was all connected. Because my devaluing myself and not feeling worthy anymore.And that led me to become a stripper. So I had made one devaluing choice at  to become sexually active. That led to many more devaluing choices.She added: I believe that there is power in submission. And so right now these young girls are voluntarily choosing to be obedient to their fathers. In the same way that I choose to submit to my husband’s leadership.Teenager Hannah admitted to having boyfriends in the past, but she is now going to extreme s to ensure who she is next dating will become her husband.I have set rules for myself, like I promised myself a long time ago that I would not be in a room alone with another guy unless he is family. Because I know that is something that can lead to temptations.I can’t say that I’ve gone all my le without kissing a boy because that would be a lie. Everybody strays from God’s path, butyou’re really willing to turn your le around then God will always forgive you."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000440720765.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"phil jones jonny evans ladybird invasion twitter sti","story":"Manchester United defender Phil Jones and ex-teammate Jonny Evans hired specialists after their WAGs hit out at the infestation on social media.Evanss we Helen tweeted: Anyone  got ladybirds all over their house She added: I’ve got pest control coming tomorrow to get rid of them all!!

They are everywhere!!A third also reported: Hundreds of #adybirds crawling all over the greenstone walls in Shaftesbury today.Harlequin ladybirds, scientic name Harmonia axyridis, are ladybirds that are not native to Britain.Experts have previously said the ladybirds reach Britain by hitching a lt on the warm southerly winds.The foreign creepy-crawlies are said to pose a threat to the domestic species because they carry a sexually-transmitted disease, called Laboulbeniales fungal disease.They are sometimes called the “Halloween ladybird” in the US because of the time of the year they flock.But there are actually , dferent species of ladybirds across the globe, with  dfernet types in the UK.The Harlequin ladybird is one of the newest insects to the block, appearing in Britain in .The beetles were introduced into mainland Europe from Asia, with it hoped they would help to control plant pests.Thriving here, they have even outcompeted some native ladybird species - even known to eat other ladybird larvae.To recognise the Harlequin ladybird from other British species, there are some telltale signs including:- Harlequin ladybirds are generally large, measuring about -mm- Their wing colour can be pale yellow-orange, orange-red, red or black highly iable- The pattern on their backs generally have zero to  orange-red or black spots* According to the Harlequin Ladybird SurveyThe deluge normally comes around this time of year, with a woman filming the insects pelting her countryside home as they sought shelter.Margaret, who lives just outside of Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, said the three-day pelting was like something out of Hitchcocks The Birds.Margaret said: I was lucky I noticed it was happening as they just came out of nowhere and started hitting the window and streaming in.It was a struggle to close the window as I didnt want to squash any of them and by then they were already all over the window frame.Its not the first time the loveliness of ladybirds have swarmed homes.Residents in the town of Lipova, in western Romania, were forced to seal up their homes after the beetles descended in .Locals said they were so many it was like a living carpet, and that they had to shovel them out."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000429099319.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"m26 motorway closed brexit lorry park","story":"Ministers last night snuck out plans to shut down the M in Kent so builders can work on the road.It will be redeveloped to enable it to hold lorries on part or all of the roada No Deal Brexit leads to huge queues at the port of Dover.MPs responded with fury to the news which was slipped out without any explanation.The M, which connects the M around London to the M running towards Dover, was closed at pm last night and reopened at .am.The closures will continue until Monday -

You cant increase the number of properties and so supply and demand dictate the prices.That row of properties is located in the most enviable part of Sandbanks. The houses have direct water access and also overlook the busiest part of the harbour.Sometimes with the bigger, headline-priced properties you need two summers to sell them.So to have two at the very top end of the market go as quickly as they have says an awful lot about the state of the local market.Keith Fensom, from Savills, said: “I think the appeal of that section of Sandbanks is that its very private.“Houses on the beach dont have quite so much privacy because the beach is open to the public, but on the harbour side you dont have anybody in front of you.You can see all the activity in the harbour and you dont get the queue for the ferry outside your house.Sandbanks started to attract global attention in  when its first smallish property sold for £ million – or £ per square foot – putting it fourth in the real estate league after LondonHong Kongand Tokyo .Since then it’s become one of the most expensive and exclusive places to live in the world.“There is also a huge dference in value on the road.

Other factors of concern to investors are the risk of a \"no-deal\" Brexit, signs of a possible clash between the EU and Italy over the latters refusal to set a responsible budget, and the US midterm elections.But the relationship between the US and China is the biggest concern.And, overlaying all that, is the inexorable rise of debt. The International Monetary Funds latest report reveals that global debt stood at tnat the end of , representing a % increase over the past decade.If other economies raise interest rates like the US - or even start to withdraw the fiscal stimuli put in place after the financial crisis - that raises the cost of servicing and ultimately repaying debt for a lot of borrowers. :: Was some kind of sell-off inevitable Absolutely.

Speaking at an Institute for Government event today, the tax chief, said: “We have had to literally change how I travel and what my personal security is. We have had two death threats investigated by the politan Police for speaking truth unto power about Brexit,” he said.  Asked about the impact of the death threats by Civil Service world, he said: “You know you’re in a [signicant] moment because the question is a very powerful one and the answer is very stark,” he said. “The first I knew it was signicant was when my -year-old son text me with, ‘you’re trending on Twitter’. [I thought] oh, is that a good thing  I don’t know.  He went on to say how important it was that the Civil Service give government the best advice regardless of how it might be received. “I didn’t realise it would result in that, but I think it is absolutely incumbent on us to stick to the fundamental principles of the civil service, which is to give ministers the best advice that we can, and in a democracy minsters make the decisions. “If what we are going to do is back away from that, for whatever reason, I don’t think that’s right. For me that is about personal integrity, and sometimes it is really really dficult – and it is tough with ministers – but it is the right thing to do.”  He added that the fact he had revealed the poundbn figure provided a boost to staff in HMRC. “Colleagues at HMRC sit round and watchI’m at a select committee and they give me feedback, which I want to encourage them to do because it is that kind of organisation, but I didn’t realise it had so much resonance in the organisation – that there’s the boss telling it as it is, we know that is true, we have that information and ministers have that information too.” A number  spokeswoman said the threats were very concerning and completely unacceptable.

The Work and Pensions Secretary broke days of silence after ex-PMs Gordon Brown and John Major both compared the six-in-one benefit to the Poll Tax. But her bid to defend the benefit - which rolls out to .million welfare claimants from July  - backfired spectacularly as she repeatedly refused to deny it would cost more than million families pound, a year. She also refused to deny telling her Cabinet colleagues millions of families would lose pound a month. Speaking after the Mirror launched a campaign to halt UC, she openly admitted: Some people will be worse off.  It came on a dramatic day as:Sir John Major warned of the danger UC will be the next Poll Tax UC architect Iain Duncan Smith repeated calls to put poundbn more in Conservative MP Nigel Mills demanded a pause to prevent a fiasco No said it was listening to concerns and refused to rule out providing more help in this months Budget Jeremy Corbyn said the system has to change dramatically MPs summoned a DWP minister to give evidence urgently Our petition to stop the cruelty passed , signaturesMs McVey was interviewed by the BBC five days after it was reported she privately told colleagues millions would lose pound a month. She repeatedly refused to deny making the comments, saying: I won’t say what I said in Cabinet. I had a very open conversation with my colleagues there about how we support people. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Ms McVey claimed everyone agrees on the principle of UC - despite Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying it has got to go. She added claimants would get pound.billion of transitional support. But she admitted: Ive said we made tough decisions. Some people will be worse off. Under the old system, , people didnt get pound a month, so they didnt get the money they were owed. Under the old system, the most vulnerable in society werent getting as much money as were now going to give them.  What weve done is look at the whole benefit system - how do we get people into work, , people every day. Those people will be on less benefit by the sheer nature that theyre now in work. Ms McVey also refused to deny reports by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studiesthat .million households will be entitled to pound, less per year. Labours shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: This exposes Number ’s claim this week that no family will receive less money under Universal Credit as fiction.“The Government must stop the rollout now before millions of families are plunged into poverty and put at risk of homelessness.” Jeremy Corbyn today called for dramatic changes to UC after warning people in the first stage of the rollout - involving more than million claims - had been forced into debt and their homes put at risk.  Labour launched a review last month with the option of scrapping UC - but a party spokesman confirmed yesterday it will be replaced. Speaking during a visit to Bristol, Labours leader said: Three million families are going to be worse off by about pound per week from Universal Credit. So immediately we will say we will stop this process and we would make sure that nobody is worse off under Universal Credit. This morning Sir John Major warned UC could cause the sort of problems that the Conservative Party ran into with the poll tax. The Poll Tax triggered riots and civil disobedience and toppled Margaret Thatcher in  before it was scrapped. Sir John told the BBC he was not specically predicting riots. But he said the Government should rethink its national roll-out. Writing for the Mirror yesterday, Gordon Brown - the architect of Tax Credits which also launched in scandal, but gave a boost to millions - branded UC cruel and vindictive far beyond austerity.  He added: Theresa May says her mission is to address burning injustice. Well the greatest burning injustice of all time is children going to school ill-clad and hungry. It is the poverty of the innocent – of children far too young to know they are not to blame. But the Government have lit the torch of this burning injustice and they have fanned the flames, with their poundbillion of cuts. MPs today summoned a Department for Work and Pensionsminister to give evidence on the July  rollout - BEFORE changes go before Parliament. The Work and Pensions Committee asked Alok Sharma to give evidence urgently about widespread concerns. Downing Street said pound billion worth of transitional protections was being put into the system to help people being moved over. The Prime Ministers official spokesman would not deny the possibility of putting more money into the system at the Budget on October .  Last years Budget saw pound.billion put in - but critics say it was not enough because it has, since its launch in , been bundled up with billions in austerity-driven benefit cuts. The spokesman said: The PM was clear yesterday that we are listening to concerns, that we are taking a test and learn approach to Universal Credit and improving the system as we roll it out. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom doubled down on defending the benefit, insisting it was a simpler system and we are making sure no-one sees a reduction in their benefits. Labour shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz warned the scheme is causing real hurt to people. But Cabinet minister Ms Leadsom replied: I would encourage her not to believe everything she sees in the press.

But the plan was not disclosed to local councillors or MPs until just hours before work began. Tom Tugendhat, whose constituency is affected said: “It’s come to a pretty pass when [an MP] finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding [MPs]” According to Politico the fact the works were related to Brexit was not disclosed by either the Department for Transport or Highways England until Wednesday  There is concern there could be delays at the nearby port of Doverthe UK withdraws from the EU without a deal because of the need for customs checks. Under the plan confirmed by the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, the M motorway will become a holding area for hundreds of lorries to allow traffic to move more freely on other roads. There will be overnight closures on the motorway until Monday and in the run up to Christmas between November  and December  while the work is carried out Diversions will be in place via the M and M.  A plan called Operation Brock will also see traffic able to park on the nearby M. Sections of the M are currently closed under Operation Stack when lorries are forced to queue because of disruption to rail or ferry services, causing chaos for local journeys.  Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, said his community was kept in the dark about the M work after receiving assurances that nothing was planned. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said he did not expect any of the no-deal Brexit contingencies to be required as he believes a deal will be struck with Brussels.  Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat said: Its come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members. The M works started last night. I wrote toin April asking whether or not this would happen. I was assured the works were not planned and only yesterday was it confirmed to me that Highways England had said that is exactly what was planned, despite having told me the reverse a week earlier. He urged Mr Grayling to explain how the planning permission was granted with no consultation.  Mr Grayling said he was happy to meet Mr Tugendhat to discuss the issue, adding: I do not expect any of the contingencies that we have in place for a no-deal Brexit to be needed because Im confident we will reach a sensible agreement. A spokesman for Highways England said: As part of wider resilience planning, Highways England has been asked by the Department for Transport to develop plans to utilise the M to hold heavy goods vehicles, should further capacity be required in the future. We will be undertaking site surveys on the M during October leading to the installation of two gates in the central reservation to support the safe management of freight in the future,needed. Best for Britain supporter and former Transport secretary Andrew Adonis said: Its not April Fools Day, this is actually happening. Local people should have been consulted or even notied but yet the government are just running roughshod over local peoples opinions. All this just puts Britains economy in the slow lane. Our motorway network will grind to a halt as its turned into Britains most expensive Brexit car-park.

He had a lovely we, a garden to tend to and a spot by the river to play his saxophone. But despite being retired Forrest Tucker, , still had work to do. Dressed all in white, he drove fty miles to the Republic Security Bank in Jupiter, pulled out a gun and announced: “Put your money on the counter. All of it.” Tucker was one of the most notorious bank robbers and escape artists of the th century - and determined that his name would go down in history.  He had plenty of money and no need toto his le of crime - but on that job he gathered up more than , and on his way out thanked the bank tellers. Tucker, who had undergone a quadruple by-pass, calmly made his getaway. But the cops were on his tail and stunned to discover that their bank robber was not only a charming grey-haired pensioner, but Forrest Tucker, the legendary stick-up man.  Since the age of , Tucker had committed countless crimes including multiple daring bank robberies and was the greatest escape artist of his generation, breaking out of almost every jail he was incarcerated in. His unprecedented string of heists and escapes confounded the authorities and captured the imagination of the public. And he had managed to keep his le of crime secret from his unsuspecting wives. Now his incredible le story, which was told in an article in the New Yorker , has been made into a Hollywood film, The Old Man and The Gun, starring Robert Redford.Tucker’s le of crime started at the age just . It was spring  and he was jailed for stealing a car “just for the thrill” as he told police. He managed to escape when a jailer removed his chains, but was discovered just days later eating a piece of fruit in an orange grove. From there he was sent to reform school, but again managed flee once again. By the age of  his rap sheet included charges of breaking and entering and simple larceny. Eventually he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to ten years, released at the age of , already a hardened career criminal. But he had charm. Girls flocked around him attracted by his piercing blue eyes and convincing chat. And those who knew him felt Tucker was desperate to show the world that he was somebody. It was only a matter of time before the charismatic felon was going to turn his crimes into a performance by becoming a bank robber. He began to dress in the style of the legendary bank robbers - striped suits and two tone shoes. In September  he strode into a bank in Miami and pulled a gun, getting away with just over ,.  A few days later he went back to the same place and was caught as he tried to crack open a safe on the roadside with a blow torch. But he didn’t care how long he was banged up for - he was an escape artist. In prison he faked stomach cramps and was taken to hospital where they removed his appendix. “A small price to pay,” Tucker later said. In the hospital prison he unpicked his shackles and walked out unnoticed. He headed to Calornia where he carried out a string of robberies and soon found himself a partner in crime, Richard Bellew. The pair of them hit bank after bank and their notoriety grew, with the press billing them as “dramatically attired hold-up artists”. But Tucker’s luck ran out when FBI agents surrounding him as he was retrieving loot from a safety-deposit box in San Francisco. They went to search his apartment and found a young blonde woman who said she had never heard of Forrest Tucker. She was married to a wealthy songwriter and they had a young baby - Richard Bellew. Yet when officers showed her a picture of Tucker he was indeed her husband. Tucker was sent to Alcatraz, and even he the great escape artist thought “the Rock” had him beat. He and a fellow prisoner began plotting their escape, but when their plans were discovered they were sent to the treatment unit. Tucker decided on a dferent scheme. He began deluging the court with appeals against his  year sentence. In November  he was granted an appeal hearing.

State-of-the-art technology such as automatic tills, self-scanning and unmanned service desks are becoming an increasingly common part of consumer le. But research revealed a large percentage of us are scratching our heads at how to use the gadgets - and are even left feeling ‘embarrassed’ when the systems fail. Nearly  per cent of shoppers confessed to feeling confused while using automated services – and  per cent think human staff are more efficient. Despite this,  per cent believe technology WILL continue to replace more and more human staff in the service industry in the not too distant future.  Thomas Dubaere, chief operating officer of AccorHotels UK  Ireland, which commissioned the study to highlight the importance of their From the Heart business philosophy, said: “Technology is transforming the way we live and work - but it can never replace the importance of the human touch. “Business is best when it uses technology to empower staff to go off script, to stop acting like robots and use emotional intelligence to put people, staff and customers, first. “This research reinforces the importance of people in business, particularly hospitality and service industries, and demonstrates why technology should be used to enable honest and thoughtful human interaction, not replace it.  The study also found one in two shoppers have made friends with a member of staff in a restaurant, hotel or shop in the past. And  per cent of Brits would miss customer service assistantsthey were replaced entirely by a technological alternative, such as self-service technology. Seventy four per cent value friendly customer service when staff take the time and effort to engage with them.  Another  per cent said they sometimes feel people who serve them in-store sound too robotic and ‘rehearsed’, and they would instead prefer to receive a service which felt more ‘off script’.The study also revealed  per cent of those surveyed by OnePoll believe their time interacting with humans, be it their friends, colleagues or family, has decreased in the last five years.When staying at a hotel,  per cent want to be greeted by a human member of staff, and only six per cent would prefer the process to be completely automated. And when it comes to popular bugbears when shopping in-store and dealing with staff face-to face,  per cent feel modern shops are understaffed, and  per cent can’t deal with pushy salespeople. Applied futurist Tom Cheesewright said: “Ultimately, luxury is seamless service, however it is delivered. Now and into the future, only humans can complete that seamless experience. “We are uniquely flexible, both physically and cognitively. We can be warm and empathic, picking up on what people need evenit isn’t consciously expressed.  “Until there is an explosion in the capabilities of AI and robotics, humans and machines are likely to exist side-by-side in any service environment. “Part of the joy of travel is interaction with new people. Just as the rise of digital music has been accompanied by a rise in the enjoyment of live music, and more tactile media like vinyl, so the rise of digital interactions in our everyday lives will likely see us value the human moments more. “How will this look in tomorrow’s hotel  In just a few years, most people will likely have an AI-powered personal assistant that knows their preferences in terms of food, lighting, and entertainment, as well as being connected to their calendar applications, communications and social net-works. “A smart assistant could interface with the hotel systems to source a meal for their user without any conscious interaction from the guest beyond a nod of approval for the card transaction. “Humans won’t be needed for the mechanical transactions of checking in, ordering, and taking payments. “But their advice, direction, and warmth will be at a premium.

The entertainment features a fire-breathing pyromaniac, alluring hula hoops, sexy strong men, a drunken wh***, nail-biting acrobatics and a fearsome dominatrix flying high in the Big Top, according to organisers. The Cirque du Vulgar is heading to Yeovil, in Somerset, this October after sweeping through Devon and Cornwall with huge success. The over-s showcase is inspired by all things vulgar, Somerset Live reports . One of the biggest acts involves a Wheel of Death rotating high above the ground.  Acrobats jump and skip over it while fellow performers dance and bang metal chains in the time to music. Spokeswoman for Cirque du Vulgar Rosie Clarke said the performers have thought of everything from upside-down hunks in trunks to mind-bending pole dancing. There will also be champagne on ice and plenty of those trousers which rip off at the Velcro seams.

This year marks  years since the birth of circus arts in the UK, and we wanted to tear up the rule book and create a show which was refreshing, enticing, and aimed at a whole new audience. Another of the high profile acts includes a giant bath tub and a scantily-clad French maid.  The maid emerges from the bath soaking wet, suspended by elastic wrist cords. The act is tipped as a favourite. Another popular performance includes three Vulgarettes performing a teasing topless feather dance. The circus says: Nudity and naughtiness are the order of the day. But there is no excuses for male members of the cast to stay clothed as they will also be bearing all in the name of risqueacute entertainment.

A row of  luxury mansions in Sandbanks, Dorset, are worth a staggering poundmillion. The ft stretch in the peninsula in Poole Harbour looks out on to the busiest part of the worlds second biggest natural harbour. There is also almost total privacy from the road out front while back gardens run down to the waters edge. But the plots are relatively narrow, between ft and ft wide, making it the most expensive piece of coastline in the world in terms of price per square foot.  To highlight the buoyant state of the super-prime level of the Sandbanks market, two ultra-modern properties with indoor swimming pools were recently snapped up in quick time for a combined pound.m. One of those that went for just over poundm was a huge state-of-the-art mansion while the other sold for pound.m even before the sales brochure had come out. Last week another luxury house on a plot of land that Beatles star John Lennon bought for his beloved Aunt Mimi, went up for sale for pound.m. Other properties to have changed hands in recent times include a mock-Tudor mansion that was sold by soccer boss Harry Redknapp to the boss of Topps Tiles.  It sold for pound.m in  but is now said to be valued at poundm after undergoing renovation. And a his and her mansion that has been split in to two homes and lived in by a brother and sister are said to be worth pound. each. Sandbanks, also known as Britains version of Miami Beach, remains hugely popular with London-centric buyers. Local property experts believe the uncertainty over the impact Brexit will have on the London property market is tempting rich buyers to look where. Adrian Dunford, of Sandbanks estate agents Tailor Made, said: We now believe this part of Sandbanks is the most expensive stretch of coastline on the planet in terms of price-per-square foot.  The multi-million pound mansions in Miami and Monte Carlo will be on much bigger plots of land than you get on Sandbanks. The thing about Sandbanks is that it is a peninsula and so we are hemmed in. You cant increase the number of properties and so supply and demand dictate the prices. That row of properties is located in the most enviable part of Sandbanks. The houses have direct water access and also overlook the busiest part of the harbour. The south westerly aspect allows for sensational views to Old Harry Rocks, Poole Harbour, Brownsea Island and the Purbeck Hills. Sometimes with the bigger, headline-priced properties you need two summers to sell them.  So to have two at the very top end of the market go as quickly as they have says an awful lot about the state of the local market. The properties were bought by London-based buyers and that maybe a reflection of what is happening with the Brexit. And Keith Fensom, from Savills, said: Generally the market is dficult because of the uncertainty of Brexit, but that doesnt seem to affect buyers at the super-prime level. Sometimes these houses might come on the market once in a generation and buyers knowthey dont seize their chance they could be waiting years. Some are passed through family trusts and will never come on the market because there are too many beneficiaries to get to agree to sell.  I think the appeal of that section of Sandbanks is that its very private. Houses on the beach dont have quite so much privacy because the beach is open to the public, but on the harbour side you dont have anybody in front of you and you can see all the activity in the harbour and you dont get the queue for the ferry outside your house. There is also a huge dference in value on the road. The opposite side is apartments and townhouses without the view. There arent many roads in the country you can have houses worth poundm on one side of the road and just pound, on the other. I dont think there is anywhere  in the country that compares, I would think its the most expensive coastal road in the country by a long way. The key is, unlike Devon and Cornwall, its close enough to London for people to come for a long weekend. In two hours they can have a complete change in lestyle, thats the attraction.

Bites from  widow spiders can cause flu-like symptoms, swellings or a nasty infectionleft untreated - and could even kill in rare circumstances. Fumigators are currently on site to try and rid the school of the infestation. The schools site manager said: The first one didnt work. I want them to do every classroom.  We will do an inspection tomorrow morning just checkinganythings there. One mum, , whose son attends the school said the local authoritys response was was a bit over the top. She said: I dont want my son to be scared of spiders. Spiders are in the world - we are humans, we live in a world with animals and insects. We need to learn to live alongside each other.  The mum said she was told the school will reopen on Monday. Yesterday, Eastlea Community School in Canning Town was the seventh school to be closed and will remain shut for at least two-and-a-half weeks while pest control experts rid the buildings of the hidden menace. Parents of the students aged between  and  were informed of the venomous spiders in a letter on Monday. But it was reported pupils were encouraged to go into class on Tuesday so they could collect homework. A letter from headteacher Stephen Gillat confirmed the threat of spiders.  It read: Upon Newham environmental health inspecting Eastlea, an infestation of spiders were discovered in and around the perimeter of our buildings. Therefore, I have had to take the dficult decision to close Eastlea Community School to students and staff. We have engaged a company to deal with and eradicate this pest and they will do this as quickly as possible. However, they have estimated that this will take up to three weeks. Others schools across east London were forced to close after spotting  widow spiders. Monega Primary School in Manor Park had closed on Friday due to the arachnid infestation.  While Ellen Wilkinson, Star Primary, Rokeby, and Lister Community School also announced closures. After its closure, Earlham Primary declared itself spider free and has since reopened. A Newham Council spokeswoman said last week the affected schools were being treated and cleared. She said: We are working with them to ensure children continue to get an education while their schools are closed. We are asking all our schools and nurseries to proactively check their premises carefully for these spiders. If they see any signs, then contact environmental health or pest control as well as notying the council.  David Cross, head of Technical Training Academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said the spiders have been around for some time. He said: False Widow Spiders have brown bulbous abdomens with pale markings, and the females can grow up to mm. The spiders will only bite humansthey become frightened, orthey are accidentally provoked or squeezed. Their venom can make children ill, but bites in adults will usually only cause a temporary pain and swelling. The  widow spider was accidentally imported to the UK about  years ago and they are adapting to our temperate climate, with increased sightings across the country. Headteacher Stephen Gillatt at Eastlea Community School has since told : “After careful deliberation, we have decided to close the school due to a spider infestation discovered on the perimeter of our building.  “We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our families, but assure them this action was taken in best interests of the safety of students. “We kept the school open yesterday to give our staff time to set students work for the period they will not attend school, and for our families to make childcare arrangements. “The school is closed from today, Wednesday October th, and is likely to reopen after the half term break on Monday October th. “We have taken steps to ensure the disruption to student learning will be minimal. Year  –  students will be set work through our online portal, the Dynamic Progress Report. “We are currently in the process of finalising space for our Year  students to be taught in other local schools and institutions. Further information will be made available shortly. “Families and students will be able to contact teachers via email throughout the time school is closed. Please check our website regularly for contact details and updates.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first picture hero dog walker","story":"NewsFirst picture of hero dad trampled to death by cows after going back to save elderly dogBrave John McNamara, , had already successfully helped his two other dogs get to safety before ing to rescue the older pet in a field in East Sussex, a pal saysShareCommentsBySophie EvansBerny Torre:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsHero John McNamara, , was trampled to death by a herd of cows \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the first picture of a hero dog walker who was trampled to death by a herd of cows after reportedly going back to save his elderly pet. John McNamara, , is said to have already helped his two other dogs get to safety before ing to rescue the -year-old Golden Retriever. A brave and golden-hearted father, he was tragically found fatally injured in a field near his cottage home in Forest Row, East Sussex, on Monday. His dogs body was also discovered in the field. Although the cause of both deaths has yet to be officially confirmed, it is believed that they were trampled by a herd on the farmland.  One of Johns daughters said he suffered quite a violent death. Tributes are now being paid to the wonderful man, who had volunteered for a local community centre and was very, very much liked. Speaking outside his four-bed detached home, Johns daughter said: We do want to raise concerns to stop things like this happening again because it was quite a violent death which could have easily been avoided. She declined to comment further as she went into the house with her sister. Her pal, Koko Easterbrook, paid tribute to John on Facebook , saying he was one of the most bravest, golden-hearted should I have even known.  Koko wrote: This man in question actually went above and beyond, getting his other two dogs out of harms way before ing to rescue the third who was quite elderly and couldnt get out of the way fast enough. An absolute hero. John, who was retired, was known to many as Johnny Blue owing to his fervent support for Cha Football Club, Kent Live reports. He volunteered in the Forest Row Community Centres kitchen every Thursday. John Grantham, , a retired blacksmith and former farrier for the Horse Artillery, said the father would have known where he was going. He said: Its just unbelievable that something like this could happen and especially for somebody like John who will have known where he was going.  It was his we I knew better because shes an osteopath and she used to treat my we and me. I knew him here and he was a wonderful man, we used to joke together, I used to pull his leg and he would pull mine just as viciously! He had a very good sense of humour, he was just a happy man. He has got children, one daughter whos at home at the moment. He had three dogs. Ive seen his dogs - Ive been to the house. I think they were Labrador type dogs. He added: He knew the area, he would have walked there regularly. I would have thought he would have gone through them before so it seems odd that this should have happened.  The only thing I can think of is something spooked the cattle. Keith Whitlock, a retired academic, also paid tribute to John. He said: He volunteered for the community centre - he had done it for years. He would literally come and take out orders and bring us the food. He was very very much liked. He did an excellent job and I suppose one has to say most of the people who serve were women and because he was the only chap he stood out. Police have said they are not treating the two deaths as suspicious. A Sussex Police spokeswoman said: The bodies of a man and a dog were found in a field on farmland in Priory Row, Forest Row, at .pm on Monday.  The deaths of the -year-old and his dog are not being treated as suspicious . The circumstances are being investigated and the coroners officer is dealing with the deaths. The deaths come two months after -year-old Stephen Sandy was trampled to death by his cattle just a -minute drive away in Groombridge. Government statistics show that nearly  people have died in accidents involving cattle since  - about four a year. The majority of victims are farm workers, but a quarter are unsuspecting members of the public out walking on footpaths.

The material helps the body enter into a thermal comfort zone which may then lead to a more restful sleep, the researchers said.With the body temperature regulated, people can not only fall asleep quicker, but they can also have a longer and better quality kip, a study showed.Researcher Dr Paul Swan, from the University of Sydney, told Sky News : Not so long ago sleeping under wool bedding was the norm, and science is now rediscovering the benefits of sleeping in wool.Maybe it is not a coincidence because wool regulates your body temperature far better, keeping you in what is known as the thermal comfort zone. You therefore not only fall asleep quicker, sleep longer, but also have deeper, better quality sleep.  The researcher identied the importance of getting a good nights sleep on both physical and mental health. The study, in Australia, was carried out using  students and  older participants. Those taking part went to bed in temperatures of around C. Findings, reported in the journal Nature and Science of Sleep, showed that students wearing wool fell asleep four minutes quicker than those dressed in cotton or polyester. And the older participants aged - who were wearing woollen nightwear were even more successful. They managed to sleep up to  minutes quicker.

Mum-of-two Leanne Short was mortied when she looked in the mirror and realised the epic mistake. She was horried to discover her skin had been dyed scarlet after her little girl Rosie, nine, coated her entire face in the long lasting bright red lip stain from Primark. The -year-old says her bathroom looked like a murder scene and she spent hours trying to scrub the red makeup off her face - leaving handprints all over her bath and shower. Rosie had begged Leanne to allow her to give her a pre-Halloween makeover and the the doting mum couldnt resist her daughters pleas.  Cheeky Rosie first intended to transform her mum into a clown - but was so surprised at how well the red paint was working she changed her mind and coloured in her whole face to make her a lobster instead. Leanne suspected something was wrong when her skin started to tingle and burn - and quickly realised the little girls error. Despite Leanne spending hours failing to scrub away the lip stain with water, makeup remover, baking soda and even vinegar, Rosie thought her mums new look was hilarious. But the mix-up meant red-faced Leanne spent two days having to sport her unfortunate new look in public - leaving her feeling like a social leper. Leanne, from Wakefield, Yorkshire, said: It was a genuine mistake - I think.  The other items she used are just sticks of face paint wax and she just picked up the lip stain. She said to me can I decorate you and see what youd look like for Halloween  Weve got some Halloween makeup pens and ious bits and I said yes. It was actually a lipstick Id got in Primark, a red lip stain, and it was in my makeup bag. I dont knowit fell out of my makeup bag into the other stuff but she picked it up. She said oh Ill make you red. She had said she was giving me clown lips to turn me into a clown but then she said Ill do the whole face. I just sat there and she said do a selfie. Shed done it on my lips and I was thinking it was looking terrible because I was in my pyjamas. She was really proud, which is why in the selfies shes got her thumbs up and things. I was just thinking Im glad youre happy. That Halloween stuff just washes off but when it started tingling and burning and thats when I realised it wasnt right. I was just thinking oh no.  I said show me that Halloween stuff youre using. And thats when I realised it was lip stain. When I couldnt get it off and it was burning she was saying oh mum, Im sorry!, but then when I was scrubbing she was wetting herself. She thought it was so funny. She thought it was hilarious. She just said youre going to have to take me to school looking like that, Im so embarrassed. But she did that to me! She thought it was so funny. It took hours and hours to get off. It was in my eyebrow hair, my hairline. It faded on my face after about two days. When I washed it it smudged, so as I washed it off it was on my face and dripped down the skin onto my neck. As I was trying to scrub it off it just ran down my neck and onto my chests. It ran all down my hands. The more I was scrubbing it the worse I was making it. It looked like a murder scene or something because there were just red handprints everywhere. I had to use bleach [on the tiles] to scrub that off because it had all gone into the grouting.  There were handprints on the white bath and on the shower. It spread everywhere. That would have been good for Halloween because it looked like a crime scene. The family love Halloween and have a big party planned featuring a big dinner of gory food and plenty of costumes. But after her ordeal earlier this year Leanne has sworn not to let Rosie come near her with makeup again. Leanne, a stay-at-home-mum, said: This Halloween I will be making sure shes not doing anything on me at all. Ive got an outfit and a dress and Ill paint my face - yes, I will paint my face, not Rosie - with the correct stuff. I had to take her to school so I had to brush my hair down so you couldnt see how red it was in my hair. That was quite bad. When I covered it up with foundation it wasnt as bad on my face but it looked like I had red lines all through my eyebrows and in my hairline and that took five or six days to go. I had to take her to school and pick her up from school and go shopping and do all the normal things I usually do.

Dibsy admits it’s a case of “le or death” after a health scare.  Now he’s embarking on a fitness journey with personal trainer Mike, from Mas Body Gym, who’s chosen to train him for free. “The doctors have said keep going like you are going and you won’t be around for very much longer,” Dibsy told Teesside Live. “I just want to be healthy so I can go out on a run and live my le, go to the Boro match, go out with the lads.” One of the places Dibsy has been known to turn to is his local takeaway. He admits he loves a parmo, but now Mike has produced leaflets discouraging fast food outlets from serving him. They say: “Save Dibsy. Obesity is killing him. Do not serve this man.” Mike explained that the leaflets aren’t about banning his client from takeaways - he will be allowed treats - but more about breaking him out of an addiction to food. “The next six or seven weeks is going to get dficult for Dibsy,” Mike said.  “What I want Dibsy to do is come to me for support and advice - he’s used to turning to takeaways.” He added that the leaflets are purely for takeaway staff and not the general public.

Data scientists pinpointed the B from Cheddar to Ashwick, which meanders through the rolling Mendip Hills as the most pleasant to cruise along. Second is Forres to Alford, in Scotland, a stunning -mile drive through the Cairngorms National Park with the A, from Moffat towards Edinburgh, Scotland, in third. Experts used key criteria to judge roads including scenery, how close they are to points of interest, and which ones offer optimal driving conditions, before announcing their top . They also looked at how many ‘engaging’ corners would be encountered, levels of traffic and sites with low incident reports to compile the detailed list.  The research was created by Volkswagen in collaboration with traffic and navigation app Waze, to support Volkswagen’s ‘GTI Superdrives’ programme within the app. Taking fourth spot is the A, also known as the Black Mountain Road, which takes in the stunning scenery of the Brecon Beacons in Wales. Making up the top five is the A near Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands.  The Hardknott Pass, a winding single track road in the Lake District which is thought to be the steepest road in England, is number nine on the list. The GTI Superdriveswithin Waze lets drivers know when they’re coming close to one of the roads on the list via a GTI badge popping up when the app is active. If they are within  miles of a GTI Superdrive road, motorists are able to tap on the badge to receive directions to it.  Alison Jones, Director of Volkswagen UK, said: “Our GTI badge quite simply stands for driving joy. “Working with Waze, we wanted to offer more drivers the chance to get off the often congested ‘beaten track’ and instead experience the simple pleasure of driving once more. “The aim, very clearly, is about enjoying time behind the wheel – not speeding or driving in a way that increases risk – and we believe that the intelligence of the Waze app helps drivers do just that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"you struggle predict age looking","story":"NewsWhy you struggle to predict age by looking at a persons online dating photoFour in  said they find it “very dficult” to correctly predict someone’s age by looking at a photo of themShareCommentsByLewis Oakley:,  OCT NewsPredicting ages when online dating can be tricky \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAge may just be a number – but in the world of online dating it’s something that millions of Brits get WRONG, according to research. Four in  said they find it “very dficult” to correctly predict someone’s age by looking at a photo of them. And when it comes to celebrities, people were way off in their age estimates, according to a poll of , UK adults by Lumen, the first app-only dating  for over-s. Sixty per cent of people thought -year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star Johnny Depp was under , and  per cent thought Tom Cruise, , had yet to reach the big . And one in  thought Avengers star Chris Hemsworth was OVER  – when his actual age is .  Charly Lester, co-founder of Lumen, conducted the survey as part of its ‘anti-ageism’ mission to end the misperceptions associated with this group. And the issue isn’t just identying film stars, Lumen found that in tests conducted by the app, many people associate images of people in their sixties and seventies as being in their fties. Lumen uses a unique algorithm to assess the selfie image and authenticate against the other images provided as well as highlight the likely age of the person. Charly Lester added: “Our aim is to shine a light on images and realities that truly reflect today’s over fties, not just a Hollywood version of them. “It isn’t easy to age someone based on their picture, especially as the entertainment industry constantly uses older men to play younger roles.” She said there is a deeper issue with current portrayals of over-s missing the mark, with stereotyped stock imagery and misleading language failing to capture the fun and adventure of being single and over . Just one in five of those aged  and above believe brands’ representations of their age group are accurate, according to the research.

Boston Pizza has created a clever invention that will help make the experience a whole lot easier. Its a pizza box that turns into a handy cardboard food tray for you to eat your slices off in bed - brilliant.  Its cleverly designed to hold up the pizza, allowing room for your legs to fit through the middle. The Canadian pizza joint teamed up with an advertising company to design the genius invention that you never knew you needed in your le. Its a simple idea, but a lot of thinking went into making sure it would actually work,” said Paul Little, creative director at John St ad agency, in a press release. There were a lot of factors to consider. It had to be high enough to fit over a person’s legs and low enough to comfortably eat out of.  We had to compensate for the average depth someone sinks into a bed versus the average leg width, average pizza weight, the list goes on and on. It sounds ridiculous, but knowing some lucky people are going to be able to comfortably eat pizza in bed makes it all worth it. The box comes with instructions to assemble, so it shouldnt be too tricky to put together. Sadly, the smart invention isnt available in the UK at present soyoure dead set on eating your pizza in bed then you better invest in a regular food tray. Hopefully some UK pizza outlets will follow suit...

But others commented that the professional pilots were unlikely to put themselves or the public in danger.  Unless both pilots had a synchronised heart attack or catastrophic plane failure, nobody was in any danger, one said. The Royal Australian Air Force has been approached for comment.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked.

It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"entertainment-in-the-dock-at-scotts-selkirk","story":"SELKIRK is set for a treble turn of tourist delights this weekend.Not only is the hugely popular Scotts Selkirk ing to the Royal Burgh on Saturday, but the town will also host the foot-tapping delights of the Selkirk Sessions as well as the new monthly Farmers Market.The busy weekend comes just as the new-look Market Place refurbishments are completed.Viv Ross from Scotts Selkirk told us: \"A busy weekend is in store ndash with something for everyone.\"We look forward to welcoming everyone to our annual celebrations.\"Dozens of Souters will turn back the clock to relive the days of Scott.As well as re-enactments, period costumes and fayre from centuries gone, there will be plenty of street entertainment throughout Scotts Selkirk.Meg Dodsrsquo ever-popular Kitchen has been relocated to the High Street.The music and puppets of Crafty Beggars will share the town centre with Les Amies drsquoOnos Billy Bowler the Performing Goat.And there will be plenty Victorian childrenrsquos games, including Splat the Rat and a coconut shy, to keep the youngsters entertained.Matthew Burgess has taken over the role of Town Cryer from his late father Bob.And he will be accompanied by young drummer boys Hamish and Cameron throughout his duties.George Renton will ride into town with his penny-farthing.And this year there will also be a Scottrsquos Selkirk shop window treasure hunt ndash with forms available from the Scottrsquos Selkirk Shop.This year Sir Walter Scott will be presiding over The Tall Tale of the Tushielaw Trout, and the Lady Varnishes in his Courtroom.Down below the Courthouse Gael Force, Carlenjig, The Bogie Close Stompers, Highline Fiddlers, Bob Liddle and the Riddell Fiddles will all adorn the stage at some point during the packed programme.Viv added: \"We are really looking forward to the open mic sessions where we will no doubt be treated to some exceptional music.\"There will also be a host of talented buskers in both the Market Place and the High Street to add to the entertainment.\"As well as Scotts Selkirk, the Farmers Market will operate on Saturday and throughout the weekend -

central belt and Strathclyde.And new electric trains with more seats are being introduced to lines around Falkirk, Dunblane, Alloa and Edinburgh.There will also be additional trains across the central

made on the Borders Railway since it opened in .The popularity of the -mile stretch of track is showing no signs of slowing down either with year on year increases.But there are regular complaints from passengers about standing-room only carriages for much of the journey.ScotRail announced last year that new Class  trains would be brought onto the Borders Railway - allowing for additional carriages to be added.Although not included in this weeks announcement, a spokesman has confirmed the new engines are still earmarked for Tweedbank.And they believe the improved timetable for the rest of Scotland will have a positive impact for local commuters.A ScotRail Alliance spokesperson said: ldquoThe introduction of our new trains and the electrication of the central belt will allow us to make best use of our existing fleet and make positive timetable changes in the Borders.ldquoNext year, we will begin to redeploy our existing class  trains to Fe and the Borders.\"These trains will add more than , extra seats each day.ScotRails improved timetable will come into force on December .Managing director Alex Hynes made the announcement this week.He said: \"The improvements we are making to our timetable from December mean ScotRail has reached another milestone as we build the best railway Scotland has ever had.\"This is just the first phase of the work we are doing to deliver

and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere.

Itrsquos an agenda that so far neither the SNP nor the Tories have shown any interest in but Greens will continue to push forward.Scottish Fishermanrsquos Federation chief executive Bertie Armstrong said: ldquoOnce again, Greenpeace is guilty of painting a completely  picture of the UK fishing industry to match its particular prejudices.ldquoSustainability has for many years been the number one priority for the industry, and many sacrices have been made to reach the present position where for key stocks catches are at record or near record high levels while pressure on those stocks from fishing vessels is at a record low, as testied by recent academic study.ldquoStudies also show that for pelagic species large vessels which require massive capital investment are signicantly more environmentally friendly than a fleet of smaller vessels, not to mention safer in wild offshore winter seas where and when much of the catching of this type takes place.ldquoThe only thing that has eroded our coastal communities is a blatantly inequitable EU Common Fisheries Policy which awards other fishing nations  per cent of our fish stocks.ldquoInstead of focusing on the events of well over a decade ago to carry out a hatchet job, Greenpeace should be crediting the industry for its forward thinking approach."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-theresa-mays-end-to-austerity-pledge-big-tory-con-if-public-sector-spending-not-increased","story":"The Labour leader eschewed the subject of Brexit and concentrated his fire at PMQs on austerity, pressing the Prime Minister on how she planned to end the funding squeeze on the police, the NHS, schools, councils and disabled people following her unexpected party conference vow.But Mrs May hit back, claiming Labours plans would cost people pound trillion and, after all the countryrsquos hard work, thrust it back to square one.She repeated her pledge to end austerity and told MPs: \"What is not being brought to an end is fiscal responsibility.\"During sharp exchanges and after the PM raised her Governmentrsquos actions on tackling the issue of mental health, Mr Corbyn pointed to cuts to mental health budgets, the police and other areas as he asked when would austerity finally be over.\"Today there are , fewer mental health nurses than there were in .

The huge sums have been made by large-scale fishermen, with five wealthy families controlling one-third of Scotlandrsquos total quota, despite the entire pelagic fleet consisting of just  vessels.But for those outside the big companies, fishing is becoming a less and less profitable pursuit due to a quota system that favours larger enterprises over small vessels.A study by Greenpeacersquos investigative unit claims to reveal a vastly unequal system where a minority of wealthy families control huge swathes of fishing rights to the detriment of local fishermen.In desperation, many small scale fishermen resort to contacting larger outfits, or those they know have Fixed Quota Allocationsthat they do not fish. Those owners can set their own prices and lease out quota, allowing the fisherman to catch more.The prices set for leasing out FQA can y by hundreds of pounds. To lease a tonne of cod for example, can cost from pound to pound. The resulting catch might bring just pound, at market, meaning a profit margin of pound before staff and equipment costs.According to Greenpeace, the situation has left some fishermen going out on boats alone because they cannot afford to pay a crew, while others have found that, after boat costs, they are still losing money and have stopped fishing altogether.Jerry Percy, founder of the Under Ten Fishermenrsquos Association, which represents small scale fishermen, said: ldquoThe fish in our seas are a public resource, itrsquos yours and mine, managed by Government on our behalf. They should therefore never be treated as just another commodity, to be bought and sold to the highest bidder.ldquoThe hoarding of quota risks creating a distorted market in which the price of fish stocks, and access to them, is controlled by just a few companies.The problem, say critics, dates back to the s when economists argued that the problem of diminishing fish stocks brought about by fleet expansion and mass industrialisation should be solved by the market. They proposed that states create a limited right to catch fish that could be bought and sold.Iceland was one of the first countries to implement this market-based policy in the Eighties. Their fish stocks began to recover and the fishing fleet grew more profitable. But the privatisation of once common fishing-rights led to many fishermen becoming dispossessed as banks started trading in fishing rights and the system eventually crashed.In the UK, the price of large fishing boats and their associated right-to-fish has rocketed, which has led to many young people being priced out. In many cases only large companies with the backing of banks can buy boats.Greenpeace hope the UK can succeed where Iceland failed, and rein in the market to create a fairer system.Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: ldquoHow long before the Government stops blaming other countries, looks at its own broken system, accepts responsibility for fixing it and creates a fairer and more sustainable distribution of fishing quota across the UK  With the Fisheries Bill rumoured to be just weeks away, there has never been a better opportunity to do just this.A spokesman for Lunar Fishing said: ldquoThe quota available to the inshore fleetis more than the under-m fleet can catch, so there is no merit in the suggestion that there is disadvantage to the lsquosmall-scale fishermenrsquo.ldquoIn fact the vast majority of fish caught requires larger vessels to catch because of location, depth and weather challenges. It would be impossible for the inshore fleet to catch a small percentage of the quota.ldquoIn relation to workforce, Lunar uses the quota to employ around  people in the local communities of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Aberdeen. Many more are employed in providing services to the company.A spokesman for Sir Ian Woodrsquos fishing arm, the Don Fishing Co and JW Holdings, said: ldquoBoth come from strong fish catching backgrounds with Sir Ian Woodrsquos father, grandfather and great grandfather all being fishermen. The Don operates as a management and fish selling company working on behalf of about  vessels in which it has mainly minority shares and another  vessels which it helps manage and sell the fish. The Don Corsquos one and only reason for owning some quota itself and helping a large number of fishing vessels to buy their own quota is to enable the vessels to have sufficient quota to be viable.A spokesman for Andrew Marr International said: ldquoAMI fully supports robust fishery management including full compliance to protect fish stocks and sustainable fishing. AMI has  vessels in the English Fully Documented Fishery Scheme with on board camera monitoring.ldquoThe main stocks that AMI fishes for in the North Sea are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, monkfish. In these species, the Under  fleet have excess quota that they have not used in the last several years.A spokesman for Interfish said: ldquoAcross our fleet we were the first UK fleet to achieve full certication against the Responsible Fishing Scheme in  and maintained this against the new standard in  ndash no other fleet of skippers have achieved this standard.ldquoInterfish are active within several MSC client groups enabling sustainable certication of offshore and inshore fisheries."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-can-the-new-bbc-scotland-channel-make-scotland-happy","story":"What you do therefore is grab your audience where you can, when you can.

Plagues of biblical proportion could rain down on our world, but it wouldnrsquot matter so long as Bodyguard or Bake Off were on the telly.So how do you try to create a new channel with enough ied, colourful content to cut across the demographic  At BBC HQ in Glasgowrsquos Pacic Quay, yesterday, plans for the new BBC Scotland digital channel were unveiled to the world, or rather fed up to the press in bite-sized pieces along with sticky buns and coffee.How did it look  Well, letrsquos consider this first we Scots demanded this channel come into being. Or rather we would have had we realised it might actually be delivered. What we have screamed out for these past years is a Scottish Six news programme and what happened is the BBC has wrapped a tartan scarf around the loudest mouths in Natland by offering a whole new channel. We wanted tea and scones. Wersquove got a full three courses. But are we going to enjoy whatrsquos on offer Initial signs are positive. Steve Carson is the man charged with BBC Scotland output, as Head of Multi Commissioning. His television CV suggests hersquos -years -old. . Which all looks great.And he says all the right things. ldquoThe plan for the new channel is to reflect Scotland right back at itself. Now, thatrsquos a toughie, Steve, because Scotland has a history of covering up one eye while looking in the mirror. And the one open eye is a little bloodshot and blurry.We love to see ourselves as a fun-loving, happy collective. The reality is Scotland is ided on so many levels how it sees its future, the importance it places on its past. Scotlandrsquos class ide isnrsquot quite the size of the Nevis range, but itrsquos vast. We live in a little tribal country thatrsquos so often sectarian and loves to get upset with itself. And there are large sections of Scotland which have loved being upset with the BBC.So what are Carson and co going to offer to keep as many of us as possible away from the competition  How is he going to entertain during the five hours of telly a night, from -pm  The five hours will feature a mix of documentaries, factual entertainment programming, comedy, drama and sport. Sounds smashing. The new station will be multi- ndash connected to iPlayer, Radio Scotland, social media and other services. More than  production companies will deliver content. But what sort of content  Much of the target audience will be -, which represents a real challenge. How do you entice young people away from Netflix, YouTubing, wearing their thumbs out on their phones  Well, according to Carsons crew, programmes fronted by the likes of rapper writer Darren McGarvey could make a real mark, his political voice offering up an alternative tour of Scotland.The very funny Grado will front a quiz show and the Peoplersquos News will take in the publicrsquos filmed response to news and topical events. Therersquos also Meet Jamie Genevieve, featuring the YouTube ldquobeauty guru . Given the taster we watched it seems your Auntie Cissie in Kilsyth will find shows such as this a less natural fit than she would a nose ring and ripped jeans.Yet, the new channel isnrsquot ignoring those who prefer TV to be about people rather than what people put on their faces. Documentaries planned include Last Breath, which features the tale of the North Sea er stranded on the seabed with only five minutes of oxygen left. The agedwill sink into this human drama, which incorporates actual footage with the drama.Yes, BBC Scotland would be mad not to spread bet its poundm budget. Thatrsquos why the new channel will let you see River City and Scot Squad before it appears on big BBC.And of course, therersquos the much-demanded news programme. It wonrsquot go out at six, but at nine. And it will have a ldquonew fresh format, although detail of that is to be announced. What we do know however it that it will run for an hour, fronted by Martin Geissler and Rebecca Curran. I donrsquot know Rebecca Curran but Martin Guissler is smarter than a schoolboy at the start of a new term. It sounds exciting.There are also plans under way to broadcast from Scottish theatres, which hasnrsquot been done since . And sport will be covered with discussion forums. But herersquos a little mump wouldnrsquot the new channel be the perfect  for an arts programme, discussing that weekrsquos hi-brow less hi-brow output in Scotland  It could be lively and fun.The world of Scottish theatre alone offers up regular opportunity for strong opinion .It will certainly be fascinating to seeBBC Scotland can get close to its hoped-for  per cent share, to broadcast to as wide as possible demographic, to capture zeitgeist, to reflect Scotland right back at itself, in the way that STV did in  or Radio Clyde in .Interestingly, Gradorsquos Test Drive could be a metaphor for the new channel a car-driving couple progress to their destinationthey answer a series of questions correctly pitched at them by the sat nav.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Thursday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The UK Space Agency said it would pave the way for spaceflights.American aerospace giant Lockheed Martin has won two grants totalling £.million for the scheme.But a new report has warned that Sweden and Norway are pushing on with a rival launch site in Kiruna, Lapland.: Scottish couple killed during flash floods in MajorcaThe UK Space Agency believes European competition would hamper the success of any Scotland becoming a world leader in satellite launches.The research, commissioned by the UK Space Agency from business consulting firm Frost  Sullivan, makes it clear the success of either spaceport is will depend on how quickly it can be set up.The report said: “There is strong support for the argument that the UK must be first to market to ensure the long-term success of the UK launch programme.“The market is forming and there is an opportunity to be ‘disruptive’, there is a short-term opportunity to create market demand by developing a commercial spaceport. Spaceports need to be commercially focused and low cost.”: Dog found dead in Forth and Clyde canal was tied to rockThe report concluded that “first-mover advantage” will be important particularly because there will be very few European spaceports in operation.The UK currently produces a quarter of all the world’s telecommunications satellites and the report said a domestic spaceport could cement the country’s position as a world leader.A UK Space Agency spokesman said: “As part of the government’s Industrial Strategy, the LaunchUK programme aims to develop the first ever space port in Britain and the first on mainland Europe.“The demand for small satellite launch is forecast to increase rapidly over the next decade, and commercial providers believe it is important to move quickly to meet this demand.”Earlier this year Highlands and Islands Enterprise was awarded £.million from the UK government to develop the spaceport in Sutherland. It could be operations in five years.Sutherland was the first vertical launch site to be awarded grant cash, ahead of others at Unst, Shetland and North Uist.The space agency has said the spaceflight market is potentially worth £. billion to the UK economy over the next decade.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4813166.1539183925!/image/image.jpg","title":"utility giant sse cleared for tie up with npower","story":"Britain#s Big Six energy suppliers are about to become the Big Five after a deal to merge Perth-based SSE and Npower#s retail operations was given the all-clear by competition officials.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid its decision to give final clearance to the tie-up came after a probe concluded households will still have “plenty of choice” on standard iable tarfs .It found the two providers are “not close rivals” on the tarfs – the most expensive deals that had been an area of particular concern for the regulator. A provisional thumbs up had been given by the CMA at the end of August.SSE welcomed the decision to give the merger the green light, which will create the UK’s second biggest energy supplier after British Scottish Gas.Under the deal, the new company will be listed on the London Stock Exchange with SSE shareholders holding . per cent and Npower owner Innogy holding . per cent. The merged group will serve some . million customers.Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, said: “This is a complex transaction and there is still much work to do in the coming weeks and months.“However, we’ve always believed that the creation of a new, independent energy and services retailer has potential to deliver real benefits for customers and the market as a whole and it is good to see that the CMA has cleared the transaction following what was a comprehensive and rigorous inquiry.”The CMA had launched a full inquiry into the merger after its initial investigation found that the tie-up could reduce competition, potentially leading to higher prices for households.The regulator added that the incoming UK government-enforced price cap would also help protect customers on iable deals. Anne Lambert, chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: “With many energy companies out there, people switching away from expensive standard iable tarfs will still have plenty of choice when they shop around after this merger.“But we know that the energy market still isn’t working well for many people who don’t switch, so we looked carefully at how the merger would affect SVT prices.“Following a thorough investigation and consultation, we are confident that SSE and Npower are not close rivals for these customers and so the deal will not change how they set SVT prices.”Victoria Arrington at comparison site Energyhelpline said: “Even with the SSE-Npower merger going ahead, the energy market is still large and ied.“A competitive market with lots of quality players is what can help keep energy prices low for consumers.“With more than  suppliers to choose from, consumers have loads of opportunities to seek out a great energy deal,” she added.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"team leader at shetland home cope ltd ","story":"Are you just the right person to join our dynamic social enterprise, which promotes skill development for people with learning disabilities  We are looking for someone with the following to lead our busy team:Strong leadership and Retail Management experienceA passion for re-use and recycling..COPE Ltd is a charity and social enterprise."},{"url":null,"title":"windrush laxo vidlin ","story":"Offers over £,Originally used as a fishing lodge the property comprises two reception rooms , kitchen   diner, modern shower room, cloak room  store   utility area , on the ground floor, plus three double bedrooms  shower room on the first floor.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet.

If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism.

A second officer with responsibility for Ulster-Scots, sign language and other languages has also been appointed.The posts are jointly funded by Belfast City Council and Foras Na Gaeilge.The announcement was made during an event in City Hall presenting research by Conradh Na Gaeilge and the Committee on the Administration of Justice into how the north’s  councils are complying with their obligations with regard to the Irish language.Speaking at the launch Chief Executive of Belfast City Council Suzanne Wylie said: “I am absolutely delighted to be here today to celebrate the Irish language officers scheme and to welcome our Irish Language Officer Colm Mag Uiginn.“We also have our Irish Language Pfficers from Fermanagh, Omagh, Derry and Strabane here as well. It’s also great to see representatives from the Irish language community here today.“This council, earlier on this year under a dferent Mayor, launcheda five-year language strategy and we are now seeing the practical out-workings of that strategy including the appointment of the Irish Language Officer.“On behalf of myself and the other councils who have benefited from this scheme we thank Foras Na Gaeilge for this initiative.”Ms Wylie added: “Languages are something to be celebrated. Belfast has a close association with the Irish language, many of our place names are taken from Irish language whether it’s Béal Feirste, Bóthar na bhFál or Bóthar na Seanchille, Belfast heritage has got an enduring relationship with the Irish language going down centuries.“I think in many ways Irish speakers in Belfast were pioneers.

On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch .

Yet, Ciaran Johnston had the final say on proceedings to nail a free under intense pressure and in the face of a strong cross-field wind. As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month. The Shamrocks will get a chance to view their final opponents over the course of  minutes in Ballycastle on Sunday, but it would come as no great surprisean additional  minutes was required to separate St John’s and Cushendall.Roisin’s relief as decision to deny PIP is overturnedPic of the day, Thursday, October Search The Site \" onblur\"\"  Advertising Belfast Media Group copy .

We also cannot thank Ciaran Cunningham of Michael Brentnall Solicitors enough for his help with getting this disgraceful decision overturned.“Roisin still has a huge battle ahead of her but we believe this new treatment will be successful, her new treatment is very tough on her, Roisin’s cancer is a very fast growing cancer, her new treatment is making her very lethargic and it has nasty side effects but she is prepared, she knows what she is up against and she will continue to fight.”Pic of the Day, Wednesday, October Johnnies haven’t missed the boat insists McNultySearch The Site \" onblur\"\"  Advertising Belfast Media Group copy .

In his evidence, which the tribunal accepted, Mr Matier recalled that when he was giving his details to a man at the premises he was asked to state his age. When he replied that he was , he was told: \"I was looking for a younger person who I could train and move upstairs.\" Mr Matier askedthere was any point in continuing the conversation, and was told: \"No, not really.\"He said: \"I had been keen to get this job, and to be told I was too old to even apply for it really shook me. \"I had been off work for a while and I was trying to get back in to work. It was disheartening and it made me angry that my application could just be dismissed in this way because of my age.\"In its finding, the tribunal acknowledged that the incident \"had the effect of signicantly discouraging the claimant\".

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Master Cadets must successfully complete a demanding course designed to broaden and develop further the leadership, instructional and administrative responsibilities of senior Cadets who have already attained the prestigious Four Star Army Proficiency Certicate.The certicates were presented recently by Gillian Bingham, High Sherf of County Antrim.Congratulating the young people, Colonel Sam McCammond, Commandant of the ndBattalion Army Cadet Force, said: ldquoWe are delighted to see the enthusiasm and commitment of our Cadets recognised with the achievement of these latest accolades.ldquoWe are enormously proud of them and, indeed, they are each a credit not only to their detachments, but also to their families, schools and the wider community.ldquoAt a time when society tends to be quick to find fault with the younger generation, these young people are demonstrating great qualities and it is an absolute pleasure to see them reap the rewards of their hard work and sense of purpose.Col McCammond said the Cadet movement offers its members ldquogreat fun and camaraderie and also ldquoopens the door for signicant personal development.He continued: The awards which these Cadets, drawn from detachments at Down High School, Banbridge, Ballygowan and Killyleagh, collect today celebrate their progress and give our Cadets something truly signicant to put on their personal statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs.ldquoI congratulate them and the adult leaders who inspire and instruct them..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown until doors open at new Down Leisure Centre  ","story":"THE new poundm Down Leisure Centre will open at the end of next month.The stunning three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels and has the ldquowow factor Newry, Mourne and Down Council always promised it would have.Stretching across , square metres, council officials have no doubt the futuristic building will be the envy of many and viewed as an exemplar for others.The new centre features a  metre, six-lane swimming pool, a teaching pool with moveable floor, relaxation area with sauna, steam room and vitality pool along with a four-court multi-use sports hall.There is also a fantastic fitness suite with an extensive selection of equipment with some items the first of their kind to feature in any leisure centre in Ireland. The new centre also has two multi-purpose exercise studios featuring hi-tech spinning bikes.Council officials have this week set out the programme for closing the current leisure centre and opening its stunning replacement.Itrsquos anticipated that the existing leisure centre mdash which has long since passed its sell-by date mdash will close early next month. The new centre is expected to open three weeks later.When the door closes on the current facility, which will be subsequently bulldozed to pave the way for the construction of an expansive new car park, staff will transfer to the new multi-million pound centre for dedicated training and induction.Council officials are drawing up a programme ahead of the official opening to provide members of sports clubs and the public with an opportunity to sample what the new st century leisure centre has to offer and a chance to view its high-tech equipment.It is hoped the new centrersquos public launch will take place over the weekend of November  and  with full public access from November . These dates have to be confirmed.During the transition from the old centre to its modern replacement, the public are asked to use the local authorityrsquos nearby facilities at the Ballymote Health and Well-Being Centre in Downpatrick and the Newcastle Centre.Council officials are delighted with the new centre, in particular, the new teaching pool which has a moveable floor.Over recent years, there has been increasing pressure on swimming classes at Down Leisure Centre.Council officials are confident this will soon ease and are grateful to the public for their patience during the construction process.There are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room mdash the new leisure complexrsquos nerve centre mdash resembling something akin to a science fiction film set.Council director Michael Lipsett has described the new centre as a ldquofantastic building which people will appreciate and enjoy.

Itrsquos important we give riders some idea how to handle their machines.ldquoIrsquove had teachers from schools in Newcastle and Ballynahinch ands members of local road safety committees all expressing interest in the idea, he told the Recorder this week.ldquoWe are waiting now to hear the police reaction and then we can get together and work out something definite.Mr McBridersquos concern comes with a rising number of motorcycle accidents in the province. In the Ballynahinch area alone there have been several serious accidents this year.Among the proposals he has suggested to augment his own coaching course is specially built lsquotrail parksrsquo and an elementary riding test before anyone is allowed to buy a machine.ldquoPeople must know how to ride their machines safely, he said. Balance and technique are important.ldquoAnother important area is maintenance.

Four members, Billy Ogle, Felton Williamson, Sam Harrison and Joe Toland were flagged off from the Slieve Donard Hotel to start their marathon visitation around Ireland.Every Round Table in Ireland will be visited and a competition has been organised to guess the number of miles the journey will take.

Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place.

senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Andrew McCormick yesterday at the RHI Inquiry During yesterday’s hearing, Dr McCormick came under pressure to explain the repeated failures within his department and several actions where he personally should have acted more robustly in that period.Dr McCormick, one of Stormont’s most experienced mandarins, was asked about a private July  email from Dr Crawford to Mr Cairns in which he warned there would be “a massive spike” in applications to RHI and referred to “abuse” of the scheme.In another email, Dr Crawford explicitly said that “it pays producers to heat houses when their houses are empty as the rates are attractive”.Dr McCormick said he did not recall being warned about such a spike and that “wasn’t part of the discussion” at that point.He said: “It seems crystal clear from this email that Andrew Crawford understood the perverse incentive in the scheme in a way that we at that time did not. We should have [because] Janette O’Hagan had explained to us in very straightforward terms ... Andrew Crawford clearly understands it: ‘It pays producers to heat houses when their houses are empty as the rates are attractive’.“That’s a straightforward summary of the fundamental flaw in the scheme.”Referring to another of Dr Crawford’s emails, Dr McCormick said that the DUP Spad was “even clearer” in his understanding of the issue because “he explains the nature of the abuse that was at the heart of the problem”.He said: “Why neither Timothy nor Andrew came to us and said: This is what’s happening, here’s why it’s going wrong, here’s why you’ve got a sudden upturn in uptake –you’d even put that together with [finance official] Trevor Cooper’s points about suspicions about over-compensation, the opportunity for everything to fall into place and for us to realise the nature of the problem that we had and therefore to have acted urgently and to immediately fix it is an incredible lost opportunity.“I can’t see how there was not a consciousness to bring it to our attention on the part of both Andrew and Timothy.”Panel member Dame Una O’Brien asked: “Do you think it was being kept from you.”Dr McCormick said: “Yes. Well, that’s what happened. It was kept from us.”Body discovered on NI beachMotorcyclist dies following crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The mandarin went on: “To understand that, to know from the submission that we have a problem and we’re trying to solve the problem and not to say ‘you don’t understand your problem – here’s the real understanding’ is that not straightforwardly withholding information “It seems very, very clear to me that it is withholding information that was relevant to the submission that they both had.”Mr Cairns did, however, have some discussion with Dr McCormick’s deputy, Chris Stewart, about the issue because Mr Stewart emailed fellow officials a few days later to say that Mr Cairns “is concerned that there may be a further spike in demand”, although he did not use the phrase “massive”.And Mr Cairns has already told the inquiry that in that period he raised allegations of abuse of the scheme with Mr Stewart but that the department did not take the issue seriously.Dr McCormick was asked about multiple warnings to his officials about abuse of RHI which were ignored or dismissed. One of those warnings, a letter from boiler installer Solmatix in the summer of , alleged that some “unscrupulous” RHI claimants in the poultry sector were “actively exploiting it”.He said that should have been raised with the department’s internal auditors and others who could have investigated the allegation, but nothing appears to have been done.The department had been warned before about a failure to adequately listen to whistle-blowers and claimed that it had learnt lessons.Dr McCormick said that the evidence presented to the inquiry showed how much “noise” was being made by those contacting the department in dferent ways to make allegations of abuse or raise concerns about the scheme.He added: “Why it wasn’t heard – or whyit was heard it wasn’t acted on – I find deeply concerning.”He said that in the case of the letter from Solmatix, the source of the warning was known to the officials receiving it and therefore it would have had more weight. “The letter was also referring to ‘not possible abuse – they’re referring to ‘unscrupulous beneficiaries appearing to be actively exploiting it’.”Dr McCormick said: “It seems to me that a senior manager reading that would say: Stop everything we need to look at this we need to understand this what is going on here  “We need a very quick assessment as to whether this is spurious – is there any way in which this can be spurious  Or,there is substance, then we have to ask much more fundamental questions.“I can’t see how it can be read any other way than [as] something of a serious nature.”try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is an unprecedented and overwhelming vote that demonstrates the strength of this workforce’s determination to secure the Living Wage Foundation’s minimal pay baseline for decency.“The workforce ask only that Glen Dimplex pay the living wage which is set at £. and as a minimum keep pace with the rates set going forward. Our members have voted to raise themselves out of poverty pay permanently they are determined that they will not be just another ‘in-work poverty’ statistic. These are hard working production workers who manufacture domestic heating equipment - surely they deserve better than poverty pay Pointing to the company’s profitability, Ms Fitzgerald said that bosses had nowhere to hide when it came to meeting the workers’ legitimate pay demand.“The Glen Dimplex group is a highly successful global business. Their last accounts published showed an annual turnover of just below a billion euro, with profits for the year of € million and accumulated profits of €. While the bosses claim they can’t afford to pay a Living Wage to those who produce that wealth day and daily, they managed to find € million to pay a idend to shareholders for the year.“I will be meeting with union reps in the workplace to agree strike dates as part of a roll-out strategy for the industrial action. I call on the bosses to address our members’ legitimate and very modest pay expectations in order to avoid an unnecessary and disruptive industrial dispute”, Ms Fitzgerald finished.When contacted Glen Dimplex said there was no one available to comment.Tributes paid following death of ‘legend’ Tom ClarkeTV: how many young people were caught without a TV Licence in your area  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards. The company has ersied and grown in influence, with Mr McConville one of just two Northern Ireland business leaders joining Prime Minister Theresa May on an international trade mission to China.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/group_v2_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland building long term business partnerships","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by Ulster Business Eugene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group, Bank of Irelands Gavin Kennedy, Bridgene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group alongside Eamon McCay, Frylite, and Brian Connolly, Pinnacle Bank of Ireland UK has been backing Northern Ireland businesses across the generations. Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam.
