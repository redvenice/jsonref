He uses the quiet time to get some study done before starting on a two-hour and 40-minute journey by bus to college. Originally from Kenya, Wafula is one of some 21,000 international students studying in Ireland, many of whom are struggling.He was elated when he won a scholarship to research a PhD in finance at University College Dublin (UCD) in September 2020. Looking back, he wasn’t prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. Every day is a struggle to make ends meet, he says.His first year of study was online due to Covid restrictions. After securing temporary housing, it took Wafula more than 10 months to find suitable accommodation for his family to come to Ireland. He now lives with his wife – who is not permitted to work under her visa – and one of his children in Rathangan, Co Kildare, while the other child stays in Kenya.Wafula gets a monthly €1,500 scholarship stipend. He has worked as a tutor at the university, but his Stamp 2 visa limits him to work no more than 20 hours each week. His hours are precarious and he does not know if he will get any in the current semester.Meanwhile, his income is quickly swallowed up by his monthly rent (€1,100), electricity (€200) and daily commute (€18 a day).“It is practically impossible to live any life,” he says. “It becomes really hard to say you’re enjoying it.”Wafula admits experiencing mental health difficulties throughout his time here. “You have to put on a bold face, so your wife and kids don’t see that... I’m not enjoying the process, but maybe the outcome, which is getting a PhD and hopefully getting a job,” he says.Wafula wrote to UCD president Andrew Deeks in August, claiming international PhD students were “suffering in silence” and facing “systematic” discrimination during their time in Ireland.In a statement, UCD said international students receive an offer pack that references accommodation, the cost of living and visa advice. While the college generally has sufficient on-campus places for international students, it said that it does not currently have family accommodation.The university said PhD candidates have a student status and are deemed to be under full-time instruction, while scholarship holders are exempt from tax on their scholarship income.They are not normally employees, a spokesman said, and issues around employment are controlled by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.AbroadThe experiences of international students is raising wider questions around Ireland’s policy of attracting more and more students from abroad.While their higher fees are helping to plug holes in third-level funding, many international students argue that they are not being treating fairly and are not adequately warned about the cost of living or scarcity of accommodation.In Ireland, about 17,000 students from outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) are paying €10,000-€20,000 for their courses, though in some cases fees can be as high as €55,000.Most non-EEA students come from the US, China, India, Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Irish students pay a student contribution charge capped at €3,000.Bukky Adebowale, vice-president for equality and citizenship at the Union of Students in Ireland, says many international students feel they are treated as if they are cash-cows to prop up an under-funded third-level system. “They don’t feel heard,” says Adebowale.Bhumi Mehda, who is studying for a master’s in computer science, is one of them. She was required to have €40,000 in her bank account before being accepted into the State. On top of needing €25,600 for tuition fees at UCD, and after receiving some financial help from her parents, she took out a loan to finance the high cost of living in Ireland – but it still wasn’t enough.After arriving from India with her sister Jill at the end of the summer, she was met with the stark reality of Ireland’s housing crisis. Although they contacted 20-30 places a day, they struggled to find permanent accommodation. The sisters spent a month in temporary accommodation and were “freaking out” in fear of having no place to go.Less than 48 hours before they were due to leave their temporary accommodation, with no place to go, they finally secured a year-long tenancy agreement – but it didn’t come cheap. Bhumi, Jill and two friends now live close to Belfield campus in Dublin 4 and pay €2,500 a month for the two-bedroom house or €625 to share a bedroom far more than they budgeted.The  contacted all Irish universities to ask if they provide warnings to internationals regarding Ireland’s housing crisis prior to arrival. Many give general advice such as “book early” or tell students about “high demand” in the rental market. NUI Galway seems to go further than most by offering virtual “meet and greets” and information sessions for international students. The university also said it invites housing charity Threshold to provide accommodation guidance to incoming internationals.Bukky Adebowale of USI says the “honest truth” must be presented to internationals before coming to Ireland.Laura Harmon, executive director of the Irish Council for International Students, whose members include 30 higher-education institutions, says she does not think colleges are exploiting students. She argues that universities are following the national strategy on internationalising education in Ireland.But why aren’t students allowed to work more than 20 hours each week to cover their high costs? The Department of Justice, which issues their visas, maintains the sole reason for students being in the State is to study. The department said it must ensure students can survive on their own resources without relying on work.Plugging the gapThe move to “internationalise” higher education is Government policy. The Department of Education’s strategy in this area, due an update since 2020, aims to increase the economic output of these students from €819 million in 2014 to €1.15 billion by 2020 and increase the output of the English-language education sector by €200 million. The policy has been bearing fruit non-EEA students have more than doubled since 2011.The supply of lucrative international students has helped plug university finances in the years following the recession and, more recently, during the pandemic.Latest figures show Ireland’s main universities increased their student fee income in the first year of the pandemic at a time when most were confined to remote learning. No refunds were provided to international students neither were they entitled to the once-off €250 payment from the Government.“Maybe universities should not make so much money at the expense of people paying,” says Wafula.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris is shortly expected to begin long-awaited action on the 2016 Cassells report, which aims to address key funding issues in the sector. International students like Wafula and Bhumi hope they won’t be left behind in the new vision for the sector.International students: in numbers17,000Estimated number of students from outside the European Economic Area studying in IrelandEstimated economic output generated from international studentsTuition fees for most international students"},{"url":null,"title":"a 37 acre central bank site near m50 set to be designated for social housing","story":"The currency centre in Sandyford retains the facility to mint euro coin at the siteA large tract of Central Bank lands near the M50 motorway in south Dublin is set to be designated for social and affordable housing as the bank reviews the future of its high-security currency centre in Sandyford.The 37-acre site, home of the national mint for decades, is in the sights of the Land Development Agency (LDA) as it prepares to submit a statutory list to the Government of public lands suitable for housing. The agency, which was set up to amass and develop State property for housing, aims to build 8,000 new dwellings around the State over the next five years. Members of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have voted to provide residential and open space zoning on the Central Bank site, rejecting the proposal of planners in the council’s draft development plan to seek zoning for economic use. The council aims to adopt the 2022-2028 development plan next month. “These lands should provide local affordable homes for families in the Dundrum, Stillorgan, Sandyford areas,” said Fine Gael councillor Barry Saul. “People who grew up in the locality should be afforded the ability to purchase a new affordable home in their locality.”The Central Bank is listed as a relevant public body with relevant public land in the law underpinning the LDA. The bank is on a list of bodies whose lands must be built out with 100 per cent social and affordable housing if they come under LDA control, thereby limiting the price at which such property would transfer to the agency. This has led to some disquiet behind the scenes. Certain figures in the Central Bank have argued privately that the institution should not be compelled to sell land for less than the market rate, saying such a move would infringe its independence of the Government. The bank has ruled out a move in the short-term, saying in a statement that the timeframe would be “at least five to seven years” if change is recommended. “We continue to conduct a strategic review into the future of the currency centre in Sandyford,” it said. “If that strategic review recommends moving to another location, the Central Bank of Ireland will have due regard to the contents of the Land Development Agency Act and any planning regulations that are in place.”The bank has been in Sandyford for more than 40 years. The currency centre is a storage and distribution facility for bulk cash services, necessitating permanent Defence Forces protection and extensive surveillance. It stopped printing banknotes there in 2019 as euro notes are imported, but retains the facility to mint euro coin at the site.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"pandemic not over but safe to return to all activities holohan to say","story":"Dr Tony Holohan: Risks associated with Covid-19 are greatly reduced through vaccination. Photograph: Julien BehalPA Wire Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan will on Wednesday tell the Oireachtas health committee that while the Covid-19 pandemic “is not over, it is safe to return to the activities we all enjoy”.Dr Holohan is expected to provide an upbeat assessment of the situation regarding the disease in the State around 10 days after almost all restrictions were lifted.In a draft opening statement to the committee, he highlights the reduced demand for testing, lower rates of test positivity and a reduction in the number of cases ending up in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs).The number of people being treated in hospital for the disease stood at 624 on Tuesday, down 200 on the same day last week. This included 66 people being treated in ICU, down 13 in a week.The Department of Health on Tuesday reported a further 4,208 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in addition to the 6,410 positive antigen tests that were logged through the HSE’s online portal.In his remarks, Dr Holohan says “the epidemiological profile of Covid-19 nationally provides a broadly positive outlook”.He says incidence of the disease remains high, but has reduced from its peak and that Covid-19 related mortality remains relatively stable.Dr Holohan goes on to credit the population’s engagement with the vaccination programme for the “much improved situation”. He says that it remains “critical” for people to self-isolate if they have symptoms.‘Greatly reduced’Dr Holohan is to note that the removal of restrictions will cause anxiety for some people who are immunocompromised or more vulnerable to the severe effects of Covid-19.“I wish to assure those who may be anxious that the risks associated with Covid-19 are greatly reduced through vaccination and that, with appropriate caution, they should go about their daily lives,” his statement says.More broadly he adds: “It is important that people are assured that, while the pandemic is not over, it is safe to return to the activities we all enjoy – in terms of socialising, exercise, family, work and travel.”Dr Holohan says Omicron, which fuelled the surge in cases after Christmas, is unlikely to be the last variant of concern to emerge and that “the global public health risk remains very high”.“Therefore, we must remain vigilant and ensure that our response is agile and flexible, with an ability to respond rapidly and appropriately to any emerging threat.”Meanwhile, four further people who recently tested positive for Covid-19 have died in Northern Ireland and another 4,622 cases were reported on Tuesday.There were 337 Covid-19 inpatients in the North’s hospitals on Tuesday, including 21 people in intensive care.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"denmark and norway lift most remaining covid restrictions","story":"Customers at the fishmarket in Torvehallerne in Copenhagen on Tuesday, as Denmark becomes the first EU country to lift coronavirus restrictions.

Mask mandates no longer apply, nightclubs can reopen and businesses can decide whether to check customers’ vaccine certificates. In Norway, working from home will no longer be required, and the cap of 10 visitors in private homes is ending, prime minister Jonas Gahr Store said. Both countries are dealing with recent spikes in cases because of the Omicron variant. Neither has seen a corresponding rise in hospitalisations. “Even if many more people are becoming infected, there are fewer who are hospitalised,” Mr Store said. “We’re well protected by vaccines.” The Danish government said it no longer considers Covid a “socially critical disease” – a political designation that allows officials to enforce broad measures such as business closures and mask mandates – in part because of the country’s high vaccination rate.A mutated version of the Omicron variant known as BA. 2 has been fuelling a surge in Denmark, the Statens Serum Institut recently reported, and the country has recently averaged about 44,000 new cases a day, about 70 per cent more than two weeks ago. About 80 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated and about 60 per cent have had a booster dose, according to Our World in Data, a project at the University of Oxford.Denmark is among the first European Union members to abandon pandemic restrictions in favour of treating the virus as endemic.

Video: Reutersas creditedChairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat: The first MP to say publicly  he would seek the prime minister role if Boris Johnson goes. Photograph:  Niall CarsonPA A report into lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street could be published as early as Monday, although it remains uncertain how much of its material will be redacted. The politan Police last week requested that cabinet office official Sue Gray should avoid giving details of the most serious allegations which are now the subject of a police investigation.But Labour’s shadow levelling-up secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the report must be published in full to put an end to the “circus” in Downing Street.“The reason that we’ve got to have the Sue Gray report is because the prime minister won’t come clean on what has been going on in Downing Street and his involvement in it. We could sort all of this out without him having to hide behind a civil servant or the Met Police, he could just come clean. But since he won’t come clean, we believe that the most important thing is to get that report out in full,” she told the BBC.‘Huge sacrifices’ “There are a lot of bereaved families. There are a lot people who made huge sacrifices who deserve to hear the truth from the prime minister. And if he won’t put an end to this circus and this stasis in government, when people are dealing with huge issues around the country, cost-of-living crisis, levelling-up plans stalled, if he won’t do it, then that report has to come out in full, so that people can judge for themselves.”Boris Johnson’s allies believe his position has stabilised over the past week as Conservative MPs have been waiting for Ms Gray’s report before deciding whether to move against him. Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, has become the first MP to say publicly that he would seek the leadership if Mr Johnson goes.“It’s up to all of us to put ourselves forward. And it’s up to the electorate, in the first case parliamentary colleagues, and in the second case the party, to choose,” he told Times Radio.‘A duffer’Mr Johnson’s former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, said on Sunday that removing the prime minister from office was “an unpleasant but necessary job . . . like sort of fixing the drains”. In an interview with New York magazine, Mr Cummings rejected the suggestion that it was unfair to attempt to push Mr Johnson out of Downing Street two years after he won a general election.“The fact that someone wins an election doesn’t mean that they should just stay there for years, right? If you’ve got a duffer, if you think someone can’t do the job, or is unfit for the job. My basic approach to it was there was a world in which he accepted his limitations and accepted that No 10 could work in a certain way with him there as prime minister. But if he’s not going to do that and if he’s just going treat the place like his own,” he said.“You know, as he said to me, ‘I’m the f***ing king around here and I’m going to do what I want.’ That’s not okay. He’s not the king. He can’t do what he wants.

He is in good company. British prime ministers – with the exception of Harold Wilson and David Cameron – don’t tend to “go gentle into that good night”, preferring instead to cling on, limpet-like until their party is removed from office at the ballot box or, like Johnson’s immediate predecessor Theresa May, they are effectively forced out by colleagues hoping (not altogether unreasonably, it turns out) that a change of leader may persuade the public to forget their failings and give them a second chance. As post-war political history shows us, even serious ill health hasn’t been enough to prevent previous prime ministers trying hard to bag and then hang on to the top job for as long as they can – although it has, for at least a couple of them, eventually furnished a convenient excuse for bowing out earlier than they might have wished.Winston Churchill, for instance, was already in pretty poor shape by the time he regained the premiership in 1951 at the age of 76, and many of his colleagues – not least his ambitious foreign secretary, Anthony Eden – hoped he would retire after a year or so. But, in spite of an array of medical problems and an increasingly evident decline in his powers, he refused to relinquish the prize. And such was the Conservative Party’s concern not to be seen to be ditching the country’s iconic wartime leader that, even after he suffered a massive stroke in June 1953 that left him incapacitated for months, his colleagues connived in keeping the full story from the public.Things might have been different for Churchill had Eden, ironically enough, not been ill himself as the result of a botched operation earlier that year. So serious were its consequences, in fact, that by the time Churchill was prevailed upon to reluctantly call it a day in the spring of 1955, Eden, too, was already long past his best. Even though his premiership got off to a superb start – he called an election almost immediately after taking over and increased the Tories’ overall majority from 17 to 60 – he was soon driving his ministers to distraction with what many of them regarded as his unwarranted interference in the running of their departments.Naturally, their irritation pales into insignificance with the cause of Eden’s eventual departure in early 1957 – his responsibility for the doomed attempt to snatch back the Suez Canal in the autumn of 1956 and the knowledge among his colleagues that he had misled Parliament in denying any collusion with Israel and France in the build-up to the operation.The episode emphasises the role (one reprised half a century later under Tony Blair) that a major miscalculation in foreign and military affairs can play in bringing down a premiership, especially when combined with a prime minister being seen to have been less than honest with the public on the issue. But it also risks blinding us to the equally important role played by far more mundane domestic considerations.Because Suez looms so large in the story of Eden’s undoing, we forget that soon after the election, his chancellor, Rab Butler was forced to introduce a humiliating emergency budget just months after he had helped win the 1955 election with something of a giveaway before it. We forget, too, that – partly as a result – less than a year into his premiership Eden was being called on (by a disappointed Daily , no less) to demonstrate “the smack of firm government”.Indeed, it was those domestic difficulties, even though they weren’t reflected in a particularly significant loss of support in the polls (which came out far less frequently in those days anyway), that led Eden to reshuffle both Butler and Macmillan, much to the chagrin of both – one reason, along with their transparent desire to succeed him, why they did little or nothing to help their boss out over Suez and its aftermath.In the event, it was the 62-year-old Macmillan who, after Eden resigned (not altogether unreasonably) pleading ill health, “emerged” as his replacement following “soundings” of the parliamentary party taken by senior Conservatives. And like Eden, he began well, turning things around after Suez and aligning the political and economic cycle to ensure that voters had “never had it so good”, resulting not only in a third consecutive election victory for the Tories at the general election of 1959 but yet another substantial increase in their Commons majority.Again, however, a combination of economic difficulties at home and policy controversy abroad (not least his embrace of the end of empire and his failed attempt to join the EEC), soon saw his government run into trouble. Moreover, the sharp increase in the commissioning of opinion polls made its unpopularity even more glaringly obvious for all to see, as did a series of stunning by-election reverses – probably the first time, but by no means the last time, that such defeats would play a role in putting a premature end to a premiership.The same can be said for another key factor in Macmillan’s early departure (which, like Eden’s, was officially put down to ill health) – namely the appearance of an opposition leader who appears more in touch with the public’s mood and priorities and who they can imagine standing on the steps of No 10. The Profumo affair in 1963, along with 1962’s infamous Night of the Long Knives, during which a panicky Macmillan sacked half his Cabinet, may have confirmed voters’ suspicions that he was past it. But Wilson did a fair bit to help them toward that conclusion.Whether Labour’s Neil Kinnock played as big a role in Margaret Thatcher’s departure in November 1990 is rather more doubtful. But, in truth, he didn’t really need to. All the other elements were there: major policy failures and controversies (the Poll Tax and Europe) economic difficulties (the return of inflation worries) alienated, ambitious and seriously worried colleagues (Howe, Heseltine and Major) the party’s declining support revealed in poll after poll and dramatised by one or two spectacular by-election defeats (most obviously Eastbourne) an obvious waning (possibly due to incipient illness) of the premier’s powers and a sense, overall, that they had done the job the party had needed them to do and that, since they were no longer trusted by voters and had gone from being an electoral asset to an electoral liability, it was time to spin the wheel and move on.A look at that list – and at the history books more generally – should surely worry Johnson, especially now that Labour (probably for the first time since Blair) can boast a leader of the opposition who, for all his lack of charisma, probably passes the proverbial ‘blink test’ as a potential prime minister. Just as they were under Theresa May, most, if not all, of the criteria for an early exit would appear to be met. And if Johnson does eventually go, then, unlike some of his predecessors, the current occupant of No 10 won’t be able to plead infirmity – except, his critics would say, moral infirmity – as even the flimsiest of excuses. Tim Bale is professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of LondonMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Brexit a \u0026#39wake up call\u0026#39 to level up after mistakes by both parties, says Michael GoveUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to speak with Vladimir Putin after visit to KyivWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?Australia denies its aid ship forced Tonga into lockdown by bringing island\u0026#39s first coronavirus caseWednesday morning UK news briefing: 12 missions to \u0026#39level up\u0026#39 BritainDuchess of Cambridge ready to tackle her next role ... as patron of England rugby boardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hormone replacement therapy sold counter first time","story":"Hormone replacement therapy is to be made available over the counter for the first time, watchdogs are poised to announce.Until now, women have only been able to access the medication after consultation with a GP or specialist.Every year, around 1.5 million women experience troubling post-menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbance and emotional problems. Of those, around 150,000 are prescribed HRT in the form of tablets, gels, creams or patches.The  can disclose that watchdogs are set to propose a reclassification of the medication so women are able to access it in a pharmacy without a prescription.It follows changes last summer that saw the contraceptive pill sold over the counter following a relaxation of rules by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.It also comes after a long campaign to improve access to HRT and reduce the cost for women who receive it on prescription.In October, ministers announced that costs would be cut by up to £200 a year after the Government backed a campaign championed by celebrities including Penny Lancaster and Davina McCall. Under that change, costs of up to £19 per month can be replaced by one annual prescription for the same cost.The latest proposal aims to improve convenience so that women are able to access HRT more easily, without needing a GP appointment. But it follows years of debate over the risks and benefits of HRT, which has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.Haitham Hamoda, the chairman of the British Menopause Society, said: Improving access to HRT is a good thing, but it is really important that women can access all the help and advice they need.It\u0027s great that there is so much conversation about menopause now, and people are far more open about it. But we don\u0027t want this to come down to a question of self-diagnosis – it\u0027s really important that those thinking about starting HRT get the right information.Some pharmacists already employ trained prescribers who are able to issue medicines on prescription. The latest changes may still require a consultation with a pharmacist, as is the case when the contraceptive pill is purchased over the counter.The number of women taking HRT therapy fell dramatically after a major 2002 study linked it to an increased risk of breast cancer. Since then, evidence has been conflicting.In 2015, NHS watchdogs said far more help should be offered to those suffering debilitating night sweats and hot flushes. Experts from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence suggested at least twice as many women could benefit from HRT as were actually on it, saying far too many had been left in unbearable misery.In 2019, a Lancet review said the therapy raised the risks of breast cancer by one third. It found that while the risk of breast cancer was 6.3 per cent for women aged between 50 and 69 who have not taken HRT, it rises to 8.3 per cent for those on the most common combination of HRT.The medication works by boosting levels of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which are lower among women during the menopausal period.  Last year, a study found that taking hormone replacement therapy during the menopause does not increase the risk of dementia. However, staying on HRT long term was linked to a slight increase in the risk of Alzheimer\u0027s.The changes will mean pharmaceutical manufacturers can apply for reclassification of their products, allowing over-the-counter sale under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist.  They come as ministers prepare to extend rules that allow abortion pills to be taken at home. Since the start of the Covid pandemic, home abortions have been allowed in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy in legislation due to expire at the end of next month. But the  understands that period will now be extended in a move likely to anger anti-abortion groups and some MPs.Clare Murphy, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: Improving access to HRT as well as abortion and contraception is really important for women, so this is extremely welcome news.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: We understand that, for some women, menopause symptoms can have a significant impact on their quality of life, and we are committed to improving the care and support they receive.That\u0027s why we\u0027re developing the first ever government-led Women\u0027s Health Strategy, informed by women\u0027s lived experience. Menopause, including improving access to Hormone Replacement Therapy, will be a priority under the strategy.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Brexit a \u0026#39wake up call\u0026#39 to level up after mistakes by both parties, says Michael GoveUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to speak with Vladimir Putin after visit to KyivWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?Australia denies its aid ship forced Tonga into lockdown by bringing island\u0026#39s first coronavirus caseWednesday morning UK news briefing: 12 missions to \u0026#39level up\u0026#39 BritainDuchess of Cambridge ready to tackle her next role ... as patron of England rugby boardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"insulate britain activists cleared blocking m25 standing roundabout","story":"Three Insulate Britain activists have been cleared of blocking the M25 last November because they were standing on a roundabout. National Highways had launched legal action against 19 members of the group after they had allegedly breached an injunction forbidding them from blocking roads on the motorway.  Lawyers acting for the government-owned company claimed Arne Springorum and Jessica Causby had glued themselves to the pavement at Junction 23 of the M25 and said Liam Norton “endangered the free flow of traffic”. But on Tuesday the trio were told they were “free to go” by a judge after evidence emerged they were protesting on the South Mimms roundabout, which their counsel argued did not form part of the M25.  This is despite Mr Norton, a ringleader for the organisation who had admitted last October he was a “hypocrite” as his own home wasn’t insulated, commenting at the start of the proceedings “he did not have a leg to stand on”.  “I was aware I was going to breach the restriction,” he told London’s High Court.  Similarly, Mr Springorum, who works as an energy efficiency consultant, said: “I feel strongly that I am in breach of the injunction.” Lord Justice William Davis stressed the trio had not been spared jail because of a “technicality’’ but because the claimant was unable to prove they were in contempt of court. The judge said although the group were “anxious for the opposite to be done” they were free “to go”, prompting rounds of applause in the court from supporters.   “We are not satisfied that the three people in respect of whom committal proceedings have been brought in relation to events of November 2 were in breach of the injunction,” he added.Proceedings against the remaining 16 activists, including a 79-year-old reverend and a retired GP, descended into a farce after four of the defendants glued themselves to the steps outside the court.   Theresa Norton, Dr Diana Warner, El Litten, and Steve Pritchard were taken into custody after officers prised them off the steps.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Brexit a \u0026#39wake up call\u0026#39 to level up after mistakes by both parties, says Michael GoveUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to speak with Vladimir Putin after visit to KyivWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?Australia denies its aid ship forced Tonga into lockdown by bringing island\u0026#39s first coronavirus caseWednesday morning UK news briefing: 12 missions to \u0026#39level up\u0026#39 BritainDuchess of Cambridge ready to tackle her next role ... as patron of England rugby boardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"true scale government pandemic waste revealed 87bn overspent","story":"Some £8.7 billion of taxpayers’ money spent on personal protective equipment (PPE) has been written off, according to annual accounts detailing the losses accrued by the pandemic.Government documents reveal vast sums spent on goods that were never used, or were not fit for purpose, with warnings from auditors that even now, effective control of spending has not been established.According to the 2020-21 Department of Health and Social Care accounts, some £673 million worth of PPE equipment was found to be unusable, and £750 million was spent on items that were not used before their expiry date.Nearly £2.6 billion was spent on “items not suitable for use in the NHS”, which the department now hopes to sell or give to charity.In total, the Government spent £12.1 billion on PPE in 2020-21, the accounts state. But £8.7 billion of this was wasted, including around £4.7 billion accounted for by falling market prices.At the start of the pandemic, prices for protective equipment rose sharply as countries clamoured to get hold of items such as face masks.The accounts further reveal that the DHSC expects that equipment that was scheduled to be delivered after the end of the financial year will lose £1.2 billion in value.After struggling to obtain sufficient PPE for the UK at the start of the pandemic, Britain amassed a surplus by autumn 2020. As a result, the Government was charged £111.5 million in fines for delays shifting PPE from ports to storage facilities.The accounts show £350 million worth of fruit and vegetables was thrown away, after the suspension of a scheme delivering produce to schools.The DHSC had already contracted to pay for produce to be delivered to schools, leading to a loss of £1.25 million, which comprised distribution costs of £657,000 and produce costs of £590,000.The DHSC said it had donated £247,000 of the fruit and vegetables to food charities.Further losses recorded in the annual accounts include £1.1 million amounting to the value of 70 per cent of an undelivered order for ventilators “which did not fully meet functionality requirements at the time”.The accounts said: “Consequently, the remainder of the order was cancelled. As the supplier had technically met the contract’s specification and had already incurred costs, 30 per cent of the contract value was unable to be recovered.”During the year, the DHSC wrote off laboratory equipment valued at £663,000 following the closure of two regional testing sites and “there being no alternative options for repurposing or storing these assets”.In addition, £313,000 worth of intensive care items were written off, after reaching their expiry date.Cancellation charges of £649,000 were spent on flights from China which had to be cancelled for lack of stocks, with £339,000 charges when contracts for quarantine hotels were cancelled.The Government’s auditor, the comptroller and auditor general to the House of Commons, said in his section regarding the accounts that the DHSC was put under “extraordinary pressure” by the pandemic and had to operate outside normal processes and procedures.But he said it “was not able to manage adequately some of the elevated risks, resulting in significant losses for the taxpayer. Nearly two years later, it has not fully restored effective control over some of the inventory purchased”.“The chief secretary to the Treasury wrote to the department on 21 December 2021 confirming HM Treasury’s view that £1.3 billion of the department’s spending did not have proper HM Treasury consent and was irregular. He stated that ‘in the vast majority of cases’ this was because either the department or NHS England had spent funds without approval or in express breach of the conditions that had been set.”Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary said: “This is a shocking and inexcusable level of waste that could have been put to far better use in hospitals and care homes that are under-staffed and over-stretched.“Taxpayers’ money has been poured down the drain at a time when a record 6 million people are on NHS waiting lists.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our absolute priority throughout this unprecedented global pandemic has always been saving lives.“In a highly competitive global market where many countries imposed export bans, we acted swiftly to obtain 30,000 ventilators by the end of June 2020 and we have delivered over 17.5 billion items of PPE to the frontline, with 97 per cent of PPE we ordered being suitable for use.“The supply of these vital items helped keep our NHS open at a moment of national crisis to deliver a world-class service to the public. We are seeking to recover costs from suppliers wherever possible.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Brexit a \u0026#39wake up call\u0026#39 to level up after mistakes by both parties, says Michael GoveUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to speak with Vladimir Putin after visit to KyivWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?Australia denies its aid ship forced Tonga into lockdown by bringing island\u0026#39s first coronavirus caseWednesday morning UK news briefing: 12 missions to \u0026#39level up\u0026#39 BritainDuchess of Cambridge ready to tackle her next role ... as patron of England rugby boardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"van gogh self portraits reunited first time century moving exhibition","story":"A Van Gogh exhibition has reunited two of the artist’s self-portraits for the first time in 130 years, helping the host gallery frame itself as more than just a “hidden treasure” on London’s cultural map.The Courtauld Gallery’s curatorial coup comes after its £57 million renovation, and signals its ambitions to establish itself alongside the Tate and National Gallery as a must-visit destination on the capital’s well-trodden tourist trail.It is the first ever exhibition devoted to self-portraits from throughout Vincent Van Gogh’s career, and comes as the Courtauld seeks to offer more “bespoke” shows highlighting specific elements of an artist’s work.Two self-portraits which have not been seen together since they were painted in the French asylum where he was treated in 1889 will be displayed, along with 14 other self-portraits assembled by curators through rare loan deals with galleries around the world.Ernst Vegelin, the head of the Courtauld Gallery, told the : “Following the success of our re-opening, the Courtauld is a hidden treasure no more.“With our world-class collection and exhibitions, it is very much our ambition to be on the cultural trail of every visitor to London.“The Van Gogh exhibition is our first major step towards realising that aim.“It is also the case that the Courtauld’s shows have a very different character from those in our great national institutions.”Mr Vegelin said that the gallery saw itself “as enriching the exhibition landscape” in London, rather than seeking to compete.Van Gogh created 35 surviving self-portraits in under four years. They include two painted in the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in the south of France - one in the grip of a severe mental health crisis, and the other a week later while he was recovering.The two self-portraits were secured in rare loan deals - never achieved to date by any other gallery - with the National Museum of Art in Oslo and the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.Dr Karen Serres, a Courtauld curator, said that seeing the works side by side at last will give visitors a “moving” insight into Van Gogh’s unstable mental state, which contributed to his suicide at 37 in 1890.Dr Serres said that the Courtauld’s ownership of Van Gogh’s “iconic” Self-Portrait with a Bandaged Ear - left by Samuel Courtauld, the gallery’s art collector founder - helped persuade galleries to loan their masterpieces.She told the : “It does give us a lot of cachet and influence, it is a bit of a secret secret weapon. It gives us lots of inroads.“The fact that we have one of these iconic images, as the Bandaged Ear is, can be incredibly persuasive.“Our reputation preceded us, in a way. Having that associate with Van Gogh did make it easier to get these paintings, although it has been a very long process. Galleries knew they were going to be in good hands.”Alongside the self-portraits, the Courtauld will show Van Gogh’s Chair and Portrait of Eugène Boch, the artist’s friend.All works will be displayed in the new Denise Coates Exhibition Galleries, named after the gallery donor and Bet365 founder.The show follows a three-year closure for renovation work at its home at Somerset House on the Strand, which started in 2018.The Morgan Stanley Exhibition: Van Gogh.

Wordle, the online word puzzle turned sleeper viral hit, has been bought by the New York Times for a seven-figure sum, just weeks after its creator Josh Wardle said: “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun. It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs.”It’s hard to blame Wardle, a British software engineer from near Abergavenny but based in Brooklyn, or wish him anything other than good luck. Knowing his partner loved word games, Wardle created the guessing game for her, naming it Wordle as a play on his own surname. But once it caught on in his family’s WhatsApp group he released it to the rest of the world in October last year and its popularity snowballed beyond his wildest dreams. How many of us, having – as he did – created the game as a fun challenge for his partner, would turn down more than a million bucks? The gratitude of strangers doesn’t pay the bills. Besides, the experience of going from unknown to internet stardom must be incredibly discombobulating. “I’d be lying if I said this hasn’t been a little overwhelming,” he said.But by the same token it’s difficult to escape the feeling that something pure and innocent has been broken. Since it first appeared last October, Wordle has been free from advertising and subscription alike, uncluttered by adverts or notifications. Wardle himself was endearingly honest about his lack of greed. “I don’t have to charge people money for this and ideally would like to keep it that way,” he said last month. “The business side of things is not super interesting to me at all, and I can’t imagine anyone paying… I’m just kind of suspicious of apps and games that want your endless attention. I worked in Silicon Valley. I know why they do that. I kind of deliberately did what you’re not meant to do if growth is your goal. I think people have an appetite for things that transparently don’t want anything from you.”Jonathan Knight, general manager of the New York Times’ games ision, says Wordle “has done what so few games have done: it has captured our collective imagination.” He’s right about that. I’m one of the millions – at least two million and counting, up from 90 players in November and 300,000 at the beginning of January – who play it every day, sometimes clicking on the homepage at exactly midnight when a new puzzle goes live.The rules are simple: you have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. If you guess the right letter in the right place that letter turns green, the right letter in the wrong place turns yellow, and a wrong letter stays grey. I have good-natured competitions going on with my wife and friends, though the essential benevolence (at least from my end) is regularly tested by the fact that it takes me noticeably more attempts than it does them. I maintain that this is because I’m a writer and therefore think of many more different words than they do. Their replies provide me with yet more possible answers for future puzzles: if not for Wordle itself, then for its smutty parody Lewdle.There are many reasons for the game’s success. It’s an intellectual exercise, and we like to feel clever. It’s hard, but not too hard: the answer is always an obvious one in retrospect (even if British players were upset the other day when the chosen word was FAVOR, spelt the American way). “I feel smart when I get a Wordle, even though I made the game,” Wardle says. “It’s about the journey, especially on days where I’m really stumped and have to think about it. It’s sufficiently hard to enable me to hit a sense of accomplishment that feels good.” We can try to work out which words are best to start with (at least two vowels and probably an ‘S’ too). We have to think not just of inidual letters but of combinations too: ‘r’ is often a good second letter after a hard consonant such as ‘p’ or ‘t’.Social media and messaging services have made results easy to share, and the grid Wardle has designed for this is perfect: it shows your results without giving away the answers. In the progress from one colourful line to the next is a litany of decisions, guesses, failures and triumphs. The mixture of isolation and connectivity which these grids represent is a perfect reflection of pandemic times. “I get emails from people who say things like ‘Hey, we can’t see our parents due to Covid at the moment but we share our Wordle results each day’,” Wardle says. “During this weird time it’s a way for people to connect in a low-effort, low-friction way.”“The fact that we are all trying to solve the same puzzle brings us together,” says psychologist Lee Chambers. “There’s both a sense of community in terms of ‘How difficult did people find it this time?’ and a competitive angle in terms of ‘How well did I stack up in finding this word compared to everyone else?’’’Most of all, Wordle’s success has been down to the fact that there’s only one a day. We live in an age not just of more, more, more but also of now, now, now: everything we want is available instantly in its entirety. TV shows, films, books, games: they’re all just a click away. But Wordle is different. There’s no cache of old games, no easy store of upcoming ones (yes, computer scientists have broken the source code and you can find websites where all future answers are listed, but where’s the fun in that?) There’s just today’s game, nothing else. It harks back to the days of vinyl records and analogue TV, of 90-minute TDK cassettes and the Radio 1 charts on Sunday afternoon: simpler times in a less atomised society. “The internet is in a really bad place at the moment, but this is great because it’s not doing all those nasty things,” says Adam Procter, who leads the computer game design course at Southampton University.Wordle is not, it has to be said, especially original: there are shades both of the TV show Lingo and the 1970s peg-and-board game Mastermind, which had on the lid a bearded man and a woman in white staring at the camera with disturbing intensity. But very few games can claim to have a single inventor: number puzzles, for example, began in French newspapers in the late 19th century, whereas Sudoku’s popularity in the West today is a joint effort between American puzzle constructor Howard Garns (whose grids ran in magazines from 1979) and Hong Kong judge Wayne Gould, who developed a computer programme capable of rapidly producing multiple unique puzzles.Wordle’s success also points to a wider social trend: we are obsessed with puzzles. No pub is complete without a quiz, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? has entered the national psyche, Mastermind is still going 50 years after its first broadcast and University Challenge now gets former alumni back for Christmas spin-offs to go alongside the main franchise. GCHQ advertises for codebreakers and puzzle solvers. Crime fiction, which is all about using clues to solve mysteries, remains hugely popular both in bookstores and on TV: before Richard Osman’s multi-million-selling Thursday Murder Club series came Dan Brown, whose Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code were essentially coded treasure hunts wrapped up in thriller clothes. Newspapers carry entire supplements of Sudoku grids, crosswords and other puzzles. Interestingly, the modern crossword also dates from troubled times, beginning in American newspapers in 1913, just before World War I. Crosswords became ever more popular during the Great Depression as a distraction from people’s troubles, and only one newspaper held out against including one until after Pearl Harbor – the same one that has just bought Wordle.The New York Times has pledged that Wordle will “be free to play for new and existing players, and no changes will be made to its gameplay,” at least for the time being. And if the game remains essentially the same, the logical and intellectual challenges it poses should also be undimmed. But those are only part of what makes, or perhaps made, Wordle so special. It was something we felt belonged to us all, unmonetised and unexploited, and now it belongs to a £5bn corporation. If ever there was a moral for our times – or perhaps a MORAL for our TIMES, get it in six tries or fewer – it is this.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Brexit a \u0026#39wake up call\u0026#39 to level up after mistakes by both parties, says Michael GoveUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to speak with Vladimir Putin after visit to KyivWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?Australia denies its aid ship forced Tonga into lockdown by bringing island\u0026#39s first coronavirus caseWednesday morning UK news briefing: 12 missions to \u0026#39level up\u0026#39 BritainDuchess of Cambridge ready to tackle her next role ... as patron of England rugby boardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits cant afford lose 2000","story":"Brits cant afford to lose £, more every year without help from governmentThe Cabinet Ministers increasing taxes on incomes through National Insurance or failing to cool rising prices – particularly soaring fuel bills – are a major part of the problemBoris Johnson and the Conservative Party only pretend they support people Image: UK PARLIAMENT AFP via Getty ImagopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb |comments Slashing the living standards of families who are already feeling the squeeze could trigger a ferocious backlash against the Conservatives and Boris Johnson.Households simply cannot lose nearly £, in spending power without feeling intense pain or plunging into debt.

What a waste We are learning how the Conservatives cannot be trusted with taxpayers’ money as they admitted to £.billion losses on Covid PPE contracts worth £.bn. Every piece of unusable, unsuitable and overpriced item is charged to the British public and the colossal waste of our money by the Government is indefensible.

Gray was forced to publish the first part without any inclusion of evidence as the police probe is still ongoing.The publication of the update led to Johnson addressing the findings with an apology, but he also resorted to accusations against the opposition leader.Where can I watch Keir Starmeraposs speech  Starmeraposs speech to the House of Commons in response to the Prime Ministeraposs statement on the Sue Gray report can be viewed on The Mirroraposs YouTube channel here. The PM also suggested with with no evidence that the Labour frontbench were on drugs.A full account of the proceedings, including the PMaposs statement, the controversial accusation about Jimmy Saville made by Boris Johnson and the response from MPs, can be seen on the BBC iPlayer here.After the Prime Ministeraposs statement, the opposition leaderaposs reply starts just after the six-minute mark. What did Keir Starmer say to Boris Johnson   The PM apologised for the findings of the report, telling the House: I get it and I will fix it. Itaposs no use saying this or that was within the rules and itaposs no use saying people were working hard. This pandemic was hard for everyone, he added. In response, Starmer said: Funerals have been missed, dying relatives have been unvisited. Every family has been marred by what we have been through. And revelations about the Prime Minister’s behaviour have forced us all to rethink and relive those darkest moments. Many have been overcome by rage, by grief and even by guilt.  Whatever people’s politics, whatever party they vote for, honesty and decency matter. Our great democracy depends on them. Cherishing and nurturing British democracy is what it means to be patriotic. There are Conservative members who know that, and they know that the Prime Minister is incapable of it.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford was kicked out of the chamber as he refused to withdraw his claim that Johnson had knowingly lied to the house.What did Sue Grayaposs report say   The full report has not yet been published, but the update criticised failures of leadership and judgement in  Downing Street. Gray revealed that police are looking into  gatherings.  Police have since said they have received well over  pieces of paper, about a ream and a half, and over  photographs.A full rundown of the initial Gray update can be viewed here.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON House of CommonsLabour Partypolitan PoliceJimmy SavileBoris JohnsonCivil servantsPoliticsKeir Starmer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Treasury insiders denied that Mr Johnson had set a precedent that other ministers should follow.  They said Mr Sunak had felt it was important to be visible and supportive of the Government on the day Sue Gray published an update of her report. The Chancellor later attended a crowded meeting of the Toriesapos backbench  committee in a show of solidarity with his beleaguered boss. And he led Treasury questions in the House of Commons chamber on Tuesday.  Mr Sunak, who was one of the only ministers wearing a facemask on the frontbench, tested negative before the Commons statement.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, sitting on Ms Patelaposs other side, later tested positive for Covid and was forced to miss her trip to the Ukraine with the PM. The legal requirement to stay at homeyou have a positive case in your household is no longer in place.But official NHS guidance still “strongly advises” people to limit close contact with others in crowded spaces and work from homepossible.It states that they should limit close contact with other people outside your household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces. The advice adds that people should work from homeyou are able to and wear a face-covering in crowded places. A spokesman for Mr Sunak said: The Chancellor has followed the legal requirements to the letter. “He has taken daily lateral flow tests and has limited his social contact where possible, whilst also ensuring that he is able to continue to conduct important Government and Parliamentary business as the public would expect.  Just last month, No  announced Mr Johnson was unlikely to be seen in public for a week after a member of his immediate family, later revealed to be baby Romy, tested positive for Covid. The PMaposs official spokesman said he would heed official guidance to limit outside contacts as much as possible for seven days after the test. “In line with the guidance, he’s reducing contact, he told reporters. He’ll be working from No , doing daily tests and limiting contact with others both outside No  and indeed inside No  as well, having limited contact with others in the building, and conducting meetings online.” However, Mr Johnson faced accusations he was hiding behind the illness, as it came while he faced intense scrutiny over his attendance at a BYOB garden party in No  during lockdown. The PM cancelled a visit to a vaccination centre in Lancashire, where he would have faced tough media questions, while a Downing Street press conference was also axed.

Mr Aldous said the Prime Minister should resign as its in the best interests of the country.Peter Aldous has become the latest Tory MP to publicly call on Boris Johnson to resign Image: PAByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Feb |commentsThe tenth Tory MP has publicly called for Boris Johnson to resign in the best interests of the country as the Prime Minister continues to battle to save his premiership. Peter Aldous, who has represented the Suffolk constituency since , said he has come to the decision after a great deal of soul-searching. Mr Aldous has sent a letter of no confidence to the  Committee. Mr Johnson faced this call to quit as he travelled to Ukraine to hold crisis talks on how the UK will bolster the nationaposs defence against potential Russian aggression. In the Commons yesterday, Tory grandee Andrew Mitchell told the PM he no longer enjoys my support. Expressing his concerns, Mr Aldous said on Twitter : After a great deal of soul-searching, I have reached the conclusion that the Prime Minister should resign. It is clear that he has no intention of doing so and I have therefore written to the Chairman of the  Committee of Backbench Conservative MPs, advising him that. have no confidence in the Prime Minister as Leader of the Conservative Party.I have never taken such action before and had hoped that I would not be put in such an invidious position. Whilst I am conscious that others will disagree with me, I believe that this is in the best interests of the country, the Government and the Conservative Party. When askedthe PM was worried about another Tory MP calling for his resignation, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: “You have seen the Prime Minister seek to address the concerns of MPs in the House for a number of hours yesterday, so I can point you back to those comments. “Obviously at the moment he is in Ukraine, focused on the challenges there.”It comes as Downing Street made a dramatic U-turn and confirmed they will revealthe PM has been given a fine for breaching lockdown rules.Previously Number  refused to commit to telling the publicthe PM was given a fixed penalty notice.

It isnt Image: Getty ImagesopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsWell. The Prime Minister is under direct criminal investigation. The evidence of his alleged crimes are being kept hidden from him for fear of interference.And with war brewing on Europeaposs eastern flank, the PM told the enemy he didnapost have time to ring, because he had too much arse-covering to do.The Conservative Party is like an abused we with no other home to go to, and in two minds, not about whether this is acceptable, but whether itaposs survivable. And like every victim, it has yet to realisethataposs the question, then itaposs time to go.  Yesterday, a report he resisted ordering was not published. Instead, there was an aposupdateapos on the alleged criminality of his office, his staff, and his personal residence, and the PM greeted it in the same way he has every Mirror front page, ITV broadcast, and BBC breaking news update since late November: a burst of surprise and contrition with a half-le of . seconds, decaying into toxic belligerence that will linger in the bone for a thousand years. Events for which there was not enough evidence to merit an investigation by the politan Police had, in the space of a month, uncovered  witnesses,  photographs, and  pieces of paper.Despite the insufficient evidence,  out of  parties, on  dates, have met the evidential threshold for an investigation, on the grounds that those involved knew they were against the rules, there was no reasonable justication for them, and not looking into it would end Cressida Dickaposs career quicker than sending the riot squad into a candlelit vigil.One of them is an alleged gathering in the Downing Street flat on November , , which Mrs Johnsonaposs personal spokeswoman has repeatedly insisted is total nonsense, but about which there seems to be enough evidence to merit weeks of attention by an entire squad of coppers.  While the -page report has been subbed down to just , it contains all the facts needed to decide the PMaposs future. Extensive, substantive, factual information is now available, wrote Sue Gray. There were failures of leadership and judgement. There was excessive consumption of alcohol. There was no way for those working in government to stop it breaking the law. There was a serious failure to observe, not just the standards expected of those working at the heart of government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.The killer line is in paragraph . The excuse of long hours worked in the pandemic, in a building that could not be entirely Covid-secure, was destroyed. Those challenges... also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health... criminal sanctions were applied to many... the hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Governmentaposs regulations and guidance are known only too well. Every citizen has been impacted by the pandemic. One of them is Leshie Chandrapala. Her dad drove a bus. He died of Covid, and Leshie was not allowed to be with him as he lay in a coma in ICU. She believes he died because he didnapost get PPE at work, but the government hasnapost even written a letter of condolence to her family. A fortnight after he died, and while she grieved, they threw the BYO booze Downing Street garden party. The PMaposs response to the report was to say sorry for the way itaposs been handled, not sorry for doing it. And he has a solution. I know what the issue is, he declared. I get it, and I will fix it! He says he is taking personal charge, and setting up the Office of the Prime Minister. So who was in charge of his office for the past three years  Where is the drunken boozehound who careered around Downing Street Friday night drinkathons, encouraging staffers to let off steam with a long chug on the vodka bottle  Who allowed the culture of recklessness and lawlessness, at the heart of a government that was criminalising the same sins in others  Which leader has led his party to a disgrace worse than Windrush or Grenfell or Orgreave Bring me his head! bellows Boris from the Despatch Box. I will slay this beast, the same way that I would have slain Jimmy Savile,only I didnapost think that investigating historical sex abuse was money spaffed up the wall!Other things he has taken personal control of include Brexit, social care, test and trace, the energy crisis, the ministerial code of conduct, the saving of Owen Paterson, and funding for his gold wallpaper. The fact he took personal control of the vaccines may have something to do with the fact that  million people donapost want them. How many times has he taken charge, only for things to spin out of control  How many times has he shaken up the civil service, only to be rattled himself  Read more The nation is now watching the Conservative Party the same way as the rest of the street watches a victim get out of the police car, andto their abuser. They drag with them a whole country into this deranged, gnarled, unhappy misgovernment, back to the man who wonapost promise to publish the full truth in the House of Commons, where he might be held in contempthe failed to, but will promise it in the bar, to the MPs he has lied to for years, and who have been brainwashed into thinking such a promise is a concession rather than a repetition.Meanwhile the PM only appears in public when the public can be kept away from him. Abba tribute bands are raising their prices for satin satire. Andyou want a three-word slogan to describe where we are, it is simply: another fine mess. The PM or his we may get a fixed penalty notice pictures may or may not emerge. He may be out on his ear, or he may convince enough MPs to give him one more go. Itaposs irrelevant, because the fallout of this radioactive scandal will last to the ballot box and beyond it reaches into homes and hearts, to the guts and spines of millions to whom the words aposToryapos and aposPartyapos are now as repugnant as the fact that people like Leshie had their pain doubled and then dismissed by a man whose charm has long since been spent. The Tories got drunk on power, picked a man who can be fooled by a cake, and then dithered about whether to let him keep hurting the rest of us.

And Nicoles doing everything in her power to make sure she succeedsNicole and Penny have an incredibly close bond Image: Nicole GoldByJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsNicole Gold knew her daughter Penny was destined for fame when she was just a toddler - slipping into her mum’s high heels and tottering around. “From the time she could toddle she was in my shoes,” Nicole, , told The Mirror. “She was picking up my microphones too.” Nicole, who records her own music and performs at festivals, had grand plans for her daughter from birth - getting Penny a baby acting agent at the age of three months old. “She did a Fairy commercial and a couple of campaigns and photoshoots when she was really young,” Nicole, from Colchester, Essex, explained. Surrounded by the commotion of a TV crew and set, Penny barely batted an eyelid - signalling she was meant to be in front of a camera. Reflecting on her own childhood, musical Nicole, from Colchester, Essex, regrets that she didn’t go to stage school at a young age - waiting until she was older to put herself through a performing arts course. “I’d have loved itmy parents had pushed me into stage school. It would have been a lot easier to get into it,” she said. So when the mum-of-one fell pregnant, she decided she was going to push her daughter into singing, acting and dancing to take up the opportunities she felt she missed out on as a kid.  Penny, now six, takes on around  hours of activities every week that will prepare her for a career in showbiz - meaning dedicated mum Nicole spends her week ferrying her daughter to and from classes. “It’s a juggling act,” Nicole said. “But I’m training her for what she wants to do.” Penny’s jam-packed week begins with gymnastics on Monday, followed by Latin Ballroom lessons on Tuesday, circus school on Wednesday, and performing arts and musical theatre school on Saturday. She wakes up at around .am every day and Nicole aims to have her in bed by .pm so she can get plenty of rest for the busy day ahead. To fund the array of extra-curricular activities Penny takes part in, Nicole runs her own beauty business - dropping Penny off at her grandma’s house on Fridays so she can see clients. In keeping with her glamorous education, Nicole homeschools Penny, giving her singing lessons using YouTube videos and practising reading by rehearsing scripts. “I try to make it fun. To be honest, kids learn more when everything’s fun so I try to make it more into a bit of a game,” Nicole explained. She added she’d always considered homeschooling Penny but decided to send her to school shortly before the pandemic began. Then, when schools closed and all parents were forced to homeschool their kids, Nicole thought it would be best to carry on home education after classrooms welcomed pupils back. Are you a apospushy parentapos  We would love to hear from you. Email jessica.taylor@reachplc.  “She loves it - she’s got more friends than when she went to normal school. Where we live there’s a massive homeschooling community,” Nicole said. As she teaches Penny more about le and fame, Nicole is starting to see her daughter’s natural talents as she excels. “I’d like her to go into music but I can see her acting more when she grows up. She has a right little flair for dferent characters.” Nicole acknowledges she’s a “pushy” mum but believes her approach to parenting will encourage Penny to follow her dream and give it her all. “First and foremost I want her to be happy and the best she can be. If her best means she doesn’t make it, then that’s ok - as long as she’s done everything to the best of her ability,” she explained. “If Penny decides one day that she wants to go and be a vet, that’s ok too, as long as she gives it %.” However, she reckons her daughter’s love of performing arts will continue to flourish and propel her to fame as she grows up. Nicole said: “Someone asked her yesterday, ‘what do you want to be when you grow up’  Penny replied, ‘a rockstar’!” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationLovePregnancySchoolsParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The source told The Times: “A bit like supermarkets, we’ll almost certainly keep the same policy until it is safe to move.“For example, the rules in the US are very clear on masks. It would be ridiculous of us to ask passengers to put them on when we enter their airspace.” A second source added that although there are “hopes that one day we will have a world with no masks, they are going to be with us for a long time”. Each airline has its own policy regarding rules for face masks, and what proof may be required from passengers who are exempt for medical reasons from wearing a face covering while in the plane cabin.  Ryanair’s chief financial officer Neil Sorahan says masks will remain - just like rules on passengers removing liquids from hand luggage at security. “Masks will be something that will be with us for a while longer to come,” he said. “If that is the price we have to pay for the next few months, into summer — it’s a small price to pay.” Another senior aviation source said: Until there is a harmonised lting of mask mandates on flights by governments worldwide it is simpler for airlines to keep the rules in place. Virgin Atlantic told Sky News in a statement: We continue to input to the regulators and work together across industry to see when changes can be made, however until further notice, we will require all customers and crew to continue to wear face masks for the duration of their flights, as well as at the airports.

This will not be tolerated.Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcallingImage: Getty Images AlloyopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Feb |commentsIt probably seems like a small thing, at best. At worst, a waste of time and resources. It’s not though. It’s important. A tiny triumph. A baby step in the right direction. Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcalling – “targeting people who are shouting things from their vehicles at women girls. This will not be tolerated.” Last week they stopped a van after the occupant yelled at some women who turned out to be plain-clothed police officers. Oh to have seen his face. He was reported for a breach of the Public Spaces Protection Order and is likely to be issued with a £ fine or taken to court, which is another way of saying that he was left in no doubt that THIS IS NOT OK. That’s apparently what men need to be told, reminded of, in no uncertain terms, so they’re one hundred per cent clear. No, it’s not just a bit of harmless fun that we need to lighten up about. It’s horrendous. Scary. Humiliating.  Maybe this concept is confusing because we’re living in an age of sharing, honesty, and talking about everything. Mostly that’s great, but somewhere within this, a simple truth has got lost. Sometimes, it’s good NOT to talk. Sometimes, you need to shut the hell up. Perhaps we need a massive advertising campaign, public service announcement telly commercials and posters everywhere to clearly inform everyone once and for all: Stop telling women what you think of their bodies. Especially when they haven’t asked, which is pretty much always. There are no Thought Police – anyone is free to think whatever they like. The opinions inside someone’s head can’t hurt anyone . The problem comes when they’re broadcast out loud to the woman you’re thinking them about, be it on the street, online, or on a radio show, like that fool who talked about Strictly’s Tilly Ramsay. What you think of the woman’s body is irrelevant, by the way. Evenyou believe it’s a compliment, still keep it to yourself. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but most women do not feel flattered and delighted when a stranger gives them positive feedback about a body part. We feel embarrassed, and frightened. And we’re taught to ignore this behaviour – apart from in Bradford, it’s up to us to deal with it ourselves – to put our heads down, walk quicker, in case the situation escalates.We’re luckywe are only verbally harassed. Even online, where the threat of physical violence is removed, these kind of comments are dangerous, and unacceptable. They perpetuate the belief that women’s appearances are fair game for discussion and debate. That our bodies are anyone’s business but our own. They also ensure that the practice of speaking about women in this way seeps down to future generations, continuing the cycle. It has to stop. As the fight to make our streets safer for women goes on, catcalling being taken seriously in one city in the UK is just a drop in the ocean. But at least it’s a start. Maybe those TV ads aren’t a bad idea – and it’s obvious what music they should be set to. Ronan Keating, You Say It Best, When You Say Nothing At All.

Posting on the restaurantaposs Instagram page, the boss gave their former customers an ultimatum - pay up or they will go to the police and release CCTV images of them online.In the post, they said: Unfortunately tonight we have had a party of  leave an unpaid bill of over £.

We are an independently run business with a small team and we work hard to get where we are and we deserve better than this. Front of house worker Christina, who helped to serve the group on Saturday night, said the booking had originally been made for  people. However, when  of them arrived, staff moved tables and chairs to accommodate the extra numbers. The -year-old said: We are a very small independent business. We turned people away for them because we didnapost have room…” “So weaposve lost paying customers as well as losing £. When the bill arrived, Christina said four men from the group came to the counter to pay rather than waiting at their table for it to be brought to them. In the meantime, the rest of the party left the restaurant and got into cars outside. When theyaposve asked for the bill theyaposve seen the price of it, theyaposve proceeded to barter the price of the bill down saying theyaposre not paying that,” Christina said. Everything off their plates was gone. There was no food left over, they sent nothing back. Itaposs only upon paying the bill that the issue happens. I said aposyou donapost need a cash machine, we take card paymentsapos and as I turned around to direct him back into the restaurant he jumps in a car and he makes his exit. Christina said the man called the restaurant after he left last night to apologise and said he wouldto the restaurant at .am this morning with the money for the bill. However, it seemed to be an empty promise, with the man having never turned up. We feel really deflated, we work extremely hard,” Christina added. Itaposs called hospitality for a reason. We want you to come in, we want you to have a nice time. If thereaposs a problem we want to fix it but when we have tables like that it affects the rest of the restaurant and the rest of our customers who are trying to have a nice time. She wanted to send the message to the customers that there would be “no judgement”they decided to pay up now. “We are giving them the benefit of the doubt to collect that money and come and pay us because we deserve to be paid for the meals and the food. We donapost care about tips, we just want what is owed to us. No one is going to shout at them, no one is going to get them in trouble.

Most of the officers investigated were police constables and based at Charing Cross Station, according to the Independent Office for Police Conduct , leading to a number of recommendations in a report. In one disgusting chat two officers talk about hitting their female partners before blaming women in general for getting murdered by men.  It read: Officer : “I f**ing need to take my bird out, won’t see her until next Saturday. Then I have to work. Promised to take her out the Friday after. Making it up to her from when I backhanded her. Officer : “Grab her by the pussy.” Officer : “You ever slapped your missus  It makes them love you more. Seriously since I did that she won’t leave me alone. Now I know why these daft c**ts are getting murdered by their sp****c boyfriends. Knock a bird about and she will love you. Human nature. They are biologically programmed to like that shit.” Officer : “Lmao. Officer : “I’m right though.”  In another exchange a male officer sent a string of messages to a female colleague: “I would happily rape you.” “If I was single I would actually hate fuck you. “If I was single I would happily chloroform you.”One police officer was even referred to as “Mcrapey Raperson” in a WhatsApp exchange.The report noted that not all the police officers in the team shared these views, but they also found evidence that police officers were afraid of speaking out. Those who did were harassed, humiliated and excluded, with women told should “play the game or stay quiet”, or leave. The report also shows officers used homophobic language and shared a number of racist messages including references to African children, Somali people and Auschwitz that are too offensive to print. Responding to the report Home Secretary Priti Patel said: “Being a police officer is a privilege which has been abused by these sickening officers.“It has been clear for some time that there are problems with the culture of the politan Police, which is why last year I tasked the Angiolini Inquiry and the police inspectorate with investigating these deeply concerning issues. “I expect the politan Police and the Mayor of London to implement the recommendations of this report as soon as practically possible. The public rightly expects the behaviour of the police to be beyond reproach - standards must be raised.” Of the  officers investigated, two were dismissed for gross misconduct, two resigned and several face disciplinary action Nine are still serving in the force.

Her father George VI died suddenly on February , , and she became the monarch at the age of just .Throughout nearly all of her long reign, her beloved husband Prince Philip was at her side helping her to navigate le as Queen until his death aged  last year.Upon marrying the then Princess Elizabeth in , Philip gave up his Greek and Danish royal titles and was bestowed the title of Duke of Edinburgh. However, he was never King - even though his we was the Queen - and the reason for this is due to an old patriarchal system, where Kings outrank Queens.  If he had the title of King, he would have been a higher rank than the Queen - which would not have been allowed as he married into the royal family rather than being born into it.However, the rules mean it will be a dferent story when Prince William becomes King one day with the Duchess of Cambridge by his side.Itaposs likely that Kate will become Queen Consort, and itaposs likely that she will opt to be Queen Catherine.

Like Philip, as she wasnapost born into the royal family she can never be Queen in her own right but she can take the aposConsortapos role - which is what many wives have done in the past. King George VIaposs we became Queen Elizabeth, before becoming better known as The Queen Mother after the Kingaposs death. Explaining the role, royal expert Marlene Koenig said: Catherineaposs role will certainly change as she will be the consort of the sovereign. There is no real constitutional role for a consort, just by tradition.  “She will be the first lady of the land, in terms of precedence.However, before becoming Queen, itaposs likely that Kate will be given yet another new title.When Prince Charles becomes King, William will become the heir to the throne and will probably take on the title The Prince of Wales.It is not a given that William will get the title, as it has to be bestowed upon the heir by the monarch. However, experts predict it is more than likely that Charles will pass on his title to William.  If this happens, Kate would automatically become the Princess of Wales. The last person to hold this title was, of course, Williamaposs late mother Princess Diana. Charlesaposs second we, Camilla, decided against using the title out of respect for Diana.And according to a source,and when this is to happen, it would be an emotional moment for William.They told the: I’m sure it’ll be a bit of a bittersweet moment.This is her son and his we, so in some ways, it will be coming full circle—but it will also be a poignant reminder of what we all lost.

Then it clicked it was from Squid Game. As he was heading towards the city centre I just thought he was probably heading to a stag do or something. The stag do theory would make sense, as dressing as comical or current characters is often part of the culture, but one or two things possibly rule it out. Firstly, the inidual was alone, and were he on a stag you might expect him to be with others in similar attire. Secondly, CoventryLive understands someone dressed in the same outfit has been spotted several times around the city on dferent days. For the uninitiated, Squid Game is a fictional drama series which sees contestants play a host of childrenaposs games in an attempt to be the overall winner and scoop a huge prize - but those who donapost win, die. It was released in September and quickly become wildly popular, particularly on social media where it created a huge amount of memes and gs. It became so ingrained in culture children have been known to play Squid Game on school playgrounds during breaks.The red outfit the inidual seen in Coventry is wearing is that of Squid Game aposguardsapos also known as Pink Soldiers or Masked Men, according to Squid-Game.fandom.The sighting comes after a man wearing a creepy clown costume was seen walking the streets of Speke, Merseyside, at night. The man was seen crouching behind bushes outside homes while dressed in the frightening costume which was complete with an oversized mask.A witness snapped a photo of the clown, the Liverpool Echo reported.His costume was made up of a black and white clown suit with a white neck ruff and a garish mask that featured a bright red nose, purple hair and giant teeth.

Kasim, , said the family are desperate for police to bring whoever was responsible to justice.He told BirminghamLive : Within a matter of seconds she was walking from one block to another block when she was brutally attacked. It happened before I got to her. She was in my arms. I think I felt her heart beating. I think she took her last breath with me.” He added: I heard there was banging outside. Two people banging my next door neighbour’s door and they come banging on my door saying: ‘Your sister, your sister.’ “I’d gone out, panicking, opened the door, and she was there and not responding. She wasnapost able to say who it was or what happened. Paying tribute, he added: We were really close. I can’t put it into words. She was my only sister.  “She was a great mum and an amazing auntie.” Marina’s mother released a tribute via police.

Snapped from a road in Leicester, the photo shows East Park Road in North Evington, a deep orange and almost red sunset. A silver line streaking through the middle of the sky can also be made out.The photo was taken at pm on Sunday, January , which just happened to be the same night that a fireball meteor was spotted blazing across the night sky in the UK, reports the Leicester Mercury. There were more than  reported sightings of the meteor on Saturday evening - however, most were slightly later in the day, at around pm. As well as in the UK, the meteor was also spotted across Europe as it made its way across the sky.The UK Meteor Network confirmed the sighting on Twitter, saying: The fireball... was a Sporadic type with an interesting orbit, in perihelion itaposs inside Mercuryaposs orbit.Went down to km but no meteorite. It was described a leaving a green and blue trail as it entered the Earthaposs atmosphere. Twitter user @SydneyEggbert said: Caught it on my Teslacam last night, driving North on the M near Birmingham.It was spotted in Wakefield, Yorkshire, according to Yorkshire Live, as well as across north Wales and Scotland.But due to the slightly earlier timing of the Leicester photograph, there is uncertainty as to what caused it. It could be a lens flare from a nearby streetlight, a flaming meteor, or something completely dferent altogether.

Lauren Grfiths was driving home from work to Ammanford in South Wales in her Range Rover Velar when the vehicle lost power all of a sudden. The -year-old managed to park the £k car outside her home in Llwyngwern, Hendy, near Swansea.But it then burst into flames right next to her three-storey home, reports The Sun.The foot health specialist did manage to rush away from the burning vehicle but the flames quickly spread to her home and her neighboursapos homes. Three fire engines spent two and a half hours fighting the fire as it spread through Laurenaposs home.The mum told the Sun: There were blue sparks coming from the grill and quite a bit of smoke, it was terrying. “I wasn’t able to switch the engine off either. I was pressing the start stop button and nothing was happening and there was a loud banging from underneath the bonnet.  Panicking, Lauren grabbed her two sons and ran into the garden of her house as she called . Then a passerby helped the family into another nearby garden where they could keep away from the fire. Lauren described how all the neighbours ran out into the garden and everyone watched shocked as the Range Rover exploded.  She said it was like a bomb had gone off as there was debris everywhere. That was when firefighters arrived on the scene to tackle the blaze. Lauren has claimed Range Rover wonapost take liability for the car because it was two months over its warranty. She added that she has gone to Land Rover for everything, from the caraposs MOT and wear and tear issues to even the oil top ups.  And everything was fine after its MOT which only happened in November. The Mirror has contacted Jaguar Land Rover for a comment. Laurenaposs landlord said her home is now a health and safety risk and she cannot salvage anything from inside, including her sonaposs first hair and teeth.  A Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: On attendance, crews were confronted with a car fire that had spread to a semi-detached property and was well alight. Firefighters extinguished the fire using four breathing apparatus, two hose reel jets, two thermal imaging cameras and a short extension ladder. The fire had destroyed the vehicle and had caused fire and smoke damage throughout the property. Neighbouring properties had also suffered heat damage from the fire. The Police and Western Power were also in attendance. The Fire Service ventilated the property, using a positive pressure ventilation fan, and left the incident at :pm. The cause of the fire is believed to be accidental. A Land Rover spokesman told The Sun: Customer safety is our highest priority. We are aware of the incident and we sympathise with Ms Grfiths’ experience, the cause of which is yet to be determined. We have duly offered mobility to the customer and are willing to support an investigation by the insurer – the process for which, requires the insurer to investigate first, to avoid any adverse effect on Ms Grfiths’ home and vehicle insurance policies.

His funeral, attended by the young Queen, was the first to be televisedWeston-super-Mare in Somerset in  Image: SSPL via Getty ImagesByPaul Routledge:,  Feb |commentsBritain in  was a black and white world, in every way. There was no colour in the newspapers, no iety in the food we ate, no dazzling dresses and no arguing with your parents. I was a happy little eight-year-old boy attending All Saints Primary in Normanton, west Yorkshire, and we-to-be Lynne was six, a pupil in Christ Church infants’ in Wakefield.We knew nothing of the world beyond the garden gate, but that blissful ignorance was broken by the thunderclap announcement that King George VI had died.Mrs R recalls that a vicar came into the classroom, whispered something to the teacher, who then gave the doleful news. “Everyone burst into tears, so I did, too.”  This tragedy burst on a nation still recovering from a World War that cost almost half a million lives, military and civilian. Whole stretches of our great cities were bomb sites.But spirits were reviving. War hero Winston Churchill was back in No, and the BBC was belting out morale-raising Workers’ Playtime on the radio at lunchtime three days a week.Unemployment was virtually unknown, at .%. Most boys and girls left school at , and went to work in industry, commerce or shops. A small number passed the -plus to attend grammar school, and an even smaller number went to university. This was then still the workshop of the world. We drove British cars, motor cycles, vans, lorries and tractors, we listened to British radios and gramophones, we wore British-made clothes, flewin British aeroplanes and travelled on trainspulled by the latest British steam engines. The Welfare State was in its infancy, but we had the NHS, which saved millions from illness, we had child welfare, free school milk and family allowances.Father – usually the breadwinner – had two weeks’ paid holiday a year. Central heating in the home was unheard of. We had lovely coal fires. It wasn’t such a bad place to live, despite the continuation of wartime rationing. Every family had ration books with coupons to exchange for goods. Though we didn’t know it, we were poised to enter a new Elizabethan Age. It was February  when it was announced the King had died at Sandringham. His illness had been kept quiet, and the nation was shocked. His body lay in state in Westminster Hall for a week, and , people filed past his coffin, queuing up to four miles to pay their last respects.  His funeral, attended by the young Queen, was the first to be televised, leading to a run on the shops for TV sets. Her Coronation, broadcast live the next year, confirmed the trend to mass ownership. Before then, we had to be content with monochrome newspapers, plus newsreels like Pathe News, also black and white, with patriotic music, shown in cinemas long after the events they depicted. Television was still a novelty in , tiny nine-inch black and white screens. Nobody in my street had one. There was no commercial broadcasting in the UK, though young people strained to hear “pop music” on Radio Luxembourg. The BBC was still content to schedule Mantovani and his Strings. For public entertainment, there was dancing, the “flicks”, theatre and live music recitals. Pop festivals were way into the future. Many marriages were madein Mecca Locarno dance halls. The cinema was a huge attraction. Even small towns like Normanton had three, and they were often packed out.  was the year of High Noon and Gary Cooper, and Singin’ In The Rain with Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby were making their wise-cracking Road To... films, and John Wayne starred in the romantic comedy The Quiet Man, a title later disastrously stolen by Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.But the most popular film here was the circus drama The Greatest Show On Earth, filmed in Technicolour and starring Cornel Wilde and Betty Hutton as trapeze artists and Charlton Heston as the ringmaster. Thirteen million tickets were sold, though many probably saw it twice. It featured real acts and hundreds of exotic animals. It could not be made today. The first singles chart was published by the New Musical Express, and the No was Al Martino’s Here In My Heart. These were the days of the crooner, such as Johnny “All of Me” Ray and Frankie “Christmas Roses” Laine. It was all very traditional stuff, but a revolution was on the horizon.  was the year Bill Haley  His Comets, started the rock ’n’ roll journey. But the main social hub was the pub. Beer cost ninepence [less than p] a pint, and it is what everyone drank, not lager or wine. They’d have thought Spritzer was a horse in the . at Wetherby, and Prosecco a hymn. Working men’s clubs did a roaring trade. The beer was cheaper, but women were often banned, except on concert nights . Clubs were the nurseries for singers and comedian, though the Saturday night audiences could be tough. Raucous shouts of “Gerrimoff!” frustrated many a talent. The clubs also ran day trips to the seaside for kids and families, and Christmas treats for pensioners. They were a vital,under-rated, part of the social fabric.  Children made their own fun. We played out in the street, the parks and the fields – even on bomb sites – from dawn till dusk, without the fears that plague today’s generation, until we were shouted in for their supper. We were in an out of each others’ houses, back doors usually open, and mental health problems did not figure on the radar. It seemed like a long, hot summer that would never end. There were no smartphones, no computer games, in fact no computers. Few kids had their own bedroom to which they could retreat with electronic gizmos. And no social media, the  for cyber-bullying.  Officially, sex had not yet been invented, but it was practised universally. Relationships were not taught in schools, only in the playground, and we found the kit was self-explanatory. Pregnancy outside marriage was frowned upon, and many young couples “had to get married”. Single families were rare, one poignant exception being war widows.Homosexuality was illegal, and gay men were still being prosecuted. Pornography was also unlawful, the preserve of the wealthy. Food was basic, almost a continuation of the wartime diet. It made for a slimmer, more healthy population, but it was grey. There were no ready meals, or frozen burgers. Meat and two veg was the staple dinner. Few people ate out. School dinners, costing a shilling a day , were basics such as shepherd’s pie.  Church attendance was much greater than today, and chapels still rang with Wesley’s great hymns. Anglican and Catholic faiths competed for the best Whitsun walks. It was a quieter, gentler time. Few people had cars – none in our street. We walked or cycled or took the bus, tram or train. We queued, and heaven help the “jumper”. With the most horrible conflict the world has known behind us, it was enough to get on with a peaceful le: food on the table, steady job, council houseyou were lucky, and a week’s holiday in Scarborough or Blackpool.  An excellent sufficiency, as my father, home after six years’ war service, used to say. Alas, it was not for everyone. Regulars and National Servicemen were fighting Communist forces in Korea in the “unknown war”. A new Elizabethan era was rising, but the old one was dying hard.

Since stepping down as a senior working royal and moving to America with we Meghan Markle, Harry has made several claims against his family. In March last year, he and Meghan sat down for a bombshell chat with Oprah Winfrey, where they alleged there had been conversations about how dark their son Archieaposs skin would be before he was born. Harry also revealed a rt between him and his brother, Prince William and he told how he felt really let down by his father, Prince Charles, and had been cut off financially by the royals. He also lashed out at Charles on the Armchair Expert podcast and the Apple series The Me You Canapost See.But with Harryaposs beloved grandmother the Queen suffering health issues last year and her Platinum Jubilee celebrations coming up, royal expert Katie Nicholl says he will try to keep things calmer. Katie told Closer magazine : Whether Harry has regrets or not, I don’t know, but what I do know is that he has a history of lashing out at the establishment before.

And he’s realised how much last year took a toll on his grandmother, and doesn’t want to cause any more upset, so is laying low for now. There has been speculation Harry and Meghan couldto the UK for the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June. Since leaving for America, Harry has ed to the UK twice - for Prince Philipaposs funeral and to unveil a statue of his late mother son ArchieMeghan has yet towith son Archie, while daughter Lilibet, was born in America and has never been to England. Last month, royal sources revealed Charles has offered an olive branch to Harry by inviting his family to stay with him when they next visit the UK.However, it then emerged that Harry claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Harry, , has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court.

You will be keen to take on new challenges as these arise and develop your own knowledge and skills.” But anyone who wants to apply to be a housekeeper for the Queen has to pass a secret test first, to set the special cleaners from the bunch. According to Tracey Waterman, the head of recruitment, the team sets a secret challenge to all interviewees to see how they react - and those that pass, get the job.  The premise behind it, she explains, is that she will place a dead fly somewhere around the room to seethe candidate notices it and how they dispose of it. Speaking during Channel aposs documentary Sandringham: The Royals at Christmas, she said: The dference between a housekeeper in a five-star hotel and in a royal Palace would be attention to detail. One of the tests I like to do, to seea candidate has a potential eye for detail, is to place a dead fly, either in the fireplace or on the carpet. Once the dead fly is placed, I then bring the candidate into the room. I lead them into the room quite slowly, just giving them a chance to glance at the room, have a little look at what we’ve got inside the room. Bringing them to the fireplace, maybe highlighting that we’ve got a beautul fireplace. It’s this hint that Tracey hopes will make them aware of the dead fly. But it’s not just about spotting the fly she says but what they dothey do notice it. She adds: It’s a great test, maybe out of  people half the candidates will notice the fly. One out of ten will actually bend down and pick it up, that’s the special housekeeper.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Following the birth of her triplets, Charity Horton,  believed her we was plotting with her mother-in-law and planned to drug her during the horrying ordeal. The doting mum became so stricken with terror that she once tried to put her foot in scalding water to seeshe could feel the pain and disappeared after telling her family that she planned to take her own le.Thankfully after ing home, she was admitted to hospital on April  and ed to we Sarah,  and triplets Raine, Poppy and River on May  following support. She said: “It was like I’d gone schizophrenic overnight. Even when I started sleeping I was obsessing over things.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here I kept thinking people were testing me to seeI could cope. I thought my we and her mother were watching me on the baby monitor to seeI made mistakes. “I thought they were hiding my medicine so they could drug me to make me stop talking. I was obsessively askingit was time to feed the babies, and how much they would need at their next feed, just repeating the same questions over and over. “Then all the hallucinating and obsessing about birds in the garden started. If I saw only one magpie in the garden I would obsess that something bad was going to happen to the babies, and Iaposd chase around the garden trying to find all its friends. “I’d be really gladI saw a robin in the garden and follow it about because when my we sees a robin she says it’s her dad who died, but I obsessed over them.  “I had a hallucination of my we carrying a bag down the side of our house, but I can’t have seen that, because I was sitting on the sofa with a wall in front of me. “I did a similar thing with my friend’s car, which I thought I saw, but it wasn’t there when I looked again.” Charity became pregnant following articial insemination in August , and along with we Sarah, an HGV driver was over the moon. The wives used a sperm donor from Denmark, and Charity had intra-uterine injections because of suspected polycystic oies she said. The mums-to-be were delighted when three little ones were spotted on the seven-week scan: each with their own amniotic sack and placenta, on March , .The babes, each weighing four pounds, were born by planned caesarean section after a -week uncomplicated pregnancy. The girls were strong enough to stay in the main hospital with mum, resting in special hot-cots, and fed via nasal-gastro tubes. The new mums cuddled and burped their tots, and changed many tiny nappies, before bringing their family home on April . But Charity Horton, , struggled to relax after babies Raine, Poppy and River were born, and once she got home from hospital barely slept for an entire week. Soon she became very ill and was convinced she was starving her tiny babies - even though the trio were perfectly healthy. And she believed her mother-in-law Cheryl Horton, , and we were hiding her medication, and that Cherylaposs dog was going to eat the babies. In the following weeks, her mental health spiralled, and she started to hallucinate thinking she could see through the walls. Convinced that magpies in her garden were a sign of bad luck, sheaposd chase them out the garden of their home in St Austell, Cornwall. Doctors initially prescribed the exhausted mum antidepressants and sleeping pills, but the depleted woman couldn’t find peace. Frightened Charity began to self-harm and take risks with her le. The troubled mum once tried to put her foot in scalding water to seeshe could feel the pain.  In a cry for help, she told her we she was going to take her own le, and disappeared, on April . Loved-ones including mum Joy Ternouth , was worried sick, she said. The family called the mental-health nurses and Charity, who ed home the same night, was admitted to Longreach mental health acute psychiatric ward on April . The mum was given support and a six-month course of antipsychotic drugs and was well enough tohome to her we and babies on May . After two weeks of in-patient treatment, she was on the road to recovery and able tohome. She spoke up about her experience to help other mums going through the same thing. Charity, a CCTV manager, said: “At first I didnapost think there was anything wrong I just thought I was high on le after having these three beautul girls. “Then we got home and I was so frightened of having to look after them. I was sure I was doing it wrong. “I convinced myself I had to feed them all at once. I couldn’t switch off or sleep at all. It was like I was wired. I could hear them all the time, and they always sounded really loud. “I feared they would die in their sleep, so when they were quiet I thought they were dead. Whenever they were awake I thought they needed something all the time. “I didn’t stop talking, I just kept repeating the same questions to my we and her mum all the time. It just got worse and worse, until I wanted to kill myself because I was in so much pain. “I just wanted the anxiety to stop. Looking back now it seems so scary. I just canapost believe that happened. It’s brilliant being a new mum now - I love it. “I’m really embracing it and making up for the lost time. I just laugh and play with them a lot and get them to smile. I’m so glad Iaposve got through it. “At leastmy girls go through mental health problems I’ll know how to help.” After a month, brave Charity confessed she was having thoughts about self-harm and was admitted to hospital, where she was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. She said: I knew there was something wrong but not what it was.  “I desperately needed help. I threatened to hurt and then kill myself because I was hoping somebody would realise that I wasnapost me and that I was in this horrible place. “I just wanted to feel like myself again. I was glad to pack my bags - it was the right place for me. “I was too in my own head to worry about leaving the babies, I just need to get better. “After nine days I started really missing them so I knew I was getting better. They’re not quite sure why postpartum psychosis happens, about one in a thousand women get it, and it’s triggered by birth. “I imagine it’s the perfect storm of all the hormones of being a new mum, the stress, and being so tired. It’s a medical emergency -somebody gets it you need to ring an ambulance it’s that bad. “It’s rare, but be on the lookout for your family and friends just be aware of what can happen. One minute you seem fine but the next you don’t know what’s going on.” If you are suffering from postnatal depression, donapost struggle in silence. PANDAS is a charity dedicated to helping people.

Filling the gap with glue to hold it firm, she says she has no regrets about her spot of self-dentistry.She says her local dentist closed before the pandemic and has had trouble finding one since. After trying to get an NHS dentist appointment, she took matters into her own hands and applied the treatment in her living room. Mrs Sheen, who suffers from gum disease, said one of her teeth had started to come loose - and went online to come up with a plan to make things better. Two years on, she says she doesnapost regret a thing. She explained: I have bleeding gums every time I clean my teeth and it’s making me not want to clean them as I hate the taste of blood and all my teeth are getting wobbly. One in front was so wobbly it had to come out as I couldn’t eat with it so I put Elastoplast on the end of the pliers and tugged it out. The only thing I could think of was melting glue and moulding it into the gap. It’s been two years now.  It’s working okay, I can actually smile without seeing a gap. NHS England recently announced they would provide an extra £ million for dentists to provide additional urgent care for NHS patients. The unprecedented backlog has left dentistry hanging by a thread with many dentists looking to change careers or seeking early retirement. On January  NHS England pledged an extra £ million for dentists to provide additional urgent care for NHS patients. Funding will be available until the end of March and will be paid on a sessional basis. “Any additional funding is long overdue recognition of the huge backlogs facing NHS dentistry” said General Dental Practice Committee Chair Shawn Charlwood. “After a decade of cuts a cash-starved service risks being offered money that can’t be spent. Hard-pressed practices are working against the clock, and many will struggle to find capacity ahead of April for this investment to make a dference. “Until today not a penny of the government’s multi-billion-pound catch-up programme had reached dentistry. This is progress but must be just the startwe are to rebuild a service millions depend on.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSDentist\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jess tipped the scales at  stone and one pound when she was at her heaviest. The support worker was a size  and she had spent years gorging on junk food after being trapped in an abusive relationship.She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia - a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body - and decided to get into shape. Through a combination of exercise and a low-fat diet, Jess lost an incredible  stone and four pounds in just one year. Jess is now a size  and weighs nine stone and nine pounds, and she says she now has about  pounds of excess skin, which swings whenever she walks.She is now hoping to fund an operation by setting up a GoFundMe page. Jess, from Bredon, Worcs., said: I still see myself as largely overweight due to the skin and it has got me down. I had thought of cutting the skin off myself. Iaposve lost all the weight through exercise and diet but I really need help to get the body I really want. At one point I was basically bed bound but I still exercised using arm and leg machines. Itaposs been really hard work but Iaposm so proud of what Iaposve achieved. Jess piled on the pounds after getting hooked on burgers and pizzas washed down with bottles of full-fat coke. Her health deteriorated so much her doctors told her lungs were being crushed under her own weight. Jess decided to make a change in January  and swapped fast food in for vegetables, rice and brown toast.  She said: I was basically eating from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep. I ate everything basically from chocolate to fast food to snacks. My illnesses meant I could hardly move, sometimes it was so bad I couldnapost even lt my head and my weight made it even worse. Even on my good days I couldnapost do much - so exercising along with my diet was a hard feat. But I did what I could.  I bought a foot pedal and I would sit on my sofa and pedal away for as long as I could. It would exhaust me and Iaposd crash out for the afternoon or the next day. As the weight started to slowly drop off I felt proud. It was working. Soon I had dropped a dress size and I started to feel more confident glancing at myself in the mirror.  Jess, who lives with partner James, , now hopes to raise enough money to pay a private clinic to have her saggy skin removed. She said: It causes a lot of discomfort. The skin can throw me off balanceit swings as I walk. Itaposs like carrying a heavy duvet around my middle. I have to wear waist trainers and shapewear all the time to hold it in place which is often painful and uncomfortable.Iaposve lost all the weight on my own and Iaposm determined to have the operation to remove the skin without being a burden on the NHS.The reason I put the weight on was because I was in an abusive relationship. I want to show people in similar situations that it is possible to change your le and lestyle. I just need a bit of help to get me where I want to be.

Courtney Lyn wanted a tattoo of Rocket the raccoon, a fictional character from the Marvel movie s of the Galaxy, on her arm.However, she was horried after realising part of the design looked more phallic than intended, DailyStar reports. She shared the video on TikTok, which has been viewed more than two million times, leaving many in stitches. The woman said in the video: It was supposed to be a knee cap. But it doesnapost look like a knee cap, it looks like a penis! She then shows the whole tattoo, showing Rocket holding a laser cannon while seemingly kneeling on the ground. Courtney showed off the reference photo, adding: Look at this knee cap in question, there is a line there. Hefollowed it correctly, unfortunately.

She also said the tattoo artist had worked on her previously – adding she was watching him doing the inking the whole time. However, it wasnapost until she went back home and saw the tattoo in the mirror that she saw it for what it was. Many TikTokers giggled as they made the same realisation.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools.

It will focus our minds next week.“The games in November were excellent in terms of seeing fans back when we arrived at the stadium, the noise they generated when we came on to the field and how they helped us through those games.

Pyongyang where he received cheers from audience members and artists who praised him for heralding a “new era” of national power, state media reported.The North’s official media has been highlighting Kim’s authoritarian leadership following a spree of missile tests in January, which some experts see as an attempt to pressure Washington over deadlocked nuclear negotiations after two years of pandemic border closures and economic decay.The Biden administration has called for the UN Security Council to meet on Thursday to discuss North Korea’s most recent test of an intermediate-range missile potentially capable of reaching Guam, a key US military hub in the Pacic.Sunday’s test signalled a resumption of major weapons testing that Mr Kim had suspended in  while initiating diplomacy with then-US president Donald Trump.Talks between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since the collapse of the second Kim-Trump meeting in , when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demands for a major release of crippling US-led sanctions in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The Korean Central News Agency said Mr Kim and his we, Ri Sol Ju, were greeted with “stormy cheers” after arriving at Pyongyang’s massive Mansudae Art Theatre for Tuesday’s concert.KCNA said the audience appreciated that Mr Kim was “ushering in on this land a new world and a new era when the people’s ideals and happiness and desire for building a powerful country are comprehensively translated into reality”.Artists performed songs and dances that demonstrated the “single-minded unity” of North Korean people and their devotion to build a socialist country “to be envied by the world”, the report said.North Korean TV showed Mr Kim galloping through a forest on a white horse – a symbol associated with his family’s dynastic rule over the country – in a new documentary praising his alleged accomplishments in , including anti-virus campaigns, construction projects and weapons development..removeOne scene showed Mr Kim – noticeably slimmer than in previous months – walking gingerly at a rainy construction site as a narrator said he showed his “motherly side by entirely devoting his body into realising people’s dreams”.South Korean intelligence officials told legislators in October that Mr Kim has lost about lbs in weight, but that he remains healthy and is trying to boost public loyalty to him as he navigates the toughest period of his rule due to economic hardships worsened by the pandemic.The North’s accelerated weapons tests, which came amid efforts to strengthen internal unity and tighten the government’s grip over the economy, possibly reflect a sense of urgency within Pyongyang’s leadership for outside relief, analysts say.While tentatively reopening freight train traffic with China last month, Mr Kim is also reviving his brinkmanship tactics to wrest concessions from the Biden administration, which has offered open-ended talks but shown no willingness to ease sanctions unless Mr Kim takes real steps to abandon his nuclear weapons programme.Sunday’s flight test of the Hwasong- intermediate-range ballistic missile marked the longest-distance weapon the North has tested since , when it twice flew Hwasong-s over Japan and, separately, three intercontinental ballistic missiles that demonstrated the potential to reach deep into the American homeland.The launch came days after Mr Kim called a ruling party meeting where officials issued a veiled threat to end the North’s  moratorium on the testing of nuclear devices and longer-range missiles, citing US hostility.US secretary of state Antony Blinken spoke with Japanese foreign minister Hayashi Yoshimasa by phone and condemned North Korea’s recent ballistic tests, which were in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, and vowed trilateral cooperation with South Korea to deal with the North Korean threat, a spokesman said.Experts say the North could halt its testing spree after the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics this week out of respect for China, its major ally and economic leline.But there are also expectations it could signicantly up the ante in weapons demonstrations once the Olympics end later this month to grab the attention of the Biden administration, which has been focusing more on confronting China and Russia over its conflict with Ukraine..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: North Korean leader Kim attends concert glorying his

dispel “myths” around EVs and promote new incentives for adopting the vehicles.More than , people have signed an online petition by FairCharge urging Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Transport Secretary

many issues with public chargers such as cost, availability, reliability, speed of charging and ease of payment, which have the potential to either accelerate or slow down EV adoption depending on how

While GCSEs could remain part of the system, it argues that “arbitrary” assessment at age  should be scrapped.The report says that the IAC undertook its review “in the context of major, unanticipated changes in the approach taken to the assessment and grading of qualications” during the pandemic, when full public exams were cancelled for two years in a row in  and .It says that the review followed the “sudden, dramatic and contentious changes” to exams that became necessary as a response to the pandemic, and that this revealed how the system in England “was not sufficiently robust to cope with a crisis such as that related to Covid”.It adds that it is “important to dferentiate between the experiences in schools and colleges of changes to qualications over the past two years” and plans for long-term changes to the future of exams, as the teacher assessment brought in in  and  “were changes that were responses to a pandemic”.Professor Louise Hayward, chair of the IAC, said that it was “beyond doubt” that the current exams system was “failing its own test” to provide an assessment system that served pupils, society and the economy “sufficiently”.“The IAC report identies inequalities deeply ingrained in a system and which has to changethere is to be greater educational equality,” she added.“We need a system that helps every young person to progress to college, employment or university with qualications that recognise their achievements and the capabilities they need to succeed in the challenging times that lie ahead..remove“Currently, too many young people feel that they are denied opportunities because their time at school has not been properly recognised – this is not good for them, nor is it good for their future employers, our economy and society.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that there was a “gathering body of opinion that our exams system needs an overhaul”.vw,vw,px, px\"Geoff Barton said there was a ‘gathering body of opinion’ in favour of overhauling exams He added: “Many people in education feel that our current system of GCSEs is an anachronism which harks back to an era when large numbers of young people left school at  rather than generally going on to further education and training as they do now.”Mr Barton said that the Government had “doubled down on this anachronism” through “making the current iteration of GCSEs rather like old-fashioned O-levels”.The reformed GCSEs introduced by former Education Secretary Michael Gove from  onwards were intended to be more academically rigorous.Mr Barton said GCSEs in their current form were “very academic, with lots of memorisation, and assessed almost solely on a large set of terminal exams”.He added: “There is also a strong argument for making more use of digital technology in assessment, which could not only move us away from the pen and paper era but allow for more adaptive assessment built around the inidual student.”Exam board AQA announced plans for a pilot of online exams earlier this month, with up to , pupils participating. The pilot will include GCSE maths, English and science online and will also involve “adaptive – or ‘smart’ – assessments that adjust in dficulty as students progress through the test”.Mr Barton added: “But we do need to be conscious also about the importance of ensuring that any adaptations to the current exam system are do-able and deliverable, and beware of entirely trying to re-invent the wheel.“This in itself contains enormous challenges and risks. It is probably a case of evolution rather than revolution.”AQA chief executive Colin Hughes said that digital assessment was “only a matter of time” and that as AQA was the largest exam board, it was “determined to play a key role in making it a success”.“Digital reform is about evolution, not revolution, and doesn’t have to spell the end of GCSEs: as a qualication, they’ve proved extremely adaptable over time,” he added.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Exams are the best and fairest form of assessing what students know and can do, and ensure young people leave school or college prepared for the workplace and higher study.“Our reformed GCSEs rigorously assess the knowledge acquired by pupils and are in line with expected standards in countries with high-performing education systems.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: End  uarbitrary u exams at age , says review"},{"url":null,"title":"corrie-star-sally-dynevor-among-receive-honours-windsor-castle","story":"Coronation Street star Sally Dynevor will be among recipients of prestigious honours from the Princess Royal at Windsor Castle.The actress has played ambitious Sally Webster in the soap since , having made her television debut a year earlier in an episode of police drama Juliet Bravo.She shared her “shock” after being made an MBE in the Queen’s  New Year Honours list in recognition of her services to drama.Dynevor will officially receive her insignia from Anne in an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle on Wednesday.Other investees set to attend the event include Sir Antonio Horta-Osorio, who resigned as chairman of global banking giant Credit Suisse in January following an internal investigation into allegations of breaching coronavirus rules.The executive, who is also a former boss of Lloyds Banking Group, was knighted in June  for his services to the financial sector, as well as his voluntary work for mental healthcare and culture.He had headed up Santander’s UK arm before taking over at Lloyds in early  when the bank was on its knees after its £. billion taxpayer bailout at the height of the financial crisis following an ill-fated rescue of rival HBOS.The Portuguese banker, who left Lloyds in April last year to join Credit Suisse had won widespread praise for his stewardship of Lloyds from near collapse back to rude health.He quit Credit Suisse in January after it emerged he had allegedly breached Covid rules last year, including by reportedly attending the Wimbledon tennis finals despite having recently arrived from Switzerland, which was on the UK’s amber travel list at the time.Teachers, emergency service workers and military officers will also be recognised in the ceremony, with several honoured specically for their response to Covid-.A total of  recipients have been invited to be given their honours in person..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Corrie star Sally Dynevor among those to receive honours at Windsor Castle"},{"url":null,"title":"queen-passes-harrys-rugby-patronages-kate","story":"The Duchess of Cambridge has taken over the Duke of Sussex’s former roles as patron of the Rugby Football Unionand the Rugby Football League .Kate was given the royal patronages by the Queen and Kensington Palace said the high-profile sporting appointments “closely align with Her Royal Highness’ long-standing passion for sport and the lelong benefits it can provide”.It makes the duchess the first member of the royal family to officially receive one of the Sussexes’ past patronages and the confirmation comes ahead of the start of the Guinness Six Nations tournament this weekend.In a new video released by Kensington Palace to mark her new patronages, Kate can be seen passing a rugby ball to players.The duchess said she was “thrilled” to take on the roles in a personal message accompanying the clip on social media.The video shows her in workout gear and throwing a rugby ball off-screen.In the next frame, the ball lands in the hands of Thea Northcott, a rugby union community game player, who passes it on to Harry Newman from the England rugby league men’s team.The caption on Twitter reads: “I am so thrilled to become patron of the @TheRFL and @EnglandRugby.“Two fantastic organisations who are committed to harnessing the power that sport can have in bringing communities together and helping iniduals flourish.”“I look forward to working with them across all levels of the games, and to cheering England on in what promises to be an exciting year for both sports!

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost!

Pugh’s monumental history of Dunbar is consulted, we read that there was a turnpike toll at Kirkhill near the town’s parish church another on the main road through Belhaven and a third known as Cleikimin Toll on the road from Dunbar to Spott.Kirkhill Toll stood near the parish church, near the former site of the Bellevue Hotel there is a house at the site today but this rather large two-story building does not look like a toll-house.Cleikimin Toll stood until Edwardian times but is today buried underneath the A road.Mr Pugh assures us that Belhaven Toll was known within living memory to bus drivers and conductors, but its situation has been open to debate.The Canmore database of Historic Environment Scotland contains the following reference to it: “Benston Cottage, in the angle between the Aand the south going cross road, is reported locally to have been a toll house, but it shows no features distinguishing as such apart, perhaps, from an outshot  foot square abutting its E end, with a small window facing the road. Visited  February .”Now who is right  The Belhaven locals or the Edinburgh architectural historian The earliest newspaper mention of Belhaven Toll is from July , when a certain James M’Dougal was on trial in Edinburgh for issuing counterfeit £ banknotes.The prisoner had asked several toll-keepers to issue change for his bogus banknotes, but when he came to Belhaven Toll and asked for a glass of whisky, the tollkeeper James Liddle did not at all like the look of the £ note he was handed.After the scoundrel M’Dougal had beaten a hasty retreat, Liddle gave the banknote to a Dunbar bank agent who pronounced it to be a forgery.M’Dougal was found guilty and sentenced to death issuing  banknotes was considered a heinous offence in those days.The property page of The Scotsman of March ,  contains the following important notice: “LAND AND HOUSES NEAR DUNBAR.It says: “The park adjoining the post-road on the west side of Belhaven Toll, consisting of  acres English measure or thereby, as presently possessed by Mr France, together with the dwelling-house, large garden, and offices thereon, called Rosebank.”It turns out that Rosebank House is still standing today, although a number of houses have been built in its extensive grounds, some of them along Edinburgh Road itself, including the former Belhaven police station.The next mention of Belhaven Toll is in the Edinburgh Evening Courant of October , , announcing the sale of “That PIECE of ENCLOSED GROUND, extending to   Acres imperial measure of thereby, situated to the South of Belhaven Toll-Bar, on the West Side of the road leading from Belhaven to Spott, and contiguous to the Line of the North British Railway Company”.These newspaper notices establish, without any doubt, that there was a toll-bar at Belhaven, constructed before  and still operational in  when the arrival of the railways meant that the old tollgates were under threat.William Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire tells us that the toll was there already by that time, at the junction of the post-road and a road going to the south-east.The newspapers provide some further valuable clues to its position.Back in , the grounds of Rosebank were on the south side of the post-road [today Edinburgh Road], just west of the junction with the road from Belhaven to Spott [today Beveridge Row].In , the farmland between Belhaven and the mainline railway was bordering what is today the west side of Beveridge Row and stated to be situated to the south of Belhaven Toll.This would indicate that the toll-house was situated at the corner of Edinburgh Road and Beveridge Row, and indeed this is the exact position of ‘Benston Cottage’ described in the Canmore survey by the doubting Edinburgh historian. I would not agree with the opinion of this inidual that the building looks unlike a toll-house.The Edinburgh toll-houses, of which specimens survive at Morningside and Merchiston, are single-storey buildings but have some quaint architectural features. The East Lothian toll-houses were even more primitive, even by the standards of the time: small and low cottages offering only the most basic amenities.Belhaven Toll – alias Benston Cottage – very much, in fact, resembles the Goatfield toll-house at what is today  Dunbar Road, Haddington, and the surviving toll-house in Haddington, Abbey and Aberlady.Thus it can be concluded that the locals were right, and that Belhaven Toll still stands today!On the morning of September , , the No.  bus between Dunbar and North Berwick took off without any incident.But on Edinburgh Road, Belhaven, it was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Antara and veered off the road, crashing right into. . . Benston Cottage alias Belhaven Toll!Fortunately, the cottage was empty as it was undergoing renovation further remedial work would surely be needed since the bus hit it with considerable force, knocking down the front door and some of the wall.A number of police and firefighters were soon at the scene, successfully cutting the trapped bus driver free using hydraulic gear and making sure that the other victims of the crash were taken away in ambulances. A -year-old East Linton RAF veteran, who had been a passenger on the bus, hit a handrail hard and later died in hospital.A -year-old man, the driver of the Antara, was charged with causing the incident, being handed by the courts an order of  hours of community service and banned from driving for three years.As for the battered former toll-house, it was repaired and taken care of by a firm of property developers, and is today used as a holiday let for out-of-town sportsmen and visitors, ‘sleeping six’ in the restored cottage and offering extra storage for surf boards and golf clubs.It is curious that neither the newspaper accounts of the bus crash, nor the Benston Cottage homepage ‘fishing’ for customers, mention the interesting past of the former toll-house.History can be made, but it can equally easily be forgotten."},{"url":null,"title":"families-invited-enjoy-six-week-library-programme","story":"Starting next month at Prestonpans Library but open to all, a group to support parents and carers develop a love of reading together will gather weekly in small informal groups for East Lothian Council’s ‘The Big Read’.The Big Read is a six-week programme to help parents and children develop a family reading habit.Parents carers will meet as a group to choose books and discover ways to engage their children – on alternate weeks, children will join for stories and crafts.Each child that takes part will receive three free books and a certicate.For more information or to register, families should email cmesser@eastlothian.gov.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"snooker-legends-coming-musselburgh","story":"The two will recreate some of their most famous duels, accompanied by icon John Virgo as referee and host delivering his famous snooker impressions.The night will conclude with a Q and A session with a chance to ask your favourite stars the burning questions you’ve always wanted to ask.: Craig Hills Pumped! comes to MusselburghVIP tickets are also available which will allow locals to get up close and personal with their favourite stars of the sport as well as premium seating and a complimentary drink.The show will take place on Wednesday, March  at .pm, with the VIP meet and greet taking place at pm.Tickets are £and can be purchased via telephone    or online at www.thebrunton  "},{"url":null,"title":"pupils-help-boosts-local-charity","story":"Rebecca Fenwick, Molly Jones and Rachel Young were declared the winners of the school’s Youth Philanthropy Initiative .The event, which took place in the Tranent secondary school’s library, saw seven good causes represented by youngsters, with a prize of £, to the winners.The money will now go to Growing Matters at Gilmerton House Kitchen Garden, which is based at Gilmerton House, near Athelstaneford.The small charity, run by volunteers, provides opportunities for social and therapeutic gardening within a four-acre walled garden.Restoration and re-purposing of the garden is gradually taking place for the benefit of the local community, with bioersity in mind.Health and wellbeing of all who use the garden is a priority, including the many species which share the space with the volunteers and which pollinate food crops.Lindsay Munro, English teacher at Ross High School, was delighted to see the trio win the four-figure sum after an impressive presentation.She told the Courier she was “absolutely chuffed” for the group and said: “It was just quite a slick presentation overall.“Obviously, they worked really hard to build up a relationship with the charity.“They had gone and visited it and made a montage of pictures that they had taken while they were visiting.“They had made that connection.“They made an effort to go and visit and they were really confident and passionate about what they were doing, the kind of things Growing Matters do and the impact within the community.”Each group of pupils was challenged to research and represent a local grassroots charity.Pupils then had to try to come up with their own creative presentations in a bid to secure the funding.Diana Simcock, from Growing Matters at Gilmerton House Kitchen Garden, thanked the youngsters for their efforts.She said: “We are absolutely delighted and so impressed with what they have done really impressed.“These are young girls who just identied us and we said ‘why are you interested in us ’ and they just liked the idea of what we do.”The charity already has planning permission in place to build a craft workshop.It is estimated the workshop will cost about £,, with the money from the YPI event going towards that cost.Diana added: “Everything we do is as local and sustainable as possible.

Ordnance Survey [OS    ] lists the house as “A toll gate at which road dues are collected between Linton and Dunbar.“It is the property of the County road trustees, and is at present occupied by Gilbert Miller.”Thus it can be concluded that East Linton did, indeed, have a turnpike toll-house, probably dating back at least to the mid-th century when the tollbars were set up and the houses constructed along the main turnpike road.Like the other tolls mentioned here, it was a casualty to the railways being constructed, reducing road traffic very considerably and starving the toll-keepers out of existence in late Victorian times.But where is the old toll-house today There is no building on the main road past East Linton in any way resembling a toll-house, and the crossroads where it once stood has long since disappeared after a scheme to construct a bypass outside the village.Computerised super-imposition of a present-day map of East Linton onto Forrest’s  map indicates that the toll-house would be situated close to what is today Lauder Place.And, indeed, a stroll through those parts reveals the existence of the ‘Old Toll House’, accessed through a driveway from Lauder Place.A humble, single-story building just like the other East Lothian toll-houses, it has been signicantly extended at the back.By the present owner, it was identied as the former toll-house by the original deeds, which have since been mislaid.It would today have had a most tranquil situation, far from any of the major roads, had not the mainline railway been just a few feet away, with the trains roaring by with a deafening noise.When its present owner bought the old toll-house  years ago, it was in decent repair, albeit very small and cramped.Curiously, there was then a three foot square stone built room with a small window with iron bars, a prison cell perhaps, intended for people who refused to pay the toll But since the toll-keepers had no powers to imprison people, perhaps it was rather a whisky store, since the toll-keepers often doubled as low-level publicans It is also possible that the magistrates required a convenient holding-cell for local offenders before taking them to a burgh tolbooth.Since the ‘cell’ has long since been removed and the toll-house extensively renovated, with no original features remaining, we will never know.The East Lothian authorities built their toll-houses sturdy and strong, and the Old Toll House in East Linton is likely to stand for centuries to come.Jan Bondeson"},{"url":null,"title":"storm-malik-power-restored-county-clear-up-effort-underway","story":"Households in parts of Dunbar, East Linton, Innerwick and Garvald who were left without power following the storm this weekend have had their supplies restored.SP Energy Networks, which own and operates the electricity transmission and distribution network in south east Scotland, said that power was restored as quickly as possible following the storm.A statement on its Twitter said: \"We’d like to apologise to any of our customers who lost power during the storm and thank you for your patience as we work as quickly, and safely, as we can to clear any debris and reconnect services.\"Extreme weather conditions like gale force winds can make it extremely challenging for our engineering teams to fix issues with the network, especiallyclimbing poles or pylons is required.

https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm pic vIoAobCFSSThe First Minister said her advisory sub-group on education met and considered the issue last week.She told MSPs: “It concluded that although we may be close to the time when face coverings no longer need to be worn in the classroom assuming current trends continue, we have not yet reached that stage.“No-one wants young people to have to wear face coverings in the classroom for a moment longer than necessary.“But given the current uncertainty about infection trends in the immediate future, and the relatively high levels of Covid in the younger age groups, continued caution is prudent at this stage.”The new sub-iant - BA. - has been identied and is currently being investigated.The First Minister has said that BA. is \"not a cause for any alarm\" and there is no need to make any change to the current measures at the moment.There has been a total of  cases of the BA. sub-iant of Omicron have been confirmed in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said, though this number is likely to be an underestimate.The First Minister told MSPs: “Genomic sequencing is being used to investigate this further.“So far, I can confirm that in Scotland,  cases of BA. have been confirmed through genomic sequencing but we expect this number to increase as more sequencing results are reported.“And given that not all tests are genomically sequenced, it will be an underestimate of the presence of this sub-iant here.”She said there was no evidence that BA. led to more serious illness or had a greater chance of escaping immunity, however it appeared to be able to “out-run” Omicron.Flu vaccinations have now resumed for vulnerable groups. You should visit the NHS inform website to arrange to get your flu jab. Ms Sturgeon urged those who are eligible for their booster jab to get their vaccine. From February , vaccinated travellers, who are fully vaccinated or under , will no longer need to take a pre-departure Covid test and they will no longer be required to self-isolate on arrival until theyve received a negative result.Travellers in this group will still need to take a test on or before day  after arriving in the UK - which can be a lateral flow device rather than a PCR test from Sunday.Anyone who tests positive on their lateral flow test will need to isolate and take a free confirmatory PCR test.The new measures apply across the UK after an agreement between the UK Government and the three devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.Ms Sturgeon warned last week that travel restrictions could be reintroduced in light of a new iant so this is constantly being monitored. See the full guidance via the Scottish Government website.Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people

address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"new-highway-code-2022-test-new-rules-starting-today","story":"Major changes to the Highway Code requiring drivers to have more responsibility to look out for cyclists and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media -

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances.

Children from P , P  and P  are instead accessing learning from home. Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While GCSEs could remain part of the system, it argues that “arbitrary” assessment at age  should be scrapped.The report says that the IAC undertook its review “in the context of major, unanticipated changes in the approach taken to the assessment and grading of qualications” during the pandemic, when full public exams were cancelled for two years in a row in  and .It says that the review followed the “sudden, dramatic and contentious changes” to exams that became necessary as a response to the pandemic, and that this revealed how the system in England “was not sufficiently robust to cope with a crisis such as that related to Covid”.It adds that it is “important to dferentiate between the experiences in schools and colleges of changes to qualications over the past two years” and plans for long-term changes to the future of exams, as the teacher assessment brought in in  and  “were changes that were responses to a pandemic”.Professor Louise Hayward, chair of the IAC, said that it was “beyond doubt” that the current exams system was “failing its own test” to provide an assessment system that served pupils, society and the economy “sufficiently”.“The IAC report identies inequalities deeply ingrained in a system and which has to changethere is to be greater educational equality,” she added.“We need a system that helps every young person to progress to college, employment or university with qualications that recognise their achievements and the capabilities they need to succeed in the challenging times that lie ahead.“Currently, too many young people feel that they are denied opportunities because their time at school has not been properly recognised – this is not good for them, nor is it good for their future employers, our economy and society.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that there was a “gathering body of opinion that our exams system needs an overhaul”. vw,vw,px, px\"Geoff Barton said there was a ‘gathering body of opinion’ in favour of overhauling exams He added: “Many people in education feel that our current system of GCSEs is an anachronism which harks back to an era when large numbers of young people left school at  rather than generally going on to further education and training as they do now.”Mr Barton said that the Government had “doubled down on this anachronism” through “making the current iteration of GCSEs rather like old-fashioned O-levels”.The reformed GCSEs introduced by former Education Secretary Michael Gove from  onwards were intended to be more academically rigorous.Mr Barton said GCSEs in their current form were “very academic, with lots of memorisation, and assessed almost solely on a large set of terminal exams”.He added: “There is also a strong argument for making more use of digital technology in assessment, which could not only move us away from the pen and paper era but allow for more adaptive assessment built around the inidual student.”Exam board AQA announced plans for a pilot of online exams earlier this month, with up to , pupils participating. The pilot will include GCSE maths, English and science online and will also involve “adaptive – or ‘smart’ – assessments that adjust in dficulty as students progress through the test”.Mr Barton added: “But we do need to be conscious also about the importance of ensuring that any adaptations to the current exam system are do-able and deliverable, and beware of entirely trying to re-invent the wheel.“This in itself contains enormous challenges and risks. It is probably a case of evolution rather than revolution.”AQA chief executive Colin Hughes said that digital assessment was “only a matter of time” and that as AQA was the largest exam board, it was “determined to play a key role in making it a success”.“Digital reform is about evolution, not revolution, and doesn’t have to spell the end of GCSEs: as a qualication, they’ve proved extremely adaptable over time,” he added.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Exams are the best and fairest form of assessing what students know and can do, and ensure young people leave school or college prepared for the workplace and higher study.“Our reformed GCSEs rigorously assess the knowledge acquired by pupils and are in line with expected standards in countries with high-performing education systems.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.

I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band.

Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings.

Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear.

Given that he has been stripped of his titles and patronages, we think it [not flying the flag] is the right course of action to take, especially when we still have questions and victims who are still grieving when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein and the dangerous legacy he has left behind.”Seconding the proposal, DUP group leader Brian Kingston said his party previously opposed the motion in order to protect the number of designated flag days.He added: “We will continue to oppose the reduction of those days by parties who don’t want the Union flag flown at all.

Indeed, the intensity of those allegations has only increased since they first emerged in .”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Kingston said the Battle of the Somme was “seared into the consciousness of Ulstermen”, so he felt it was a more appropriate date to fly the Union flag.Independent councillor John Kyle said: “Under the circumstances, I think this is a wise move. We are following the lead of the Queen, who has removed Andrew from his royal duties and stripped his royal titles.“In the circumstances of these serious allegations, it would not be appropriate to fly the flag on his birthday.”SDLP councillor Donal Lyons, who tabled the original motion that the flag not be flown, said his point was not about “national identity” but the allegations against the prince and “the message we send to women and girls in our city”.“If we had proceed to honour a man in this context, I think it would have been an extremely retrograde step,” he added.“I would also say we always supported not losing any of the designated flag-flying days. I’m glad we’ve come to the position we are at at the moment.”People Before Profit’s Fiona Ferguson said she supported not flying the flag to mark Andrew’s birthday but disagreed with using an “imperialist symbol” to mark the Battle of the Somme.Ms McAllister’s proposals were passed without a vote.Following the confirmation that the civil case against Andrew would proceed, the Queen stripped him of his patronages, which meant he lost his honorary titles at Royal Portrush, Royal Belfast and Royal County Down golf clubs.It was also confirmed his military titles had been ed to the Queen and that he would stop using the title ‘His Royal Highness’ in an official capacity.Prince Andrew visited Royal Portrush when it hosted The Open in , ing to the course to play a round later that year. He opened its new clubhouse in  and was a long-standing patron of the club.Under Belfast City Council rules, the Union flag is flown at City Hall on a number of designated days — Prince Andrew’s birthday being one of them — each year.These days are set out by Westminster Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.The vote at Belfast City Council comes amid the fallout from the civil assault case against the duke filed by Virginia Giuffre.A judge in the US ruled last month that the matter should proceed.Ms Giuffre claims that she was trafficked by the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was  years old — a minor under US law.He has repeatedly denied the allegations.Most ReadCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewEnd of an era as Burger King set to move from its Belfast city centre locationIrish League grounds will be closedcrowd trouble continues: IFA warning is ‘not an idle threat’DUP’s South Down chairman still backing Edwin Poots, saying Diane Forsythe selection ‘fight to make party more liberal’Teenagerwho raped his girlfriendavoids prison sentenceTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: End of an era as Burger King set to move from Belfast city centre locationPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere Latest Northern IrelandNew Presbyterian Church head ‘willing to see woman church moderator’ in futureDUP councillor hits out at Alliance Party for revealing ‘confidential information’ about remote meetingsNI’s outdated planning system strangling entire economy, warns DUP’s BuckleyOriginal copy of James Joyce’s Ulysses back on display in Belfast after restoration by expert Sean MaddenNI child could suffer horric death similar to Arthur Labinjo-Hughes ‘due to lack of social workers’LatestSantander profits soar but fraud remains a problemNew Presbyterian Church head ‘willing to see woman church moderator’ in futureLandslides kill at least  as heavy rain hits Ecuadorian capitalPunxsutawney Phil prepares to make Groundhog Day predictionBudget airlines carry fewer passengers in January,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

attends concert glorifying his power","story":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un By Kim Tong-Hyung, APFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his we have attended a Lunar New Year’s Day concert in Pyongyang where he received cheers from audience members and artists who praised him for heralding a “new era” of national power, state media reported.The North’s official media has been highlighting Kim’s authoritarian leadership following a spree of missile tests in January, which some experts see as an attempt to pressure Washington over deadlocked nuclear negotiations after two years of pandemic border closures and economic decay.The Biden administration has called for the UN Security Council to meet on Thursday to discuss North Korea’s most recent test of an intermediate-range missile potentially capable of reaching Guam, a key US military hub in the Pacic.Sunday’s test signalled a resumption of major weapons testing that Mr Kim had suspended in  while initiating diplomacy with then-US president Donald Trump.Talks between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since the collapse of the second Kim-Trump meeting in , when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demands for a major release of crippling US-led sanctions in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The Korean Central News Agency said Mr Kim and his we, Ri Sol Ju, were greeted with “stormy cheers” after arriving at Pyongyang’s massive Mansudae Art Theatre for Tuesday’s concert.KCNA said the audience appreciated that Mr Kim was “ushering in on this land a new world and a new era when the people’s ideals and happiness and desire for building a powerful country are comprehensively translated into reality”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Artists performed songs and dances that demonstrated the “single-minded unity” of North Korean people and their devotion to build a socialist country “to be envied by the world”, the report said.North Korean TV showed Mr Kim galloping through a forest on a white horse – a symbol associated with his family’s dynastic rule over the country – in a new documentary praising his alleged accomplishments in , including anti-virus campaigns, construction projects and weapons development.One scene showed Mr Kim – noticeably slimmer than in previous months – walking gingerly at a rainy construction site as a narrator said he showed his “motherly side by entirely devoting his body into realising people’s dreams”.South Korean intelligence officials told legislators in October that Mr Kim has lost about lbs in weight, but that he remains healthy and is trying to boost public loyalty to him as he navigates the toughest period of his rule due to economic hardships worsened by the pandemic.The North’s accelerated weapons tests, which came amid efforts to strengthen internal unity and tighten the government’s grip over the economy, possibly reflect a sense of urgency within Pyongyang’s leadership for outside relief, analysts say.While tentatively reopening freight train traffic with China last month, Mr Kim is also reviving his brinkmanship tactics to wrest concessions from the Biden administration, which has offered open-ended talks but shown no willingness to ease sanctions unless Mr Kim takes real steps to abandon his nuclear weapons programme.Sunday’s flight test of the Hwasong- intermediate-range ballistic missile marked the longest-distance weapon the North has tested since , when it twice flew Hwasong-s over Japan and, separately, three intercontinental ballistic missiles that demonstrated the potential to reach deep into the American homeland.The launch came days after Mr Kim called a ruling party meeting where officials issued a veiled threat to end the North’s  moratorium on the testing of nuclear devices and longer-range missiles, citing US hostility.US secretary of state Antony Blinken spoke with Japanese foreign minister Hayashi Yoshimasa by phone and condemned North Korea’s recent ballistic tests, which were in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, and vowed trilateral cooperation with South Korea to deal with the North Korean threat, a spokesman said.Experts say the North could halt its testing spree after the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics this week out of respect for China, its major ally and economic leline.But there are also expectations it could signicantly up the ante in weapons demonstrations once the Olympics end later this month to grab the attention of the Biden administration, which has been focusing more on confronting China and Russia over its conflict with Ukraine.Most ReadCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times.

This device is located in a mph zone.A closer examination of the latest PCSP figures reveal that the mph speed in Ardglass was recorded on November  at am.In addition,  drivers were clocked at travelling over mph in the mph zone at the entrance to the village, with almost  percent of drivers detected travelling at between mph and mph. Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph. The highest number of offences was recorded at pm.The highest speed recorded at the Newcastlersquos South Promenade was mph, with two drivers recorded travelling at over mph. The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening. The message that speed kills cannot be reinforced enough,he remarked.ldquoThere is clearly a hardcore of drivers who care little for their own safety, or that of other road users. It is an issue that must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Ashling.jpg","title":"Twilight vigil for Ashling  ","story":"MEMBERS of Newcastle CCEacute and the wider community came together last week for a twilight vigil in memory of Ashling Murphy, the -year-old teacher from Tullamore, Co Offaly, who was murdered while out running.Musicians gathered at the Garden of Hope at the Lodge in Castlewellan on Tuesday night to pay their respects to the talented traditional musician with music and poetry.Ashling was an active member of the Ballyboy Comhaltas branch in Co Offaly.Many local branch members have spent time in Tullamore attending All Ireland Fleadhs and some have walked along the Grand Canal where Ashling was killed.Some of the Comhaltasrsquo younger musicians were friends with Ashling and played music with her. They enjoyed each otherrsquos company and are still coming to terms with the tragedy.Cllr Roisin Howell, who organised the event, told the assembled people: ldquoAll of us in the branch are shocked and saddened by the death of Ashling Murphy.ldquoThe brutal manner of her death has both angered and bewildered the entire nation. We stand here in the Garden of Hope, united this evening, keeping Ashlingrsquos family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.A poem by Belfast writer Helen McClements was read out and the musicians honoured Ashlingrsquos memory by playing some of the tunes they had played with her.People also left candles and flowers at the monument as the music played.The first verse of the poem is as follows:Before she went down to the Grand CanalI wondershe chanced to run earlyCatching the last of the waning sunBefore darkness fellSnuffing out the light..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Brigid.jpg","title":"Two hour talk  to re engage with life of St Brigid and her link to district  ","story":"THE distinctive St Brigidrsquos cross is something that many Catholics are very familiar with, including having fond memories of being taught how to make one at school which was proudly displayed at home.As the the feast day, February , approaches, the interest in the le and work of one of the worldrsquos most beloved saints is still high.Local people will have the chance to re-engage with the story of St Brigid, who is special to the Downpatrick area as she is reputedly buried alongside St Patrick in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Historian and tour guide Brigid Watson, of Sustainable Journeys Ireland, will be hosting a talk on the le of St Brigid with a demonstration of cross-making and a chance for participants to make personal crosses.Entitled Brigid Saint or Goddess, the two-hour talk will be held at the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick from -pm next Tuesday, February , and again on February  and March .Brigid explains why the story of St Brigid and her namesake remains fascinating to her.ldquoSt Brigid is the female patroness of Ireland and one of the most widely revered saints in Ireland and beyond. She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13434480.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I took up art, I did it for about a year and that was the end of that.“Then about five years ago, my sister’s husband had died and we were clearing out the house. I found that she’d kept all of the sketches I’d done when I was  in an envelope. “I started looked at them, messing around with them, I bought some paints and started colouring them in.Clubsound in the s. PACEMAKER PRESS BELFAST“The nights I wasn’t working I was painting. In two years I must have done about  paintings for people.“It’s a blessing for me, it kept me sane, when you play every week and suddenly you stop, it hits you hard.“It relieved the boredom, it gave me something to focus on, when a painting turned out successful you felt you’d achieved something.“My biggest satisfaction is that I’ve painted memories for people that are now hanging in their house.George Jones started and finished his radio career with Downtown. Picture by CHARLES MCQUILLAN PACEMAKER.“It’s another sense of entertainment I suppose, another string to my bow. If my sister hadn’t kept those sketches I wouldn’t have all of this.”George recalled his sister’s influence on his musical career: “The first two records my sister brought in that started me on music when I was about nine or  were Little Richard ‘Long Tall Sally’ and Elvis ‘All Shook Up’. “In those days it wasn’t vinyl, it was  bakelite – it looked the same as vinyl butyou’d dropped it, it would have smashed. “I listened to them non-stop and then she bought me my first guitar at .”George said he formed skfle groups with boys of his age in the Bloomfield area of east Belfast. One of them was Van Morrison, whom George went on to tour with as The Monarchs.He said: “I go to lunch with Van Morrison quite a lot. The Monarchs were the first band to go to Germany. We had a hit record in  when the Beatles were still hovering around Germany.“Van has been trying to find the rights to it to repress it and put it out as a single on vinyl. I sung on it and he played saxophone – a bit of rock and roll.”George, who has been part of the successful ‘Do You Come Here Often ’ and ‘Rock ‘n Roll Years and Dance Hall Days’ shows, started learning the guitar at . He believes that might be the magic number: “I’ve interviewed so many people in my years on the radio who started the exact same way. “I’m hesitant to ask when they started to play the guitar – it’s always . So many great guitarists I interviewed, the likes of Hank B Marvin, started at .”Having found his first chords at  George is still going strong at .He said: “For me it’s been an incredible le, just when you think it’s all over, Clubsound have found a new lease of le.“We’ve found out that young people have started listening to the albums their parents have. I hesitate to use the term, but you become a cult.“Young ones come up to me and say ‘Yeoooo, Shankill Airways, my mum plays that all the time’.”George said the state modern music meant that people are yearning for songs from bygone days, especially the fties and sixties: “It was real music, there was no electronics – it was guitars, live drums, you were getting the whole live vibe.“In our day you just piled in, there was no such thing as tickets, you paid at the door and they squeezed in as many as they could.That added to the experience.”George plans to publish his memoirs as a book. In it he plans to recount his first meetings with Rory Gallagher and an incredibly green Gary Moore, of whom he told his father, ‘that wee lad will never be a guitar player’.‘It took a long time but I’m now over shock exit from Radio Ulster’George said that when he made his radio debut with Downtown his plan wasn’t to dilute his Clubsound persona too much.He said: “I used to bring what I did on stage onto the radio. I used to bring these we characters like Sadie that I did the voices for – she got more mail that I did. Radio needs to entertain,you’re on for two hours you’re not just sitting there spinning dics, you have to draw people in.”It wasn’t long before George was snapped up by Radio Ulster where he delivered ‘Just Jones’ for an amazing  years. Then one fateful day he was told he was surplus to requirements despite his popularity.George said: “People come up to me to this day, saying, ‘we miss you on the raido’ and ‘why did they do that to you’. “It was a big change in my le, it brought me down to earth more than anything. I thought those days were over – about two more times before that we were down and out and started over again, especially after the Miami thing and in South Africa my son nearly died of typhoid.“There were downs, but this was one I didn’t expect. I felt I was doing a good job.“During my six month notice period the public lted me to heights I never would believe. On the last week I was there I got nearly , emails from all over the world. I walked out of there about  feet tall. That was the bonus.”He said: “My we and family have helped me put it behind me. It took a long time because I was hurting.“I took up U with good success. It was water under the bridge and I had to put it under the bridge. I finished up in Downtown where I’d started in the s. Then I said to myself, radio is changing but it’s time for me to step aside.“When I look back now at radio in general, it’s like looking back to the wonder years of music, it saddens me – why has it changed so much  The commercial radio stations are just advertising boards with bits of music. “The word entertainment has disappeared from broadcasting. You couldn’t sit and listen to a radio show for two hours now, whereas before you’d have people would have been glad of that two hours of company.”Asked who he listens to on the ‘wireless’ George said: “Ken Bruce is still one of the old school and he makes me laugh. He still plays the oldies. Steve Wright still plays oldies. Asides from that it’s Classic FM.“It breaks my heart but I wouldn’t listen to any local radio stations.”Where to see George and Clubsound in actionClubsound’s current line-up of George Jones, David McKnight, Barry Woods, Alan McCartney and Jimmy Black will be on the road this spring including gigs at Theatre at The Mill in Newtownabbey on Saturday, March , Armagh’s Market Place Theatre on Saturday, April  and the Portico Arts and Heritage Centre in Portaferry on Monday, April .

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

While GCSEs could remain part of the system, it argues that “arbitrary” assessment at age  should be scrapped.The report says that the IAC undertook its review “in the context of major, unanticipated changes in the approach taken to the assessment and grading of qualications” during the pandemic, when full public exams were cancelled for two years in a row in  and .It says that the review followed the “sudden, dramatic and contentious changes” to exams that became necessary as a response to the pandemic, and that this revealed how the system in England “was not sufficiently robust to cope with a crisis such as that related to Covid”.It adds that it is “important to dferentiate between the experiences in schools and colleges of changes to qualications over the past two years” and plans for long-term changes to the future of exams, as the teacher assessment brought in in  and  “were changes that were responses to a pandemic”.Professor Louise Hayward, chair of the IAC, said that it was “beyond doubt” that the current exams system was “failing its own test” to provide an assessment system that served pupils, society and the economy “sufficiently”.“The IAC report identies inequalities deeply ingrained in a system and which has to changethere is to be greater educational equality,” she added.“We need a system that helps every young person to progress to college, employment or university with qualications that recognise their achievements and the capabilities they need to succeed in the challenging times that lie ahead..remove“Currently, too many young people feel that they are denied opportunities because their time at school has not been properly recognised – this is not good for them, nor is it good for their future employers, our economy and society.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that there was a “gathering body of opinion that our exams system needs an overhaul”. vw,vw,px, px\"Geoff Barton said there was a ‘gathering body of opinion’ in favour of overhauling exams He added: “Many people in education feel that our current system of GCSEs is an anachronism which harks back to an era when large numbers of young people left school at  rather than generally going on to further education and training as they do now.”Mr Barton said that the Government had “doubled down on this anachronism” through “making the current iteration of GCSEs rather like old-fashioned O-levels”.The reformed GCSEs introduced by former Education Secretary Michael Gove from  onwards were intended to be more academically rigorous.Mr Barton said GCSEs in their current form were “very academic, with lots of memorisation, and assessed almost solely on a large set of terminal exams”.He added: “There is also a strong argument for making more use of digital technology in assessment, which could not only move us away from the pen and paper era but allow for more adaptive assessment built around the inidual student.”Exam board AQA announced plans for a pilot of online exams earlier this month, with up to , pupils participating. The pilot will include GCSE maths, English and science online and will also involve “adaptive – or ‘smart’ – assessments that adjust in dficulty as students progress through the test”.Mr Barton added: “But we do need to be conscious also about the importance of ensuring that any adaptations to the current exam system are do-able and deliverable, and beware of entirely trying to re-invent the wheel.“This in itself contains enormous challenges and risks. It is probably a case of evolution rather than revolution.”AQA chief executive Colin Hughes said that digital assessment was “only a matter of time” and that as AQA was the largest exam board, it was “determined to play a key role in making it a success”.“Digital reform is about evolution, not revolution, and doesn’t have to spell the end of GCSEs: as a qualication, they’ve proved extremely adaptable over time,” he added.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Exams are the best and fairest form of assessing what students know and can do, and ensure young people leave school or college prepared for the workplace and higher study.“Our reformed GCSEs rigorously assess the knowledge acquired by pupils and are in line with expected standards in countries with high-performing education systems.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: End  uarbitrary u exams at age , says review article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “The Utility Regulator forewarned us that energy price rises of this nature will continue because of exceptionally high global wholesale gas prices, however it is never good news for consumers when prices go up. This is going to put extreme pressure on many households as they try to pay their gas bills. “With the cost of energy continuing to increase, the Consumer Council is concerned about a potential rise in fuel poverty as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “We welcome firmus energy’s commitment to assist some of our most vulnerable consumers through support for the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme, but it is clear that energy companies including firmus, policy makers, The Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high fuel prices will be with us for years.” Consumers who are struggling with their energy bills or topping up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.
