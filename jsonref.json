They’ve got these machines, you know water baths and drizzle things and cappuccino frothers and dehydrators and powder makers. They forget that what really matters with food is flavour and texture.‘Of course some of those things are great, and some of them taste wonderful but by and large a plate of food should not have more than four or five tastes max on it.‘If you put too many different tastes, your tastebuds can’t cope. You know you give children a palette of paints to paint with. If they mix them all together, guess what they get – a brown mud and it is the same with too many flavours, you get something that doesn’t taste of anything. I don’t like too much of that. I like the flavours to be crisp and separate and clean and fresh.’The much-loved restaurateur also said that despite her expertise, she sometimes has to rely on the help of others.‘I have to say that a whole lot of people came yesterday round my garden to have tea and cake and I just did not have time to make cake for 40 people,’ she said.‘So I went off to the Co-op and bought Mary Berry cake.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Culture of \u0026lsquodisbelieving survivors\u0026rsquo exists when dealing with asylum seekers, says ICCLTaoiseach and UK prime minister urge parties to take advantage of \u0026lsquonarrow window\u0026rsquoAircraft will take US president between Shannon and Doonbeg, weather permittingCyclist was struck while riding on the Gap of Dunloe Road on Sunday morningBishop Thomas Tobin\u0026rsquos comments deemed \u0026lsquodispiriting\u0026rsquo by Minister and criticised widelyToscan du Plantier family lawyer expects ruling to be appealed to Supreme CourtMother of girl (15) with butterfly skin disease focuses on the things her daughter can doBailey pleads for \u0026lsquopowers that be\u0026rsquo to intervene following French court\u0026rsquos murder verdictPSNI working with Garda to trace dissident republicans suspected of planting deviceMental health service has seen Europeans suffering panic attacks and suicidal thoughtsThere were 433 reported attacks in 2018, down from 493 in 2017 and 438 in 2016Young man died after being struck by lorry tractor unit early on Friday morningAfter conviction in France, English man calls on \u0026lsquosomebody... to admit they know it wasn\u0026rsquot me\u0026rsquoMan\u0026rsquos injuries not believed to be life-threatening, no arrests made as yet, say garda\u0026iacutePlacing of device at golf club condemned by senior PSNI figures and politiciansVictim in his 30s was struck by a Silver Ford Focus shortly before 10am on SaturdayScheme offers \u0026euro500 per patient to departments that switch from Humira and EnbrelUS president to arrive in Shannon Airport on Wednesday, June 5th, for a brief stayPSNI appeal for anyone who saw red Mazda in Oakfield Avenue area or Fairview RoadGarda\u0026iacute seek witnesses after driver of lorry hospitalised following crash with bus"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3912853.1559506235!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and may push for june deal to restore stormont","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May: urged Northern Ireland’s main political parties to engage “substantively” on forging a deal.  File photograph: Brian LawlessAFPGetty Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May have urged Northern Ireland’s five main parties to engage “substantively” on forging a deal to restore the Executive and Assembly.On Sunday night Mr Varadkar and Mrs May gave their approval for the British and Irish governments and the parties to press ahead with concerted efforts through this month to strike a deal to restore the powersharing institutions.“We believe it is imperative that the parties now move without delay to engaging substantively on the shape of a final agreement,” said Mr Varadkar and Mrs May in a joint statement issued on Sunday night.They said they believed there was a “genuine but narrow” opportunity for reaching agreement ahead of the beginning of the marching season in July.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Secretary Karen Bradley will now lead “intensified” talks at Stormont beginning on Monday aimed at reinstating the Executive and Assembly.All five parties said after round-table talks on Thursday that they were committed to reaching an agreement.In their statement, Mr Varadkar and Ms May noted how Mr Coveney and Ms Bradley recommended to them that the talks should continue with the aim of finding an agreement before the end of June.“We welcome the constructive engagement shown by all parties to date,” said the two leaders. “It is clear to us that the Northern Ireland political parties wish to see the institutions of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement restored, but operating on a more credible and sustainable basis.”Big hurdlesWithout referring to big hurdles such as an Irish-language act and same-sex marriage, they noted that key difficulties remained. “While broad consensus has been reached on some issues, other areas remain to be resolved,” they said.After a month of talks that were triggered by the fatal shooting of Lyra McKee by the New IRA in Derry, the two governments and the five parties agreed that the mood at the negotiations was positive but now was the time to try to grasp the challenging issues such as the Irish language and gay marriage.In advance of marching season, the difficulties over Brexit and the focus on the Conservatives choosing a new leader and prime minister, there is uncertainty over whether sufficient attention can be concentrated on achieving a deal.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said on Sunday night that “progress is possible and necessary”.“We have faced greater challenges in the past, and with generosity and imagination we have found a way forward,” she said. “Sinn Féin will enter the next phase of talks dedicated to reaching agreement and a route back to all-party powersharing.”Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeAllow young people to dip into pension pots to fund first home deposit, says Housing SecretaryD-Day veterans prepare to set sail for Normandy 75 years after invasion Men with prostate cancer offered hope by “search and destroy” treatmentComment: Sajid Javid can deliver Brexit -

Lawyers representing the woman asked the judge to partially lift the anonymity veil.Barrister William Tyzack and solicitor Alistair Myles, who is based at law firm Levison Meltzer Pigott, said the woman thought that disclosing Mr Terry\u0027s name publicly might encourage him to pay up.Judge Everall has given his approval but said neither the woman nor the girl can be named in reports. The judge said the woman is now caring for the baby in her mother\u0027s housing association flat, and living on state benefits totalling around £400 a month, and said there is evidence that Mr Terry has fathered 13 other children.He has approved the woman\u0027s claim for about £10,000 a month in maintenance, for her and the girl, and a lump sum payment of about £22,000 to cover rent payments and to buy furniture.Judge Everall said earlier this year he had ordered Mr Terry to pay interim maintenance, pending the completion of litigation.Companies House records show that Mr Terry has had an address in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, and involvement in a hair products firm called Her Imports.Mr Terry could not be reached for comment.Allow young people to dip into pension pots to fund first home deposit, says Housing SecretaryMen with prostate cancer offered hope by “search and destroy” treatmentD-Day veterans prepare to set sail for Normandy 75 years after invasion Why Tory leadership candidates are being urged to avoid live TV hustings \u0026#39like the plague\u0026#39Comment: Sajid Javid can deliver Brexit - and fuse \u0026#39white-van Conservatism\u0026#39 with metropolitan ToriesComment: Conservatives must address our country\u0026#39s shocking educational disparitiesWild swimmers revolt over British Triathlon efforts to prevent people swimming in cold waterBoris Johnson plans to spend at least £5,000 on every secondary school pupil in first domestic policy pledgeFrench must do more to stop Channel crossings, says immigration official Two five-year-old girls swept out to sea on blow-up swan after RNLI warning to parents over \u0026#34deadly\u0026#34 inflatablesIsil relatives among 800 Syrian women and children to be released from notorious refugee camp Comment: It’s never too \u2028late for Michael Caine to play an ageing criminalJeremy Hunt hints at Huawei climbdown as Donald Trump sets off for State visitThere is no point sending your children to Eton because education is in your genes, says geneticist\u0026#39Chinese Ecstasy\u0026#39 drug linked to 125 deaths has arrived in Britain, NCA warns festival goersStop gender-swapping Shakespeare characters because it tampers with the rhythm, former National Theatre director saysComment: The pollsters blatant dishonesty on Brexit is ruining the public trustMeet Ai-Da: the robot artist giving real painters a run for their moneyComment: Jacinda Ardern\u0026#39s trendy \u0026#34wellbeing\u0026#34 metrics are no way to assess an economyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/02/TELEMMGLPICT000199440388_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"d day veterans prepare set sail normandy 75 years invasion","story":"When Fred Brunt set sail 75 years ago it was as part of the largest seaborne invasion in historyWhen he set sail 75 years ago it was as part of the largest seaborne invasion in history an armada of 7,000 ships so vast bystanders observed one could practically walk across the English Channel.Tonight as the sun dips over the White Cliffs of Dover and MV Boudicca powered out across a glittering millpond sea, Fred Brunt found himself once more aboard a ship heading to the beaches of Northern France - for the very first time since D Day.“It’s hard to say why I’ve never been back,” says Brunt, who back on June 6, 1944 was a young able seaman and the coxswain of a landing craft transporting a tank on to Sword Beach during the first wave of Operation Overlord.“It will be an emotional journey. One thing I shall never forget is all the dead bodies. I’m looking forward to stepping out again on Sword Beach and will think of all those young men.”The 94-year-old Brunt is one of 255 Normandy veterans aboard the cruise ship MV Boudicca, which has been chartered by the Royal British Legion to sail between the D Day commemorative events over the week ahead. Addressing the nation during D Day King George VI described the mass sea and air assault to land more than 132,000 ground troops across five Normandy beachesas as “the great crusade”. Those reliving the journey this time prefer a simpler word: a pilgrimage, to honour those who never returned.The veterans arrived by coachload from across the country and as they prepared to board the Boudicca today were greeted by members of the Dover Sea Cadet band.Rear Admiral John Roberts, who during D Day was a sub-lieutenant aboard HMS Serapis and later became Captain of HMS Ark Royal, delivered a crisp salute before inspecting the teenage musicians who looked slightly terrified to be under the scrutiny of such a high ranking officer – albeit one now 95-years-old.Stressing the importance of remembering the events of the Second World War for future generations, he admitted this would in all likelihood be the last milestone anniversary which veterans would be able to attend in significant numbers. “I don’t think there will be enough of us around by the time it gets to the 80thanniversary,” he said. “This will be the final one.”Age may have diminished their numbers but it has not wearied them. Two female singers were serenading the new arrivals with wartime ditties and 97-year-old Joseph Weaver, a Yorkshireman who served in the Royal Artillery, dropped his bags and danced along to Vera Lynn’s White Cliffs of Dover. Prior to the evening departure Dame Vera, now 102, played a recorded message for those on board. “It will be nostalgic and sure to bring back lots of memories,” she said. “Rest assured we will never forget what you all did for us.” The Central Band of the Royal British Legion struck up on deck while Sir Rod Stewart, accompanied by his wife Penny Lancaster, also made a surprise appearance, serenading the veterans with Sailing before the ship departed. The couple were involved with the 70thanniversary of D Day and have remained in touch with some of the veterans, including Harold Bradley, who landed on Sword Beach on June 9, 1944, his 21st birthday.  Sir Rod described himself as “truly delighted to send our wonderful, brave soldiers off to the beaches of Normandy.” They came with their gleaming medals pinned proudly to their chests but, as ever, wearing their achievements lightly. Jim Docherty, 94, an able seaman aboard destroyer HMS Obedient during D Dayonly told his family five months ago he was involved in Operation Overlord and has never been back to France. “I wanted to come because there aren’t many of us left now I suppose, and that is a shame,” he said.On Monday the ship (which is being paid for out of fines from the Libor bank scandal) docks at Dunkirk – where in 1940 Allied troops were driven back by the Germans and planning for D Day begun in earnest.Joseph Weaver, 97 has a dance prior to boardingOn Wednesday MV Boudicca returns to Portsmouth for the national commemorative service attended by the Queen and US president Donald Trump. On Thursday the veterans will be back in France for the annual memorial service at Bayeux Cathedral in Normandy and adjoining war cemetery which contains 4,144 graves of Allied troops – among them Marine Leonard Waygood.His good friend and fellow Royal Marine, Joseph Kelsey, 96, is making the journey onboard Boudicca to honour his memory.Kelsey joined up at 18 alongside Leonard Waygood and both men took part in the first wave of the invasion. Waygood was killed on the first day and Kelsey survived by a whisker.His landing craft was shelled by the Germans on the way in – killing several men on board - and another neighbouring craft took a direct hit. “I want to come back to remember my friend,” he says. “It is always very emotional to go back to the beaches.”Fusilier Doug Farrington is another veteran onboard MV Boudicca who since the war has never been back to France. Now 93, he is among the youngest on board as he was sent to fight in Operation Overlord underage (the oldest to make the journey this week is 101-years-old). “I’m hoping it will be a bit quieter this time round,” he says.Fusilier Farrington arrived on Gold Beach 19 days after D Day and was on the frontline as the Allies drove German forces back through Europe. “It was fighting all the way,” he says. “People were being killed all the time and you lost a lot of your friends.”As well as remembering fallen colleagues he is looking forward to seeing the French civilians again – who 75 years ago clasped his hand in gratitude.“Back then they were very grateful we gave them back our freedom,” he says. “And I was only too happy to do it.”Allow young people to dip into pension pots to fund first home deposit, says Housing SecretaryMen with prostate cancer offered hope by “search and destroy” treatmentComment: Sajid Javid can deliver Brexit - and fuse \u0026#39white-van Conservatism\u0026#39 with metropolitan ToriesWhy Tory leadership candidates are being urged to avoid live TV hustings \u0026#39like the plague\u0026#39Comment: Conservatives must address our country\u0026#39s shocking educational disparitiesWild swimmers revolt over British Triathlon efforts to prevent people swimming in cold waterBoris Johnson plans to spend at least £5,000 on every secondary school pupil in first domestic policy pledgeFrench must do more to stop Channel crossings, says immigration official Two five-year-old girls swept out to sea on blow-up swan after RNLI warning to parents over \u0026#34deadly\u0026#34 inflatablesIsil relatives among 800 Syrian women and children to be released from notorious refugee camp Comment: It’s never too \u2028late for Michael Caine to play an ageing criminalJeremy Hunt hints at Huawei climbdown as Donald Trump sets off for State visitThere is no point sending your children to Eton because education is in your genes, says geneticist\u0026#39Chinese Ecstasy\u0026#39 drug linked to 125 deaths has arrived in Britain, NCA warns festival goersStop gender-swapping Shakespeare characters because it tampers with the rhythm, former National Theatre director saysComment: The pollsters blatant dishonesty on Brexit is ruining the public trustMeet Ai-Da: the robot artist giving real painters a run for their moneyBusinessman \u0026#39who fathered 14 children\u0026#39 must pay child support to British woman he met on Tinder, judge rulesComment: Jacinda Ardern\u0026#39s trendy \u0026#34wellbeing\u0026#34 metrics are no way to assess an economyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/02/TELEMMGLPICT000184553051_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"french must do stop channel crossings says immigration official","story":"Britain\u0026#39s Border Force carry an intercepted migrant dinghy off the Kent coastFrance has been urged to do more to stop illegal Channel crossings after scores of migrants were caught sailing to Britain last weekend.There have also been calls for air surveillance of the English Channel to stop people from entering the UK illegally this summer. Border Force officials detained 74 people, including small children, after eight boats were spotted off the Kent coast on Saturday.Two vessels were also intercepted in France by the French authorities, the Home Office said.  Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Service Union, said French authorities must take tougher action to prevent migrants from leaving their country.Migrant and refugee numbers are rising across EuropeShe told The Times: “These people should not be setting sail from France. They are buying boats and stealing boats. We really need a lot more work on the part of France.“These people are coming from France. They should apply for asylum in France and the French authorities should process that claim.”Criminal gangs are exploiting the migrant crisis by charging up to £20,000 to bring people from Iran and Afghanistan to the UK, Ms Moreton added.Damian Collins, Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, said he is extremely worried that current surveillance measures are not picking up small ships. “What happened this weekend demonstrates that the current scale of surveillance is not effective, he added. We need to look again at whether there should be air surveillance and also have a frank talk with the French about whether they are doing enough to stop people leaving their shores.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he has agreed a joint action plan with the French. We will continue to seek to return anyone who has entered the UK illegally, he said.The 74 people arrest on Saturday have since undergone medical examinations, and authorities are working to establish their nationalities.A criminal investigation has also been launched.Allow young people to dip into pension pots to fund first home deposit, says Housing SecretaryD-Day veterans prepare to set sail for Normandy 75 years after invasion Men with prostate cancer offered hope by “search and destroy” treatmentBoris Johnson plans to spend at least £5,000 on every secondary school pupil in first domestic policy pledgeComment: Sajid Javid can deliver Brexit - and fuse \u0026#39white-van Conservatism\u0026#39 with metropolitan ToriesWhy Tory leadership candidates are being urged to avoid live TV hustings \u0026#39like the plague\u0026#39Comment: Conservatives must address our country\u0026#39s shocking educational disparitiesWild swimmers revolt over British Triathlon efforts to prevent people swimming in cold waterTwo five-year-old girls swept out to sea on blow-up swan after RNLI warning to parents over \u0026#34deadly\u0026#34 inflatablesIsil relatives among 800 Syrian women and children to be released from notorious refugee camp Comment: It’s never too \u2028late for Michael Caine to play an ageing criminalJeremy Hunt hints at Huawei climbdown as Donald Trump sets off for State visitThere is no point sending your children to Eton because education is in your genes, says geneticist\u0026#39Chinese Ecstasy\u0026#39 drug linked to 125 deaths has arrived in Britain, NCA warns festival goersStop gender-swapping Shakespeare characters because it tampers with the rhythm, former National Theatre director saysComment: The pollsters blatant dishonesty on Brexit is ruining the public trustMeet Ai-Da: the robot artist giving real painters a run for their moneyBusinessman \u0026#39who fathered 14 children\u0026#39 must pay child support to British woman he met on Tinder, judge rulesComment: Jacinda Ardern\u0026#39s trendy \u0026#34wellbeing\u0026#34 metrics are no way to assess an economyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/16/TELEMMGLPICT000194091890_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqU2Nkv2NBUPc_0jJHvTFVmdsqMpDJkJI06L3nviO7tE4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"isil relatives among 800 syrian women children released notorious","story":"Women stand together at the al-Hol displacement camp in Hasaka governorateEight hundred Syrian women and children, including relatives of Isil jihadists, are to be released today on Monday from the Kurdish-run Al-Hol camp in northeast Syria despite concerns over security. The group will be handed over to their families following negotiations between the Syrian Democratic Forces, the mainly Kurdish US proxy group that runs the camp, and leaders of the Arab tribes to which the 800 people belong. A second mass release of camp residents is expected to follow in the days after the Islamic holiday of Eid, which takes place in the middle of this week.The releases were announced come despite widely held concerns that the camp has become a powder-keg for violent extremism, with some of its residents potentially still radicalised. The SDF, which has led the operation against Isil on the ground and been responsible for holding the men, women and children churned up in its wake, has maintained a practice of negotiating with local Arab tribes in order to engineer the controlled release of Syrians back into society.“The SDF early on decided on this approach, and it worked very well in Raqqa, for example, two and a half years ago. They find a member of the community, usually a Kurd, who acts as an interlocutor between the SDF and the Arab tribes,” said Dareen Khalifa,International Crisis Group’s senior Syria Analyst. Huge swathes of the Syrian population were swept up into Isis, many not on ideological grounds but for basic survival. In some cases, entire villages were negotiated into Isil by sheikhs or tribal leaders, who are now being pressed by their people to facilitate the return of women, children and some men.Those to be returned, Ms Khalifa said, will be pardoned by the SDF before being released from custody. Monday\u0027s group consists of residents of Raqqa and the town of Tabqa, 70 kilometres (43 miles) west. Those suspected of having links to IS will be kept under surveillance by local Arab tribes, who have given guarantees, said Abd al-Mehbach, co-chair of the Kurdish administration\u0027s executive council. Women line up for aid supplies at Al-Hol camp in Hassakeh province, Syria. It is the (Kurdish) administration\u0027s duty to its people to play a role in the rehabilitation of these women and children, and their reintegration into society, he said. Raqqa tribal leader Ali Mahamid Ali said Arab tribes were trying to secure the release of all Syrian women held in Al-Hol, including by offering guarantees. They are all our sisters, our mothers, he said. In deeply tribal eastern Syria, such a guarantee is an ironclad promise and could serve as a bulwark against the spread of Isil ideology by former members.But for the SDF, there is also a powerful financial driver to get Al-Hol’s population under control.  Each camp resident costs around $30 USD per day to feed and house, according to Crisis Group research, and that’s before security costs. Despite its military backing, the US has offered limited support for the battle’s aftermath, supporting the construction of just one prison. Despite the airtime given to foreign fighters, women and children, they number relatively few: fewer than 2,000 foreign men are thought to remain in SDF custody.But with other countries largely unwilling to take back their citizens, the issue of what to do with foreigners may prove the most protracted and expensive.The vast majority of those in Al-Hol and other SDF-run facilities are locals – Syrians and Iraqis. This makes community-negotiated returns, despite the model’s flaws, a viable means of reducing the number of people in SDF custody. “The SDF have been saying for years, ‘tell us a better way’. They’ve been asking for help. Well, there’s no help coming, and I don’t see anyone proposing a better way,” said Ms Khalifa.Allow young people to dip into pension pots to fund first home deposit, says Housing SecretaryD-Day veterans prepare to set sail for Normandy 75 years after invasion Men with prostate cancer offered hope by “search and destroy” treatmentComment: Sajid Javid can deliver Brexit - and fuse \u0026#39white-van Conservatism\u0026#39 with metropolitan ToriesWhy Tory leadership candidates are being urged to avoid live TV hustings \u0026#39like the plague\u0026#39Comment: Conservatives must address our country\u0026#39s shocking educational disparitiesWild swimmers revolt over British Triathlon efforts to prevent people swimming in cold waterBoris Johnson plans to spend at least £5,000 on every secondary school pupil in first domestic policy pledgeFrench must do more to stop Channel crossings, says immigration official Two five-year-old girls swept out to sea on blow-up swan after RNLI warning to parents over \u0026#34deadly\u0026#34 inflatablesComment: It’s never too \u2028late for Michael Caine to play an ageing criminalJeremy Hunt hints at Huawei climbdown as Donald Trump sets off for State visitThere is no point sending your children to Eton because education is in your genes, says geneticist\u0026#39Chinese Ecstasy\u0026#39 drug linked to 125 deaths has arrived in Britain, NCA warns festival goersStop gender-swapping Shakespeare characters because it tampers with the rhythm, former National Theatre director saysComment: The pollsters blatant dishonesty on Brexit is ruining the public trustMeet Ai-Da: the robot artist giving real painters a run for their moneyBusinessman \u0026#39who fathered 14 children\u0026#39 must pay child support to British woman he met on Tinder, judge rulesComment: Jacinda Ardern\u0026#39s trendy \u0026#34wellbeing\u0026#34 metrics are no way to assess an economyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/02/TELEMMGLPICT000170900822_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"no point sending children eton education genes says geneticist","story":"Sending children to private schools like Eton is a waste of time according to a leading scientist Sending children to private schools like Eton is a waste of time because academic success is written in the genes meaning youngsters would do just as well at the local comprehensive, a leading scientist has claimed.Robert Plomin, Professor of Behavioural Genetic at King’s College London, said he and his team had spent decades trying to unpick how much of achievement in education was down to nature or nurture.He concluded that 50 per cent of academic success is due to genes, but they are yet to discover what accounts for the other half. What they do now know, however, is it is not due to schooling or upbringing.Studies have shown that adopted twins with the same genetics do just as well academically even if they have had vastly different education or parents. Although selective schools like Eton achieve higher grades, it is the selection process itself which accounts for the difference, and that same cohort would achieve the same marks if sent to a state school, Prof Plomin argues.Speaking at The Hay Festival, he said: “Do differences in the quality of school make a difference in outcomes like GCSE scores or getting into universities? “There’s a correlation there – kids who go to selective schools have a GCSE score that is one full grade higher than kids who go to comprehensive schools.“But if you correct for what the schools selected on, there’s no difference in GCSE scores. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you select the very best kids academically, yes they go on and do well. But have you added value? The answer is no. ‘So why send your kids to Eton? Don’t. If all you’re doing it for is educational achievement. Schools matter, kids have got to learn all this stuff. But do they make a difference? The answer is no.”Eton currently costs more than £40,000-a-year and 19 of Britain’s Prime Ministers were educated at the school. Prof Plomin accepted that parents may want to send there children to fee-paying schools to mix with the ‘right sort of people’ but said they shouldn’t expect the institutions to improve their grades.Private schools may also instil confidence, leadership skills or connections which improve job prospects in later life, he conceded. Although just seven per cent of children in Britain attended public school, over a third of MPs, half of medical consultants and two thirds of high court judges had a private education. But he added: “Differences in GCSE results for selective and non selective schools are not an index for the quality of education the schools provide. “Even though schools have little effect on inidual differences in school achievement, some parents will still decide to pay huge amounts of money to send their children to private schools in order to give their children whatever alight advantage such schools provide.“I hope it will help parents who cannot afford to pay for private schooling or move house to know that it doesn’t make much of a difference in children’s school achievement.”Allow young people to dip into pension pots to fund first home deposit, says Housing SecretaryD-Day veterans prepare to set sail for Normandy 75 years after invasion Men with prostate cancer offered hope by “search and destroy” treatmentBoris Johnson plans to spend at least £5,000 on every secondary school pupil in first domestic policy pledgeComment: Sajid Javid can deliver Brexit -

swimmers revolt british triathlon efforts prevent people","story":"Wild swimmers have voiced disquiet at British Triathlon over safety adviceWild swimmers have voiced disquiet at British Triathlon over safety advice warning people not to enter waters below 11 degrees, as they claim the coldness helps improve “mental wellbeing”.Last year almost half a million people swam in open water venues such as lakes and lidos, with many hobbyists claiming health benefits are among the attractions to immersing themselves in chilled water.Swimming in colder temperatures can relieve symptoms of depression and improve people’s moods, research by the British Medical Journal Case Reports has found.The number of people regularly taking part in open water swimming rose by over 80 per cent between November 2016 and 2018, according to Sport England.However, enthusiasts have warned the growing trend may come to a halt as a result of the initiative by British Triathlon to encourage more people to compete in the sport.Taking the plunge | How to stay safe when wild swimmingSh2out, which is a partnership between the Royal Life Saving Society UK and British Triathlon set up in 2017, are in the process of asking managed venues if they wish to be accredited in the hope of staging future triathlon competitions.Any deal would involve venues adopting British Triathlon\u0027s safety regulations, which include a recommendation that swimmers do not enter the water if the temperature is below 11 degrees.   Organisers insist the directives will not affect wild swimmers entering venues during the winter, but hobbyists fear any introduction of regulations could cause participation to decline, arguing it would affect the freedom of the discipline.Colin Hill, Founder of Chill Swim, an open water event specialist, said: “There are now more people talking about swimming in cold water for health benefits and mental wellbeing because you feel so refreshed after swimming. “So having people say you can’t swim under certain temperatures just isn’t needed.We have a long tradition of open swimming and we don’t need overreach from a relatively new sport who doesn’t really understand.”20 of Britain\u0026#039s best wild swimming spotsThere are currently 30 UK venues who have Sh2out accreditation, where the operator has been recognised as reaching a minimum safety standard for enthusiasts wanting to swim there.Many organisers of open water swimming sessions seek their professional guidance and benefit from their venue appearing  more secure to the public after they have been approved.However, a sense of unease over a blanket safety standard that does not factor in the different conditions of inidual sites and swimmers has been voiced by many.There is concern among organisers that an increasing number of private venues will feel pressured to adopt the accreditation in reaction to their competitors doing the same.Kate Rew, from the Outdoor Swimming Society who has seen her group\u0027s membership grew from 300 in 2006 to 70,000 members today, added: “Everybody wants people to be safe, but there’s no absolute danger in swimming under 10 degrees that  means it shouldn\u0027t be allowed in a public venue. “It is completely arbitrary to pretend there is a temperature that is safe or not safe to swim- it entirely depends on the inidual and how well acclimatized they are and what their physical health is.”Sh2out dismissed claims that the guidelines will lead to a fall in open water swimming, pointing to the rise in participation rates since their introduction two years ago.A spokesperson  for the Sh2out partnership said: “Whilst we would always encourage swimmers of any age or ability, to take sensible precautions before they swim, it would be naïve to think that anyone could ‘police’ or restrict the desire of someone determined to swim anywhere they chose, through Sh2out or by any other means.“Sh2out is not designed to be a ‘one size fits all’ approach as in practical terms, this simply isn’t possible but rather, Sh2out aims to provide a framework of advice, guidance and support for venues, who want to maximise their water assets and increase their leisure offering, to the communities they serve, however they see fit.“Sh2out is designed to facilitate open water swimming for the benefit of everyone, making it accessible, safe, affordable and inclusive. Swimmers who see accredited venues as ‘restrictive’, ‘regulated’ or ‘killjoys’, are free to swim where they feel better suits their needs.”Allow young people to dip into

Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier. James Mason plays the alcoholic actor whose career is on the wane, while Judy Garland is the supremely talented up-and-coming singer he meets in a nightclub. Although there were two other major screen versions of the story – one in 1937, the other in 1976 starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson – Garland boasts the strongest singing voice of any, and her chemistry with Mason is superb.In this futuristic romance, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with an artificially intelligent computer system, voiced by Scarlett Johannsson. Her – written and directed by Spike Jonze – treats Phoenix\u0027s courtship with all the sensitivity of a flesh-and-blood romance, and what could be a cringe-worthy or facetious premise instead blossoms into a touchingly sincere examination of love in the age of technology.This romcom from 1999 brings Hugh Grant’s down-to-earth bookshop owner into the orbit of an A-list actress played by Julia Roberts, and the unlikeliest of British love affairs ensues. Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier. James Mason plays the alcoholic actor whose career is on the wane, while Judy Garland is the supremely talented up-and-coming singer he meets in a nightclub. Although there were two other major screen versions of the story – one in 1937, the other in 1976 starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson – Garland boasts the strongest singing voice of any, and her chemistry with Mason is superb.In this futuristic romance, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with an artificially intelligent computer system, voiced by Scarlett Johannsson. Her – written and directed by Spike Jonze – treats Phoenix\u0027s courtship with all the sensitivity of a flesh-and-blood romance, and what could be a cringe-worthy or facetious premise instead blossoms into a touchingly sincere examination of love in the age of technology.This romcom from 1999 brings Hugh Grant’s down-to-earth bookshop owner into the orbit of an A-list actress played by Julia Roberts, and the unlikeliest of British love affairs ensues. Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others.

And then the part where he’s like, ‘I don’t have a problem Sasha, what’s your problem?’ and starts air fighting, he improvised that as well.”Wong stars in the film alongside Randall Park and Lost actor Daniel Dae Kim.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was unveiled in 2001\u0026nbspand has powered generations of music listeners, as well as being associated with the rise of both the iPod and the iPhone.But over that same period it has become controversial, becoming a slow and unwieldy piece of software when compared with Apple’s more recent software. It also came to represent a way of listening – buying songs and organising them in a local library –\u0026nbspthat has largely become surpassed by streaming.Apple will kill off the traditional version of iTunes to embrace that new streaming future with an app built to allow users to listen to music, according to a report from Bloomberg, which echoes a series of other leaks.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has announced the new iPod Touch, the first new iPod in four years.

It is likely to keep some of the same features, but drop the older parts of the app that have been accrued over the many years it has been available.As well as the music app, Apple is expected to release separate apps for videos and podcasts, which have also been a part of the iTunes app. The TV version is already available on some platforms, and will soon come to others as well as start offering Apple’s own streaming video service.The app always had a isive reputation, and many will not mourn its demise. While it helped bring about the iPod era and was one of the primary ways for people to store music, it also gradually became more and more bloated and slow as Apple added increasing numbers of functions into the app.It’s likely that Apple will keep iTunes around for a short while, at least in some form. It remains the only way for people to manage older iPod devices that never had internet connections and so can’t stream music.Songs bought through the iTunes Store will also almost certainly stick around, probably being present in the new version of the music app too. But it is unlikely Apple will integrate the store with that app in such a way as to allow people to make new purchases.Apple will begin its WWDC announcements on Monday, in a keynote presentation that will be streamed live on the company’s website and covered minute-by-minute on The Independent.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Okoye briefly mentions that there’s been an underwater earthquake off the coast of Africa and, when Natasha asks her how Wakanda will deal with the incident, she simply says they were going to avoid it.To the casual viewer, this line will bear no weight. However, some Marvel fans have been questioning whether this revealed the existence of Namor, the Sub-Mariner in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Whether this means the character – an underwater mutant – will appear in Black Panther 2 remains to be seen, though director Scott Derrickson recently fuelled speculation he’ll\u0026nbspappear in the\u0026nbspDoctor Strange sequel\u0026nbspafter posting a comic book cover featuring the heroic sorcerer and Namor\u0026nbspon Twitter.New leak \u0027reveals\u0027 every film Marvel will release over next decadeConsidering Derrickson\u0026nbspwent on to\u0026nbspdelete the tweet, it\u0026nbspseems likely that\u0026nbspNamor could one day face off against Benedict Cumberbatch’s character.Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has spoken about his desire to get Namor in the MCU, but admitted that acquiring film rights to the character have proved difficult.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else.

But as with other attempts to bring back the BlackBerry brand, it largely failed.That failure brought an end to the service that was many people\u0027s first experience with the chat apps that have come to dominate the phone market.

We hope you will cherish many fond memories of BBM consumer service that helped shape messenger platforms to become what they are today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On YouTube alone, people watch more than a billion hours of video each day.The issues lasted for more than an hour before Google claimed to have located the issue and said it had been fixed.We are experiencing high levels of network congestion in the eastern USA, affecting multiple services in Google Cloud, G Suite and YouTube, a note on Google\u0027s page reads.\u0026nbspUsers may see slow performance or intermittent errors.

Hang tight!Though it might not be obvious to users of the apps or services themselves, much\u0026nbspof the underlying infrastructure of the web is provided by just a few companies. That means that issues at one of those firms – such as Google or Amazon – can very quickly cause problems across the internet, taking down websites that might appear entirely separate from those suffering the problems.In 2017, for instance, large parts of the internet stopped working because of an issue at Amazon Web Services, which caused problems at\u0026nbspQuora, Trello and some of the world\u0027s biggest news sites. That was later traced back to one small typo in the company\u0027s code, which caused underlying infrastructure to break and websites to stop working.Similarly, in 2016, a vast cyber attack focused on Dyn, which also provides some of the infrastructure that keeps the web breaking. That meant websites like Spotify, Reddit and Twitter all went down.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love.

If people are really psyched about it, I’d be psyched about it too. So we’ll see.”The band’s initial split in 1999 was mired in acrimony. During their final concert, at London’s Brixton Academy, Malkmus attached a pair of handcuffs to his microphone stand and told the audience: “These symbolise what it’s like being in a band all these years.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself.

What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage.

In our election manifesto, people were promised a deal.”So far, cabinet ministers Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Matt\u0026nbspHancock\u0026nbsphave thrown their hats into the ring to replace Ms May, while up-and-comers such as Brexit minister James Cleverly\u0026nbspare trying\u0026nbsptheir luck.Outside candidate Rory Stewart, the international development secretary,\u0026nbsphas won praise\u0026nbspafter he set off around the country to meet the public, armed with a selfie stick.His hopes were bolstered by an endorsement by justice secretary David Gauke, who said Mr Stewart was a “strong contender”.Mr Gauke also said he could not serve in a cabinet that was pursuing a no-deal Brexit but acknowledged it was important to keep the idea\u0026nbspon the table.Former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom said she would take the UK out of the EU by the end of October in a “managed exit” – and ruled out renegotiating Ms May’s deal.Ms Leadsom, whose\u0026nbspresignation triggered Ms May’s departure, said the prime minister’s deal was “dead” as the EU would not reopen it and MPs have rejected it.Mr Javid, the home secretary, said he\u0026nbspwanted to leave the EU on 31 October as planned but he did not explicitly rule out a delay to Brexit.\u0026nbspHe told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “I want to leave with a deal but if I have to choose between no deal and no Brexit,\u0026nbspI would pick no deal.”Pressed on the matter, he said: “That’s not something I would do, but we are a parliamentary democracy and what we’ve seen in the last few months is parliament has taken on some extraordinary powers to initiate its own legislation so if it’s statute, if it’s the law, I would not break the law if I was prime minister, of course I would observe the law.”Elsewhere, Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, warned candidates against supporting a no-deal exit as they had a “brief opportunity to reset the political agenda”.Ms Rudd is regarded as a possible kingmaker in the upcoming contest, as she heads up a 60-strong caucus of moderate Tories.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He aims to sell himself as an effective leader who is open to compromise and evidences this with his experience as governorOhio representative Tim Ryan will be running a campaign that hinges on his working class rootsIn a May op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, he wrote that he was “running to save” the “only economic system that can support a strong middle class”.In an interview, Mr Hickenlooper said he had spoken “inartfully”, and that he did not mean to single out any of his opponents, though Bernie Sanders\u0026nbspis the only self-identified “democratic socialist” seeking the White House.“We’ve got to clearly show that we reject socialism,” Mr\u0026nbspHickenlooper said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to do that because Republicans will try to make us into socialists even if we’re not. If we’re not willing to draw a bright line and say we’re not socialists, we could quite possibly re-elect this president.”Some in the audience disagreed with Mr Hickenlooper’s thinking.Republicans aim to demonise Democrats as ‘baby killers’ and socialistsJonathan Tasini, a labour activist who endorsed Mr Sanders in 2016 and published a book about the senator’s ideas, said that Mr Hickenlooper had effectively talked his way out of the 2020 race.“Every single presidential candidate came into this hall was treated with respect,” Mr Tasini said. “He red-baited us and got down in the mud, and I think it finished him.”Mr Hickenlooper’s allies saw it differently, speculating that the cold reception at a convention dominated by liberal activists would help distinguish the governor to moderate Democratic voters.Asked how the booing might play on Fox News, which has devoted hours of coverage to the rise of socialists inside the party, Mr Hickenlooper said it would help.“I think what it says is that we are having that discussion as Democrats, and my hope is that we will clearly say, a result of those broadcasts, that Democrats are not socialists,” he said.13th moviesOther Democrats have taken opportunities to distinguish themselves from the party’s left flank.Michael Bennet of Colorado, who joined the race last month, told one of his New Hampshire audiences that he had stood and applauded during the State of the Union, when President Trump said that America would “never be a socialist country”.“In my part of the country, when you call somebody a socialist, or when they call themselves socialists, it makes it harder for them to get elected.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So I’m hoping he might help,” she adds.The Diab\u0026nbspfamily is comparatively well off for Gaza, a 25-mile militant-run enclave that is home to 1.9 million people, over half of whom live below the poverty line.A league of champions: Gaza amputees tackle despair with footballThey were given the cello by a rights group that managed to secure permission from the Israelis, who frequently ban goods into Gaza on the grounds parts could be used by militants to make weapons.But the instrument is fairly useless. Gaza’s last cello teacher, a Romanian woman, left the enclave last year. The enthusiastic teenager scratches out a scale for her virtual guest.The idea for the Ramadan chats was pioneered by peace activist Rami Aman, 37, who founded the Gaza Youth Committee in 2010, maximising one of the few resources Gaza has, the internet, to reach the world.The committee has both Muslim and Christian members as well as Jewish supporters in Israel and across the world.Aman tells\u0026nbspThe Independent he chose to focus on the US this year as he worries that the policies of President\u0026nbspTrump, often\u0026nbspperceived to be anti-Palestinian, are\u0026nbspskewing the American perception of Palestinian civilians.UK unveils £1.6m aid package for GazaTrump advisor uses video of Belarus to attack Ilhan Omar’s Gaza stanceHamas urge restraint in Gaza protests as truce holds during EurovisionThousands march in London to support Palestinians after Gaza violence1 million could go hungry in Gaza in ‘humanitarian catastrophe’Trump sparked anger here after he recognised the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, questioned the definition of a Palestinian refugee and slashed all funding to the United Nations’\u0026nbspPalestinian refugee agency that is a lifeline for thousands\u0026nbspof families in Gaza.Over the last month,\u0026nbspAman has also connected Gazan civilians with those in the West Bank, in a bid to override a bitter political spat between the rival political bodies that rule the two Palestinian territories.They also hold regular Skype meetings with Israeli citizens living just across the border fence to try to build bridges. \u0026nbsp“We think the only way to start is with people actually talking to each other and knowing each other,” Aman explains.We think the only way to start is with people actually talking to each other and knowing each other\u0026nbsp“Most of all we want to teach the youth to communicate with the outside world without violence.”Eran Heyman, a software developer from New Jersey, recently met a group of Gaza electronics students through the Ramadan Skypes.

Here is everything you need to know about it.Eid or Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, which is a month of fasting that starts on May  and finishes on June  in .It is an important religious holiday for Muslims and is a day when they are not permitted to fast.It kick-starts the month of Shawwal, which begins with a feast to end the period of fasting.The celebration is a public holiday in many Muslim countries, but is not one in the UK, despite a campaign for it to be recognised back in .During Eid, Muslims will often purchase new clothes for the occasion, and take part in festivals and celebrations.Many will wake up early to pray at a mosque or outdoor prayer venue.Gts and cards are often exchanged among friends and family.Eid means celebration and Mubarak means blessed, often Eid Mubarak is used as a greeting over this period.In , Eid starts on the evening of Wednesday, June , and finishes the following day.The dates can be adjusted slightly nearer the time due to lunar sightings and changes each year.This is because the Islamic calendar - known as the Umm al-Qura calendar - is based on the moon’s cycle, whereas the Gregorian one is determined by the sun.As the two don’t align, the Islamic dates move back by around  days each year.As well as Eid al-Fitr, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha.Eid al-Adha will begin on the evening of August , , which falls in the middle of the th and final month in the Islamic calendar.The celebration revolves around when Allah appeared to Ibrahim in a dream and asked him to sacrice his son, Ishmael, as a sign of his faith.It’s similar to the Christian and Jewish stories in which God asked Abraham to sacrice his son Isaac, but spared him from doing so.During this time, Muslims traditionally sacrice animals, in Britain this is done in a slaughterhouse, and the meat is ided up among friends, family and the needy.It finishes on Thursday, August ."},{"url":null,"title":"what ramadan 2019 timetable prayer fasting iftar suhur","story":"Muslims must fast during daylight hours in Ramadan, so it is important they closely observe the hours of sunset and sunrise.

Instead they smear just over half the country as backward-looking and beyond help.Even Michel Barnier seems to think it’s because we’re pining for the days of Empire, rather than to take control of our laws and borders.If the Second Referendum crowd really think Britain is about to change its mind — despite the huge number of votes for the Brexit Party last week — they need to think again.Every time people like Wheatcroft open their mouths, they give one more reason we’re better off out.IT is naive to think education is free.So the idea that you could deliver university courses without somebody paying just isn’t realistic.Tuition fees are necessary.

Always apply sun cream when you’ll be in the sun. Don’t forget to wait  mins before venturing out. You can burn on a cloudy day too so wear sunscreen evenits not sunny. Reapply, reapply, reapply. You can burn in the UK too. Make sure youre using the correct SPFOver half Brits admitted they regularly miss areas of the body when applying sun protection.These are the areas that people are most likely to miss when applying sun cream, and how many of us dont apply sun cream to this area while outdoors.. Soles of the feet -  per cent. Bottom -  per cent. Hairline parting -  per cent. Lips -  per cent. Eyelids -  per centLauren Mackenzie, head of medical aesthetics at The Hospital Group, said: “Skin cancer is one of the biggest killers in the UK, so it’s quite shocking to see the risks Brits are taking when it comes to failing to protect their skin from sun damage.It seems from our research that most people are seriously underestimating the protection needed and aren’t giving sun cream application the appropriate time and attention.“Spending an extra five minutes applying sun cream and waiting for it to start working before jumping in the water on holiday are really simple changes to make, but will certainly save your skin in the long term.Practices like this can protect you from premature ageing and more serious damage that the sun can have on your body.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boris rev up leadership campaign","story":"Having kept a low profile for the past few days, he will unveil his most senior supporter yet, with Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, set to endorse him.The Boris campaign will also unveil a slew of MPs backing him, which will put him ahead in the endorsement stakes.But just as signicant as the number supporting him is the fact that Boris’s old enemies are beginning to make peace with him. I understand that ious MPs have been to see him to say that while they won’t vote for him, they would accept his leadership.One MP who won’t be endorsing him, though, is Amber Rudd. She and Boris sat down on Thursday. But ultimately the dferences between them over Brexit policy are too great to make any kind of dream ticket work.I understand that Rudd pushed the former Foreign Secretary to budge on his commitment that the UK would leave the EU on October  with or without a deal. Johnson would not. Rudd felt that she could not support someone holding this position.Another complication was that Johnson and Rudd’s dferences on Brexit made it very hard for them to agree on a joint governing agenda. Johnson, though, should still have more votes in the first round than any other Brexiteer candidate.He needs to finish  votes clear of Dominic Raabhe is to establish himself as the clear Leave choice — Raab is more likely than him to pick up support as the second tier Brexiteer candidates drop out.As one of those backing Boris puts it: “He’s got to get as close as possible to a third on the first round.” The support of a third of MPs guarantees you a place in the members’ run-off.The problem for the former London Mayor, as this supporter acknowledges, is that “ there’s ever a perception that Boris was falling back then that would be compounded”.On the Cabinet side of the contest, Sajid Javid is attempting to reboot his campaign by today setting out his plan for how to deal with the Irish border issue.One of those backing him tells me it is “not just how you voted in the referendum, but your ability to implement no deal or negotiate with the EU” that matters. This supporter argues that Johnson and Raab aren’t going to get anything out of Brussels, while Javid might.The Cabinet side of the contest is becoming increasingly fractured. I understand that the Cabinet Ministers most opposed to No Deal have privately agreed to back either Matt Hancock or Rory Stewart in the first round. Both are running interesting campaigns.Stewart is out doing social media walkabouts, while Hancock is making arguments that the other candidates are being forced to follow. I’m told that next week he will propose a levy on betting companies to fund treatment for gambling addiction.The energy of these campaigns is causing trouble for the more established Cabinet contenders. I understand that backers of one of them are now warning MPs: “Go to bed with Hancock, wake up with Boris.”But Jeremy Hunt’s biggest problem is the sense that, in the words of one senior Tory, he is a “completely wasted place” in the final two as it is hard to see how he could beat a Brexiteer candidate.This is why a growing number of Tories think the party is “heading to the destined psycho-drama” of a Boris Gove run-off.BATTEN down the hatches, hurricane Donald is blowing into town. As his interview in this newspaper demonstrates, Donald Trump won’t be governed by the normal diplomatic conventions on his State visit.He is more than happy to make known his admiration for Boris Johnson, despite the Tory leadership contest. Though some of the rival camps think Trump’s blessing will be a double-edged sword.It is the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who will greet Trump on his arrival, which will give Hunt the chance to burnish his statesman credentials. Hunt will also be involved in Tuesday’s Downing Street talks between Trump and Mrs May.Penny Mordaunt, the Defence Secretary, who is expected to throw her hat into the leadership ring, will meet with the President’s daughter, Ivanka, to discuss female economic empowerment.Trump is not an easy President to deal with. But he is the leader of our closest and most important security ally. UK politicians must also realise that on ious issues, including China and the role of Huawei in G networks, the Trump position represents the new political consensus in the US.The UK would be mad to endanger its most import- ant intelligence relationship over this issue.THE next test for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party comes on Thursday, with the Peterborough by-election.If Farage’s party can win, it will show how Brexit has redrawn the political landscape. It will give the Brexit Party a toe-hold in Parliament and a chance to become a formidable political force.Butthe Brexit Party can’t take a seat which voted heavily for Leave in the aftermath of its Labour MP being sent to prison, then its current momentum will be checked.CABINET on Tuesday has been cancelled. This is surprising given that it didn’t meet this week as Parliament was in recess. The official reason for it not taking place is that there is too much on with the Trump visit and D-Day commemorations.But as one minister points out to me, it is hard to believe that Cabinet would have been cancelledit hadn’t been for the fact that Theresa May is resigning as Tory party leader at the end of the week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is the Cabinet.It is not only Theresa May who let down Conservative Party voters, members and supporters.She was abetted and supported by her Cabinet. In this country we operate a system of collective responsibility and it is not good enough for Cabinet members now to claim they held a dferent view or would have done things dferently.How can it be right that Cabinet Ministers, who were complicit with the failed Brexit polices of Chequers, the Withdrawal Agreement and the subsequent betrayal of Brexit, credibly seek to claim they are an acceptable choice for this role They were sat around the top table when decisions were made and must take responsibility for them.I would sup with a very long spoon indeed with those who are complicit but now claiming they can offer the Party new leadership and direction.The British public are not stupid and our Party members know what they are voting for.They wont be fooled by those born-again ‘Leavers’, who trumpet their devotion to Brexit even though they have done nothing for the last three years to advance theof British sovereignty.The British public and our long suffering Party members know where the responsibility for the greatest breach of trust in our democratic institutions lies.After three years of being repeatedly told that ‘nothing has changed’, the time has come for ‘everything to change’.The British people are desperate for our country to leave the EU on st October. They are crying out for leadership which will put the country and our people first.The European Elections clearly reflect that and anybody who has knocked on doors or engaged the public in recent times knows that.We simply must move on and move out of the EU and fast.And in doing so we must move into a trade negotiation as has been outlined through numerous proposals over the last  months.Unfortunately Theresa May’s Cabinet showed themselves unwilling to listen to detailed proposals which would have a delivered the genuine Brexit the public voted for.So now the priority is to exit the European Union and move forward to negotiating a future relationship with protects British interests and keeps open the global prizes and benefits of Brexit which the British people voted for.Ministers who claim they are pro-brexit have failed to stand up for the . million who voted to leave and make that robust case to deliver the referendum mandate.The people were promised we would have left the EU months ago and that ‘no deal was better than a bad deal’.Having danced to the tune of the tune of the EU, spent billions of pounds on ‘no deal’ preparations, our country must just get on and leave the EU.Too many people in our political class lack confidence in our country and trust in the public. They have sought the comfort of the EU making our laws rather than making the decisions themselves. No wonder the British people feel betrayed.They expected the UK to leave the EU on th March as they were promised. Every day longer we remain in the EU adds salt to that wound.The governing class has broken trust in our politics.The British people voted to take back control and for Britain to be free, independent and self-governing again. Our destiny is as a global beacon of free trade, not a satellite of the EU.The Conservative Party must quit the navel-gazing and stop the rot of this Brexit betrayal.Those of us who believe in our Country and people, who respect our democratic and political freedoms, will continue to stand up for our liberty to make sure the days of betrayal are over.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I take them at their word - so on that basis the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead.Instead, I have a pragmatic three-step plan - a plan to deliver Brexit in a way that protects citizens of the UK and the EU, delivers certainty to businesses, and maintains the integrity of our United Kingdom.No more preicating. No more fearmongering. And no more limbo. Just compassionate and decisive action that demonstrates leadership.My first step will be to take sensible measures to enshrine certain agreements into law, and to protect our people.I will immediately introduce key legislation to address this.First, I will introduce a citizens’ rights bill. EU citizens who have built lives here, and UK citizens who have made their homes in the EU must have the weight of uncertainty lted from their shoulders.Second, I will introduce a bill that locks in the mutually beneficial measures that have already been agreed between the UK and EU.This will cover areas like citizens’ rights in Gibraltar, our sovereign bases overseas, security and intelligence-sharing relationships, transport, data, and medicines.It is in everyone’s interest to put these agreed arrangements in place, and I believe many MPs would support this, regardless of how they voted in the referendum.The second step is to give businesses and industry the confidence and certainty they need to plan for a managed exit. I want them to be able to invest, hire, and innovate with renewed optimism.So we will ramp up preparations for our managed exit, focusing efforts on delivering alternative arrangements for the Northern Ireland border with the EU.Our continued strong bond with Northern Ireland will be protected.There are some sensitive sectors that rely upon ‘just-in-time’ supply chains, like automotive and aerospace. I know how important these are, and we will propose specic regulatory agreements with the EU for these.For other industries, like medicines and agri-foods, we will seek specic customs agreements on tarfs and non-tarf barriers. This will protect trade in the most vital goods and services but allow us to embrace new free trade deals around the world.At the core of this work will be open communication to Parliament, the public, and EU colleagues about progress, to build an environment of confidence and certainty. Parliament will receive regular updates, and households and businesses will receive communication from government that provides clear information about our managed exit.Transparency will be at the heart of everything I do - it’s what parliament expects, and it’s what the public deserves.The third step will be to lead a delegation of UK Ministers to meet with the EU Council and the proposed new EU Commissioners, to talk directly about the wide-ranging preparations we are making for a managed exit on October .Discussions will culminate in a UK EU summit, in September, in Belfast and Dublin, where the EU Council and proposed Commission will be invited to agree which measures we will all accept, to ensure a properly managed exit.As Prime Minister, I will not advocate an extension of any kind, and it will be clear that in all circumstances the UK will leave the EU at the end of October. With comprehensive arrangements in place, we will be prepared for any eventuality.We owe it to the country, and to our strong democratic tradition, to fulfil the instruction that our voters gave us.I am a passionate, pragmatic and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the EU. We can demonstrate to the world that the UK remains a beacon for opportunity, fairness and democratic leadership. We can restore that vital trust between politics and the people.It’s not too late to take advantage of the opportunities we hoped for in voting Leave.

NEF’s Hanna Wheatley says: “Finding a decent, affordable place to live is becoming harder and harder for people and families across the country.    “A key part of this is the overinflated price of land dictating what gets built on it. “Public land,it must be sold, represents an opportunity to produce the kinds of homes people need, but the Government’s approach to the public land sale is a shambles. “There is a clear tension between trying to raise as much money as possible from the land sale and also building the kind of homes we need — and right now the Government isn’t doing either. “The one-off cash injection gained by selling land to the highest bidder is small compensation for the lost opportunity of more affordable housing, and a reduction in the housing benefit bill, she added.

Sajid Javid said today he will look at removing the p rate of income taxhe becomes the next Prime Minister, to inject dynamism into the economy. The rate applies to earnings over £, a year, an income that is attained by only % to % of taxpayers. According to   figures, the most recent available, the highest-earning % of taxpayers had an income of £, or over. The richest % had an income of £, or over. Mr Javid told the Sundaythat while his priority was to cut the basic rate of income tax - affecting millions of middle- and lower-earners - he wanted to look at higher rates too. The Home Secretary said: If it can be demonstrated that a further cut in the additional rate can raise more taxable revenues, that should be looked at.    If I was Prime Minister, my intent would be to do as much as I can to keep cutting taxes on personal income.

It was early on Tuesday, June ,  and the young Tommy had just battled his way up a Normandy beach, dodging bullets, landmines and the mutilated bodies of his brothers in arms. As all hell broke loose that D-Day morning George had saved two pals from drowning, pulling the non-swimmers out of the waves at Gold Beach as German gunners strafed the shore. An officer had called out for his name and number promising: “You’ll get a medal for this, son.” But George, , did not think he would survive long enough to get a gong pinned on his chest. He did not even fancy his chances of getting through the next few hours. Staring into the distance he says: “It was too much... all too much. Total bloody chaos.    “I’d just kept pushing forward, towards a pillbox in the corner of the beach. But the lads in front of me were going down, one by one. “It wasn’t until the airforce came over, pushing the Germans back, that we managed to make some progress. I kept thinking about June, my new we. “Because the previous Tuesday was our wedding night. It was only a week since we were cuddled up together on a tiny, shilling-a-night bed. “I wonderedI’d ever see, or speak to June again.” George did make it through and over the next weeks and months made huge advances helping to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. And he made it back to his bride in Blighty and a happy marriage lasting  years. He got that bravery medal too – but not until  when the French awarded him the Legion d’Honneur. And this week,  years on, he will be back on Gold Beach remembering the , Allied comrades who never made it. The Cha Pensioner, now , is one of  veterans sailing to Normandy on a Royal British Legion cruise.    George, who boarded the MV Boudicca at Dover with the other veterans yesterday, said: “We’re all getting on now. “I’ve been back to Normandy seven times over the years and I even met the Queen when I was there for the th anniversary. But every time I go I think, ‘Where’s Tommy ’. “They’re all passing away so this really feels like our last chance to thank the ones who didn’t make it back. This anniversary will also remind all the youngsters what we achieved – what we fought for.” George grew up in the tough East End of London in the s and was a keen and amateur boxer. Called up for Army service in , he was a highly skilled gunner and deployed to the Middle East with the Desert Rats.  He ed to England as a driver for a Brigadier preparing for Operation Overload, codename for the Battle of Normandy. George was dating June, a WAAF working with barrage balloons. One day he introduced her to his boss, “Afterwards the Brigadier said, ‘Your fiancee is very attractive Skipper’, and out of the blue I said, ‘Yes sir, we’re getting married soon’. “I don’t know why. I had no intention and we had no bloody money. But I decided to propose that night. “I borrowed £ for a ring from a pawn broker and we arranged to marry on Tuesday, May .“We had four plates of lettuce sandwiches and four quarts of brown ale and I got flowers from abloke’s allotment. “We went to Suffolk for the honeymoon night but I was back at base by Wednesday night. And a few days later we were shipped off to join the fleet for Normandy.” George went on: “We pulled out just after midnight and a mile from shore the landing craft came alongside. “I got in and they let the tailboard down saying, ‘Jump in, the water’s only knee height’. But there was a bomb crater and it was up to my neck. I was lucky. I could swim but two others next to me were almost drowning. “I got out, took my pack off and jumped in again to pull the other two out. Then I picked my gun up and went forward. I never saw the two again. It was hell. “I was only . There was the naval bombardment, the infantry, Germans with guns firing. Chaos. I still wonder how I made it.” The campaign took George into Belgium then Holland and finally into Hamburg before he was transferred to the Royal Army Service Corps. George shakes his head. “I still don’t know how I made it. I got to come back to my we but a lot of my mates never did. It was just chance. “Now I’ve the chance to go back and thank them... for the last time.”    Returning to Normandy to remember the fallen They had suitcases instead of kit bags, clutched walking sticks not rles and wore jaunty berets and Panama hats a substitute of the old tin helmets. But as they filed up the gangplank of the ship bound for France the  veterans of D-Day still had hearts bursting with pride and dignity. Seventy-five years after they left Blighty to liberate Europe and defeat Hitler’s Nazis, these now-elderly soldiers, sailors and airmen were ing to Normandy to pay tribute to the comrades who never came home. A Royal British Legion-chartered ship, the Boudicca, is taking them on a cruise along the south coast of England before crossing the channel for services in Bayeux and Arromanches on Thursday. And yesterday the honoured passengers, aged from  to , were welcomed aboard in Dover with music, singing, dancing and even a surprise rendition of Sailing from Rod Stewart. One of the first to arrive was Frederick Adamson, , from Coningsborough near Doncaster. He served in the th West Riding Division of the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, known as the Polar Bears because of their service in Iceland. Helped by his grandson, Philip, Fred beamed as he was played onboard by the Dover Sea Cadets Band. “My word,” he said. “We certainly didn’t get a welcome like that  years ago!”  Jim Docherty, , an Able Seaman deployed on the destroyer HMS Obedient, had travelled from Scotland for the trip with his son, Joe, . He only found out that his father had served on D-Day when he was invited on the trip five months ago. Jim said: “I’ve never ed to Normandy before - it’s not something I wanted to remember. But this could be our last chance.” Rear Admiral John Roberts, , from Whitstable, was serving as a sub lieutenant on HMS Serapis on D-Day. He said: “There were bombers, battleships – everything was firing at the shore but it was a success. “We caught the Germans by surprise. They didn’t think we were going to come there.” There was also a touching recorded message from the Forces’ sweetheart, Dame Vera Lynn, . She said: “Hello boys, Vera Lynn here.

Months before she had visited the doctors reporting her concerns but she was too young for a smear test and doctors initially diagnosed her with Crohnaposs disease.But the -year-old, halfway through her chemotherapy, is remaining positive about her future, reports Teesside Live.   She is determined to live the rest of her le - however long it may be - to the fullest, making special memories with those closest to her. Top of the list is marrying her partner of four years Leighanne Prior. The couple had planned to get hitched in Las Vegas within the next few years. But following Katieaposs diagnosis, they agreed to bring the date forward and will wed in July at Middlesbrough Registry Office. This will be followed by a dream honeymoon in the Males in January. On her breaks from treatment, Katie has enjoyed several days away and short breaks.. She recently spent a weekend away with Leighanne in Newcastle where the pair enjoyed relaxing spa treatments and drinks on the town. Katie is still compiling her list of ambitions and laughed when she revealed one of them is to finish all the Real Housewives series!

I want to make memories with my nephew Jackson - heaposs my best friend - and I canapost wait to meet my baby niece who is due on July , she said.    Iaposm going to Scarborough with Jackson and Leighanne for two nights and then we have our hen weekend so weaposre really looking forward to that. To be honest the only day I feel really down is the day before my chemotherapy. I have a little bit of a wobble but I donapost think about it all the time. I can go days without thinking about it. And I have a massive support system - we have a party of people at each chemo session! But despite staying positive about the future, Katie does get frustrated - as she believes her cancer should have been detected earlier. NHS England and the Clinical Commissioning Group is looking into Katieaposs case. A spokesman for the CCG said they cannot comment at this time as an investigation is being carried out.    She said her symptoms had pointed towards cervical cancer but referrals for smears were turned down because of her age. Women are invited for cervical screening from ages  to . Cervical screening is not recommended for anyone under  due to a belief that it could lead to unnecessary treatment for younger women. Katie believes the minimum age should be lowered to save the lives of more young women. She said she started to experience stomach pains in July last year and went to the doctors in the November. They took some swabs and said I was booked in for a smear, she said. But when I went back they said they werenapost going to do the smear and I was diagnosed with Crohnaposs Disease. The pain never went with the medication they gave me for that. My oncologist has said I never had anything wrong with my bowel or I wouldnapost have been able to go on this type of chemotherapy.    In February, Katie collapsed in pain at Next where she works and spent three nights in hospital. Because of my age I was still declined a smear and when the pains went they sent me home, she said. My GP had sent two gynae referrals in the December and January but both were declined. All my symptoms have always been the same. And when I Googled them they always brought up cervical cancer. The third referral was accepted, she said, and the results of a subsequent smear and scan brought Katieaposs world crashing down. She was told she had stage three cancer which had spread to both sides of her pelvis. When they said cervical cancer I canapost remember anything after. I just remember getting home, she said. It was all a blur. So when the oncologist later ran through it all with me I thought aposI donapost want to have this conversation againapos so I made sure I took everything in and understood it all. Chemotherapy treatment began mid-April and she will undergo six sessions. I was told the prognosis was  months but that is without treatment, she said. As everybody is dferent they canapost really say.  I could take fantastically to the treatment or it might not work. So each scan will tell us more.   Katie and Leighanne met four years ago through friends at a Halloween party.Leighanne has taken time off work to cope with the news and take care of her partner.

However she became so exasperated over the phone that the call handler became worried for her safety and called . While the OAP agreed she was stressed when talking to the call handler, she believes that his decision to involve the emergency services was ridiculous. The mother-of-one, said: The situation has been dragging on for months. I was told to stay in for a five day period and someone would be along, so I stayed in and nobody came. It got so bad I have been in touch with my MP Andrew Bridgen.    On Tuesday, May , I called the number I had been given with a query about my bill and I was getting nowhere. The man on the other end of the phone kept asking me how I am going to pay the bill and then he asked me what medication I am on. I couldn’t believe it. He kept rabbiting on and that is when I said aposoh get me off of this world.apos I had simply had enough of dealing with them. That is when the operator told me he thought that he should call the police and I would need to see social services. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was laughing and said apossend them allapos. I had never heard anything so ridiculous. Mrs Haynes, who suffers from a number of health problems including asthma and type  diabetes, said that after the conversation ended, she was fixing a pot of tea and some lunch, when there was a knock at the door. She said: I opened the door to see two paramedics and I askedthey had got the wrong house. They asked meI was Audrey Haynes. I knew right away E.ON had sent them. I invited them in and they interviewed me.My blood pressure was  because of the stress and they said it was a wonder I didn’t have a heart attack.I thought it was a sheer waste of time when other people needed an ambulance. I never said I wanted to commit suicide. The incident has caused frustration among Mrs Haynes’ relatives, including her nephew Steve Taylor, who said the call from E.ON to the paramedics was nonsense and a waste of time.    He said: My aunty is very determined for her age and quite capable of fighting her own corner, but this was the final straw. She was frustrated and very flippantly said, aposget me off this worldapos. It was only a throwaway comment as she was so fed up of the experience with E.ON but the next thing she knew the paramedics were at her door, responding to allegations she was a suicide threat. Mr Taylor, who lives in Woodville, said the emergency services staff spent two hours with Mrs Haynes trying to determine whether she was suicidal, before she was taken to Burton’s Queen’s Hospital with concerns over her high blood pressure. He said: It was just a load of nonsense, a waste of our time and of hospital resources. E.ON alleged she was a suicide threat but I can assure you that nobody could be further away from that. It is E.ON that has caused the stress and I think she has been massively inconvenienced. Even more than that, I think they endangered her health. Although Mr Taylor admits the staff at the call centre may have been carrying out a duty of care when the contacted the emergency services, he said the confusion could have easily been avoided. He said: I suppose they could argue that it was their duty of carethey thought someone had threatened suicide. But I think the conversation I had with the call centre, which was based in South Africa, showed that it would not be dficult for things to get lost in translation. Mr Taylor, , who is a district councillor for Woodville and Hartshorne, said he wouldnapost be surprisedothers were experiencing similar problems. He said: I spent most of the afternoon trying to call them but they were constantly engaged. When I did get through, they were very unhelpful. I found them impossible to speak to. Quite frankly, it frustrated me - so goodness knows what it would do to old people who are not in a position to speak up for themselves. My aunty is very resilient and used to work in social services so she is used to sorting out problems for elderly people, but she shouldn’t have to be putting up with that. I think the experience was totally unacceptable and I want E.ON to know about the consequences they had created. E.ON says it is sorry Mrs Haynes has had a stressful experience - but insists the call handler did the right thing by calling the emergency services. A spokesman for the company said: Mrs Haynes is on our aposread assistapos register which means she receives a bill based on actual meter readings every quarter.

Betsy Ella-Rose Angela Teft was born prematurely at  weeks and five days at .am on June , . She weighed lbs oz.Just two days after she was born and as her siblings were preparing to meet her for the first time, Besty suddenly fell unresponsive, Lincolnshire Live reported.At the end of a y inquest designed to unravel the mystery surrounding her death the family have no clue why their little girl died.   After Betsy was born she was was transferred to neonatal unit where she received antibiotics for suspected sepsis .She vomited several times over the next  hours, something doctors put down to harmless reflux. During her second day Betsy was diagnosed with mild jaundice and began a course of photo therapy. While her mum Sharna Schaffarczyk had popped home to pick up her other two children Betsy was placed in the hospitalaposs main nursery. When the mum ed a nurse went to hand the baby over only to notice she was unresponsive, blue and not breathing. She was resuscitated and her heartbeat had ed within  minutes. Eleven hours later doctors determined that her condition was unsurvivable, leading mum Sharna and dad Ben Teft to agree that active treatment should be stopped. A post mortem examination found no signs of congenital abnormality or infection, with doctors ruling her mumaposs use of anti-depressant during pregnancy unlikely the cause.    Senior Coroner for Lincolnshire Timothy Brennand said that none of a number of theoretically possible potential natural and unnatural causes of death could be established on the balance of probabilities. Mr Brennand, who reached an open conclusion, said: The full extent of options as to the medical cause of death is limited by the fact that the placenta had been removed. United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust will respond in  days setting out a programme of responses following a serious incident review where a number of suboptimal findings had been made. Mum Sharna said in a statement read to the inquest that she had many unanswered questions. She said: I want to find out who was watching my daughter. Why did no-one find her [unresponsive] before. We were told she was the healthiest and fittest baby in ICU but she needed to be there because she was premature. She added: I found it extremely hard to cope after losing Betsy. I keep thinking that one day the door will open and there will be Betsy. I will never ever get over losing our baby.  Itaposs not something any parent should have to endure. A spokesman for United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust said: “We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Betsy Teft.

Up to  Jamieaposs Italian staff in Scotland claim they were refused redundancy pay are are to launch legal action for lost wages. The kitchen and waiting staff in Edinburgh and Glasgow allege £, worth of fresh food - including steaks, smoked salmon and vegetables - was dumped in bins after Mr Oliveraposs restaurants were shuttered. The furious employees claim they were dismissed on the spot without redundancy pay - and they say they were sacked via a recorded phone message half an hour after arriving for work, the Daily Record reports.    About , staff – including  in Glasgow and Edinburgh – were laid off with  minutes’ notice when the celebrity chefaposs restaurant chain collapsed on May . Mr Oliver, a father-of-five who lives in a £million th-century Essex mansion and is worth £million, has said he is “deeply saddened” over his empireaposs collapse, citing the perfect storm of conditions including rising rents and food costs, the high street decline, Brexit and the increase in minimum wage. Union Unite Scotland has started “protective award” legal proceedings to claw back pay it believes workers are owed, a potential claim could total millions across the UK. The union, which represents  per cent of Jamieaposs Italian workers in Scotland, is demanding two monthsapos pay to cover unpaid wages, outstanding holidays, notice and redundancy pay.  It claims Mr Oliveraposs company - now in the hands of administrators KPMG - is liable because it failed to provide statutory notice of its demise. Hospitality sector organiser Bryan Simpson said: “The way loyal staff at Jamie’s Italian have been treated by their former employer has been nothing short of disgraceful. “Over  workers were made redundant with only a few hours’ notice, in some cases by phone. “It’s completely unacceptable that a company of this size can collapse without warning and without giving staff adequate notice.  “Our Unite members at Jamie’s Italian shall be submitting a protective award claim for failure to provide statutory notice in accordance with the Employment Rights Act. This may mean a further eight weeks’ wages for our members. “Our message to Jamie’s Italian Ltd and administrators KPMG is simple – pay our members what they are due or we won’t hesitate to take you to court.” The workers claim that Mr Oliver and management gave no indication the firm was in trouble. In August last year, Mr Oliver revealed that his chain was hours from bankruptcy in September  before he rescued it by injecting nearly £million of his own money into the business.  He then shut  of the chainaposs  restaurants and made about  workers redundant in a desperate bid to save the restaurant empire which includes the brands Jamie’s Italian, Barbecoa and Fteen. His international restaurants trading as Jamie’s Italian, Jamie’s Pizzeria and Jamie’s Deli are unaffected. Earlier this year he made an additional £million in funding available. When  of the remaining  branches immediately closed last month, staff were told they would be paid for shts worked but no more. Edinburgh restaurant manager Janka Jakubekova, , said: “We’re owed up to eight weeks’ money and we’re determined to fight for that. “I was salaried, I had two months’ notice period on my contract but I lost my job in a minute.  “I was taken to Miami and the Bahamas to open a Jamie’s Italian on a cruise ship in February – how can it be possible that just months later it’s in administration  “Watching the administrators put thousands of pounds worth of food in the bin was shocking – all the steak, whole smoked salmons, desserts, fresh vegetables. It was disgusting. My general manager was asked to take the administrators around the store rooms but he told them to go to hell so I had to do it. “Our holding stock in Edinburgh was worth £,. That would have been the same at all the branches.” KPMG said it sent as much of the food as possible to charity. Fellow Edinburgh staff member Kristyna Cunderlova, , said: “I feel really let down by Jamie Oliver personally because this was totally against the ethos of the company that we believed in. “We were told the ethos was that we were a ‘family’. They made each letter of that word stand for a value – the ‘i’ stood for integrity.  “Well, this is not how families treat each other and this is not integrity. Being told you’re out of a job by recorded message half an hour after turning up for work is not integrity. “I worked for three years so I should’ve been due a redundancy payment. There are others who’ve been employed for over five years – people with families and mortgages.” Glasgow staff member Ewan Archibald said: “I’m so angry that, after seven years of toil, blood, sweat and tears, I was dismissed with zero notice. I’ve had no contact from the powers that be who I believe lied to me at meetings.” Edinburgh worker Jeff McDonald added: “Jamie said at our last awards celebration in December that it’s been hard times but, ‘Stick with me for the next eight months and I promise you great things.’ “We were told Jamie’s was generous and would pay us for the days we had worked up until the day we shut but we would not be paid anything  – no redundancy, holiday or notice pay. Yet they happily threw out thousands of pounds’ worth of food from our restaurant.” KPMG said: “Special arrangements were made with Jamie Oliver Holdings to ensure all redundant staff were paid for arrears of pay up to the point of redundancy. “The administrators and their agents contacted charity FareShare to donate the food. “They took everything they were able to from across the estate so the vast majority of perishable food  was donated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"loch ness monster might real","story":"NewsLoch Ness monster might be real as scientists make surprising discoveryScientists collected DNA left by creatures at the loch — and subsequent lab analysis is said to be surprisingShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video footage-shows-mysterious-creature-loch-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA major scientic study of Loch Ness has discovered its famous monster might be real. Researchers travelled theof the loch and took water samples from three dferent depths. The scientists collected DNA left by creatures from their skin, scales, feathers, fur and faeces. Samples were then sent to labs in New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, and France to be analysed. Professor Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago, New Zealand, said the results were “surprising”. He is an expert in genomics, ecology, population, conservation and evolutionary biology.    The professor says he hopes full details of the study’s findings will be released next month. But he hinted that one of four popular theories about Nessie ‘might’ be correct. One is that the monster is a long-necked plesiosaur that survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct. Another more likely explanation is that Nessie is in fact a sturgeon or giant catfish living in the loch. Prof Gemmell said: “Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm.

James Davenport is a man who threw himself into his passions. The former boxer, better known as Shinny, calculated that he slept with , women from the age of  to . Whether it was girlfriends, one night stands or prostitutes, the -year-oldaposs appetite for sex was near intiatbale. But it wasnapost enough.    Alcohol, drugs, sex - anything. The quick, instant gratication was what I wanted, the Salford man said. “From the age of about  or  when I went fully into sex, up until I was about , I calculated that I probably slept with about , women. “I picked up prostitutes, women from clubs, anywhere. I could have between five and  women over the course of a weekend. But it wasn’t enough. “I even started questioning my own sexuality at one point.” Shinnyaposs appetite for sex and alcohol started when he was just ten-years-old. “I would manipulate older girls to perform sex acts on me,” he said. “I was very mature at an early age, my thinking was like a teenager. I knew it was wrong, but it excited me. I couldn’t help myself. “Addicts become experts at manipulating and we will do anything to get what we want. For me it was simple to manipulate a girl older than me and convince her it was OK to do what we were doing.    “The alcoholism started around the same age. I remember drinking alcohol at my grandparents. It was some form of lager in a tap barrel in their spare room. I loved the way it made me feel.” Shinny can pinpoint his compulsive behaviour back to when he was seven and experienced addiction for the first time. “I used to steal it and drink it out of the bottle,” remembered Shinny, who now hosts a recovery talk show in Youtube. “With vinegar, I think I got a kick from it, a bit like with a chilli. “I also remember drinking out of a dirty puddle, and have only recently found out, during my recovery, that it was also part of the addiction. As I drank it I remember thinking - I have made my own decision to do that and no one knows what I’ve done. “Along with that my behaviour was up the wall. I used to wet the bed and was scared of the dark when I was younger. I always felt like an outsider looking in. Through my addictions and behaviour I was trying to escape my own thinking.” By high school Shinny - who also struggled with bulimia for  years - was snfing aerosols, smoking weed and doing harder drugs.    He would go on to sell drugs and become involved with Salford gangs. Sex, drugs, rock and roll, violence and criminal activity was my le,” he said. “Alcoholism has nothing to do with alcohol as such, it’s the feeling that it gives you. Anything that excites me - Iaposm in. “Later on I became involved in criminal activity. I wanted to be the most successful, hardest drug dealer. And the most handsome. I can go to bed thinking about myself, dream about myself and wake up thinking about myself. Addicts are very self-obsessed people.”    Shinny believes some of his issues stemmed from his relationship with his alcoholic father, who wasnapost present during large parts of his upbringing. He had the chance to forgive him for his absence for he died seven years ago. The father of two hit rock bottom when he began planning out his suicide, only to pull himself back from the edge by thinking of his eight and -year-old children. “I planned how I was going to do it, and how. It’s so sad to think that it can get that dark. When my partner left and I could not be with my children anymore, that was what I needed to sort myself out. “I went into detox in . Since then I have had one relapse, but as of June , I will be two years clean.” Despite a relapse in , Shinny has turned his le around with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous’ -step programme, and the support of his partner Nicole Evans. Now two years clean he has used his experience to help educate people about addiction through a documentary called aposThe Making of an Addictapos.   A -minute teaser of the biopic, directed by Chris Green, was screened Saturday morning at HOME and is available to view on Shinnyaposs official Facebook page.He now aims to make the full movie, which he then hopes to take round schools as an education tool for young people. “I want this film to be the new Kes, I want it to be an education to children in schools,” he explained, talking of the  film by Ken Loach. “I have channeled my addictions into getting well and helping others, and want to show others that it can be done. If it wasn’t for my girlfriend Nicole I wouldn’t be where I am today. She’s a massive part of my le. “This disease is always going to be there. You can either wallow in it or fight. My first thought in the morning is always negative, but I quickly change that into a positive and pray to a higher power greater than me to keep me clean and sober for one more day. “It’s a  hour reprieve. I don’t think about tomorrow. If I have to do this for the rest of my le to be a decent father and member of the community, I will.”The trailer of the documentary can be viewed here.If you need someone to talk to Samaritans can be confidentially reached on  .

So I jumped back in a second time and he in fact helped save three of us. Then he walked us back to our van and eventually carried on his jog.

I confess it was a bit of a struggle because I’m the original “you tell the young people of today that, and they won’t believe you” old fart. But hey-ho, there must be some common ground. I ask-year-olds should have the vote but Yasmeen doesn’t think the voting age should be dropped. She says: “I don’t know very much about politics. There are so many stupid people of my age.” And much older, young lady! But is my generation running the country well  Karina thinks not as young people are not represented properly. She argues Swedish school strike leader Greta Thunberg “represents us” and climate change is “more important than Brexit.” As an oldie who thinks the pits should never have been closed and backs fracking under the right conditions, there’s not a lot I can say to that.    These bright sixth-form lasses from Longley Park College in ­Sheffield are also concerned about their generation’s lack of representation on television. Yasmeen says: “They think the decisions are being made by an older generation – not theirs.” Yasmeen’s dad was in the Army but died when she was young, and Karina’s Lithuanian father is not in the country. As the children of migrants, what do they think about the impact of immigration  “I think it’s quite good,” suggests Karina. “We have a lot more cultures now.” Looking back down the wrong end of the telescope, they seem shocked I had to wait until I was  to vote and that  was the second EU referendum, after we voted nearly two to one in  to stay in the then Common Market.    It is disarming to see how young people come fresh to le. They’re both sensitive people, “and with sensitivity comes understanding,” says Karina. And where would they like to be in  years  We’re talking in the busy Daily Mirror newsroom, which appeals to them. Yasmeen says: “I’d like to write about mental health. It’s been neglected.” Pretty soon my half-hour is up, and I ask them to ask me a question. Yasmeen asks: “What political party do you support ” That’s easy. I’m Labour, old Labour in fact, but not a Corbynista. Karina asks what I think about today’s society. That’s harder to answer, but I believe the Thatcherite ­revolution atomised society, exalting ­iniduality over collective identity. Talking across almost  years of experience, it’s not easy to express this without sounding preachy at best and arrogant at worst. But we must try. We can’t expect young people to respect uswe don’t respect them and listen to their views. Schools should give students a chance to hear it from the old nag’s mouth, so to speak.at Mirror BritainTalks "},{"url":null,"title":"students very rude message donald","story":"NewsStudents VERY rude message for Donald Trump on Stansted flightpath ahead of visitThe President of the United States will see the phallic greetinghe looks out of Air Force OneShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video donald-trump-s-what-happened-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe President of the United States will be welcomed to the UK by an enormous penis mowed into a field. Donald Trump will touch down at Stansted to kick off a three day state visit tomorrow morning. If the most powerful man in the world takes the time to look out of the window of Air Force One as heaposs nearing the runway he may get a little surprise. In a field not far from the airport an outline of a penis with the words oi Trump can be clearly seen from above. A separate, nearby field bares the words aposclimate change is realapos beneath a large polar bear.    The message is the inspired work of Bishops Stortford A Level Art student and Upcycling entrepreneur Ollie Nancarrow. “Donald Trump and his denial of climate change are not welcome, he said. “I want him to be fully aware of that when he flies in to Stansted tomorrow.”    Mr Trump has previously shown he is not above a immature penis reference, jovially claiming he is well endowed in a  speech. The climate issue may be more of a sticking point however. In May the UK government declared a climate emergency following two intense weeks of protesting by Extinction Rebellion. While the coalition has been accused of mincing words but not taking action in the month since - Friday seeing the most ever planes flying in UK airspace for example - Mr Trumpaposs unabashed opposition to climate change may rankle.    He has openly mocked renewable energy, promoted the controversial and still highly polluting clean coal industry and decided to pull the USA out of the Paris Climate Accord. It is unlikely flying in his , person entourage along with two identical limousines tomorrow will do much for the Presidentaposs green credentials.

The woman, only identied as Kate, kicked the men out onto the street at am after claiming she felt aposunsafeapos in her home, according to one of the guests, Meshach Cisero. Mr Cisero, who is owner and executive chef of The Cage Bird in Washington D.C, shared a video of her standing over one of the men as he was packing his bag.We arrived to our @Airbnb, and we were harassed several times before being thrown out at  am, Cisero said on Instagram . Her reasonings were because she felt unsafe, we were going to steal and destroy her property, and then told us to “Get the f*** out of her house immediately! We cooperated and began to pack our things to leave. She is also seen in the clip telling them they were not allowed to bring in pets just before a dog is seen running into the shot - however it is not clearthe animal belongs to the men. The clip goes on to show Kate arguing with Mr Cisero about how many the space can accommodate, with the host asserting that it says four.  It says four and a couch, so thataposs five. You have that on your Airbnb description the chef declares.  Kate retorts: Which monkey is going to stay on the couch  prompting the men to yell at her: Your mum. The group start to question whether she actually said that as she quickly turns around and heads downstairs.  Mr Cisero, three friends and his twin brother had checked into the apartment in Manhattanaposs Upper East Side last night shortly before the row erupted. He claimed Kate asked them to leave so they started gathering their things to leave. But he claims that as they were packing, she burst into their room. They asked her to respect their privacy - as one of them had just got out of the shower - but she continued to film, he said.  Cisero added: She became so angry, rude, and disrespectful that we had to call @NYPD because we weren’t sureshe’d attack us while trying to leave. In the video Kate is seen standing over the group telling them they had five minutes to get out and said she would wait for the police here before asking them to come o the first floor. They then apologised for being loud but she replied: After I asked you three times.. It said no pets and no parties. The chef concluded the post stating that the group were able to find a hotel and had somewhere to sleep for the night. Mr Ciseroaposs post on Twitter quickly went viral and Airbnb responded on the thread to share that they were apossorryapos about the incident.An Airbnb spokesperson said: The language used in this video is unacceptable and has no place in the Airbnb community.

We are supporting Mr. Cisero and his friends in getting them a new place to stay through our Open Doors policy. We’re thankful to them for bringing this to our attention so we could take action. Mr Cisero later posted: I am glad that we can shed light on this and hold these people accountable, we can hold our hostaccountable and we can hold Airbnb accountable for these services that they offer us but are not living up to our expectationsapos he said in the video. I am also placing myself in the shoes of what could potentially be someoneaposs little sister or brother, or someone who doesnapost have the means to figure out their situation right away and get out of it.

Trent Innes wonapost hire anyone who fails his aposcoffee cup testapos as he believes itaposs shows more about attitude than any question possibly could. In fact anyone who fails is actually blacklisted from the company. Trent, who works at Xero Australia shared his little trick while speaking on the business podcast The Venture with entrepreneur Lambros Photios. He said: I will always take you for a walk down to one of our kitchens and somehow you always end up walking away with a drink.  Then we take that back, have our interview, and one of the things I’m always looking for at the end of the interview is, does the person doing the interview want to take that empty cup back to the kitchen  You can develop skills, you can gain knowledge and experience but it really does come down to attitude, and the attitude that we talk a lot about is the concept of aposwash your coffee cupapos.  And he claims that this trick works, and the kitchens in their office are always very clean. He goes on: If you come into the office one day inside Xero, you’ll see the kitchens are almost always clean and sparkling and it’s very much off that concept of wash your coffee cup. It’s really just making sure that they’re actually going to fit into the culture inside Xero, and really take on everything that they should be doing.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

That was the purpose of a meeting of farmers, teachers and others interested in the countryside on May .Organised for the Edinburgh-based charity by the local branch of NFU Scotland, -plus people came along to the Inveraray Inn on a bright, chilly May evening.Making the journey west to spread the word were RHET chairman George Lawrie and executive officer Katrina Barclay, who outlined the structure and potential benefits of RHET.With its headquarters at Ingliston, RHET acts as an umbrella body, co-ordinating the existing dozen Countryside Initiatives around Scotland . Each CI is set up as a charity in its own right, with help and support from Ingliston.The point of each regional CI is to bring children closer to farming, forestry, aquaculture and other rural industries.Working with partners, the charity would deliver learning opportunities for young people aged three to  around the Scottish agricultural environment and the countryside.Examples of the activities undertaken by RHET include farm visits for schools classroom speaker talks by volunteer farmers providing free educational resource materials for schools outdoor education events across Scotland competitions and projects for schools and training farmers and teachers in the delivery of information relating to food and farming.Regional CIs are supported by co-ordinators, who will liaise with schools and nurseries, organise visits, carry out health and safety checks and make sure everything is in place for events like farm visits.Present at the meeting was Argyll and Bute Council#s Head of Education Anne Paterson.#I am really encouraged to hear about the work of RHET,# said Mrs Paterson.Emphasising the the importance placed on outdoor education by the local authority, she added: #We have a good history of farm visits in Argyll and Bute, but on a more informal basis. As an education service we encourage schools to be outdoors.Mrs Paterson concluded: #We are really keen to make it happen and to work in partnership with RHET.#George Lawrie, who has been involved with RHET for around  years, said: #What I find most rewarding in working with the young people is just seeing the smiles on their faces.#If you want to find out more, whether as a farmer crofter, education provider or are involved in any other land use or rural industry, contact Lucy Sumsion by email at lucy.sumsion@nfus.org.uk to express an interest.PIC:From left: NFUS Argyll and the Islands region chairnman John Dickson with George Lawrie and Katrina Barclay of Royal Highland Education Trust. _aRHETmeetingKatrina Barclay addresses the sizeable audience in the Inveraray Inn as George Lawrie looks on. _aRHETmeeting"},{"url":null,"title":"fynefest celebrates turning 10 with a beer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFyneFest s for , celebrating hitting double figures with as much flair as ever.Beer, food and music: what more could anyone ask for  And there#s going to be plenty of each at this unique event, held over four days from Friday May .As usual, the field will be filled with trucks serving everything from pizza to curry and cupcakes.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

number from  in   to  in .ldquoThere is considerable overlap between day centres and social centres such as providing transport, meals and social opportunities.ldquoDay centres provide personal care,

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

brother as part of a Preston Athletic Youth FC group that had travelled to the park in Yorkshire for a weekend football tournament.However, as reported in last weekrsquos Courier, the entire group of  people were asked to leave a day early after several incidents involving adults and young players.Flamingo Land took the decision to evict the group after a couplersquos domestic altercation at the bar resulted in security being called and, in a separate incident, police were called to the park to arrest a young woman on suspicion of assault.Sophiersquos dad Michael Carruthers, a coach for the club who splits his time as a part-time support worker and caring for seven-year-old Sophie, from Blawearie Road, Tranent, has now hit out at the ldquodisgusting behaviour of security staff at the park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9932284.jpg?type=article-full","title":"birds-return-to-once-barren-open-cast-coal-mine","story":"The giant open-cast mine at Powharnal in East Ayrshire was so blighted that barely anything would grow at the site after its owner Scottish Coal went bust in .Now, after years of expensive and painstaking work tothe site to nature, birds have ed.This was revealed by the chief executive of Scottish Natural Heritage, Francesca Osowska, as she expressed hope the pit could now become a visitor attraction.Ms Osowska said: \"The open cast mine was left in an incredibly degraded state.

In terms of climate change prevention the answer is peat and trees. Fundamentally, peatland and carbon sequestration really is a key element, as is native planting.\"We talk about green things sucking up the bad stuff, well all trees do that.

Sir Vince Cable has announced he is to stand down.Whoever wins that contest, they will bring in a new style of leadership to take us forward and build on our electoral revival.Our renewed strength in

our power ndash in Parliament and out ndash to prevent him or her from taking us over the clf-edge with a catastrophic no-deal Brexit.The two big parties have been lost to their extremes, and so as the only true social democratic voice left in the UK, we will welcome all those who want to see a political party that fights for whatrsquos best for the country, and not just its own internal interests.And in Scotland, as we look towards the Holyrood elections in , we will continue to be the only pro-EU and pro-UK party.We know that Scotland is better off staying in the UK, and for that UK to remain in the EU.As the SNP Government continues to put the nationalist agenda before the problems in the NHS, our education and transport infrastructure which affect us every day, we will fight

Previously, pupils completing some National s would repeat pretty similar assessments in S for Higher. The time is better spent developing skills and understanding.\"The early signs are promising. Although results at Higher have fluctuated from year to year there has been a signicant overall increase in the proportion of pupils achieving Highers since , when the model was introduced.Nearly  per cent of school-leavers secured at least one Higher this year compared to  per cent six years ago and over the same period pupils achieving five or more Highers has risen from  per cent to  per cent.The schools approach puts an interesting spin on the current debate over whether CfE has led to a restriction in subject choice rather than the greater breadth that was promised.There has been much wringing of hands over a reduction in the number of National  qualications on offer in many schools, but the example of Hillhead demonstrates an approach which does just that, but makes sense for those pupils who will be judged primarily on their Highers.The current debate centres on the fact that under previous curriculum models pupils would routinely sit eight or nine Standard Grades in S before identying the five Highers they would take in S.As CfE was being designed, one of the questions posed was whether cramming for a repetitive cycle of examinations was a worthwhile pursuit. Did it prepare pupils with the skills required for a rapidly changing world and was it something pupils found meaningful, relevant or even enjoyable As a result, the so-called Broad General Educationwas designed for the first three years of secondary school, essentially delaying the start of study for formal qualications from S to S, but allowing pupils to develop a range of additional skills in a less pressured environment.What that has meant in practice for many schools is that pupils only have one year to study the National  and National  qualications that replaced Standard Grade, leading to a reduction in the overall number of subjects.The Scottish Parliaments education committee is currently holding an inquiry into the issue and has received evidence that appears to show a signicantly reduced choice, at least of traditional subjects.Figures from the Reform Scotland think tank show a majority of schools now only offer six subjects in the fourth year of secondary school. Others schools, with a dferent interpretation of the curriculum, are still offering eight or nine, although this usually means choosing subjects earlier than CfE envisaged.Chris Deerin, director of Reform Scotland, said: \"We are in real danger of opening up a new type of attainment gap in Scotland - one where children who are allowed to sit eight or nine National s or s will have a distinct advantage over those restricted to five or six.\"The Royal Society of Edinburgh is also concerned, arguing the impact of reduced subject choice is felt most keenly by learners who leave school at S with fewer qualications than previously might have been the case, typically those from more disadvantaged backgrounds.An RSE paper on subject choice added: \"Reduced course choice at S can also constrain learners options in S and S since it will be more dficult to progress to Higher level without the pre-requisite learning at National  level.\"With English and mathematics seen as essential, the narrowing means particular subjects are now in decline in S. Research by Professor Jim Scott, from Dundee University, identied these as German, French, art, drama, music, computing studies and some sciences.The Scottish Association of Geography Teachers is deeply troubled by the trend saying widespread narrowing of the curriculum has reduced choice for inidual pupils \"thus limiting their career opportunities too soon and restricting the opportunity to change career pathways further into the senior school\".However, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, argues in an interview in the Herald tomorrow that looking at one particular moment in the senior school experience is a mistake because CfE allows pupils to secure qualications and other skills and achievements in a more flexible way.\"Young people are remaining engaged with education and participating in education for longer than was the case when I was at school which is a very signicant change. Wherever I go I dont see a narrowing of choice in Scottish education. I see a blossoming of choice,\" he said.Mr Swinney also said he was relaxed about the dferent curriculum models adopted by schools, with the study of six subjects just as valid as nine, as long as the school had the support of pupils and parents.Nonetheless, curriculum and inspection body Education Scotland has concerns about schools which still have a focus on a traditional qualications structure. And they have gone further than most in suggesting that some subjects may not be relevant to some pupils.Gayle Gorman, Scotlands Chief Inspector of Education, said: \"The aim ... was to change the focus of study in the senior phase from the model that many teachers, parents and others will be familiar with.\"That may well mean young people taking fewer qualications, particularly at some levels ... and that the curriculum design may look dferent from school to school.\"We are still seeing some schools where the focus is on a one year qualications ladder, with a drive to the next batch of National , National , Higher or Advanced Highers, and too often in the traditional subjects that were studied by those of previous generations, but may not always be the best fit now within a st century skillset.\"Young people, preparing for a very dferent world of work than their parents or teachers, are telling us that there is still too much focus being placed on traditional qualications at the expense of more innovative pathways.\"The Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union believes the structures in secondary are mostly unchanged, despite the introduction of CfE.An EIS statement said: \"While the qualications themselves have changed, the ways in which young people undertake them much too closely resemble the experiences of senior students a decade and a half ago.\"Indeed, it could be argued the current arrangement is poorer as the compression of qualications into one year rather than two has required a reduction in the number of subjects chosen and also a signicant time pressure in delivering these courses in a single year.\"Parents are also concerned. Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said they were aware of schools where pupils still chose subjects at the end of second year and began work on their National qualications in third year.She said: \"We are still pushing many youngsters through National  when they could be going straight to Higher. The flexibility of CfE in relation to dferent pathways rather than going through the assessments associated with National  and National  has not been embraced across the board.\"And Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum of Scotland, urged schools to embrace the idea of flexibility.She said: \"More and more of our young people are staying on for the full three years so the focus should be on the qualications that they leave with, not the order in which they sit them.\"There is no point in creating a mental health crisis in our young people, which we hear is happening, by making them just sit and learn things.\"Resolving the tension between specialists who see the quality and longevity of their subjects underpinned by formal qualications in S and beyond and those who argue for less pressure and more alternative choices is not easy.Mark Priestley, professor of education at Stirling University, believes a review of CfE is important to try and establish some fundamental principles about what schools should deliver.He said: \"Fundamentally, we need to consider the worth of qualications. The system as it currently stands tends to encourage an approach which is about passing exams rather than the state of being educated. Both are important, butwe over-focus on qualications then we are selling young people short.\"The controversy about the narrowing of subjects has been largely determined by what people think education should be, based on the way it used to be. At some stage we are going to have to review CfE to determine what schools are actually for.\"*See tomorrows Herald for the full interview with John Swinney."},{"url":null,"title":"d-day-remembered-75-years-later","story":"\"The eyes of the world are upon you,\" he wrote. \"The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.\"It was June , : D-Day.Eisenhowers message, contained in his Order of the Day, was aimed at the vast army of thousands of Allied personnel who were about to undertake the largest amphibious assault ever undertaken, the aim of which was to liberate western Europe from occupying Nazi forces.\"The tide has turned,\" Eisenhower declared. \"The free men of the world are marching together to victory. I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.\"The scale of the invasion, codenamed Operation Overlord, remains staggering.In the words of author Antony Beevor in his bestselling account, D-Day: \"In one night and day, , fighting men and their equipment, including , vehicles of all types, ranging from motorcycles to tanks and armoured bulldozers, were transported across sixty to a hundred miles of open water and landed on a hostile shore against intense opposition. They were either carried by or supported on,\" Beevor adds, \", ships and craft of all types and almost , airplanes.\"A stupendous amount of planning had gone into the operation. Absolutely nothing had been left to chance.Remarkable efforts had been made to deceive Hitler as to the precise location of the invasion. The Allies needed him to think that the target was Pas de Calais rather than  miles away in Normandy, so that he would keep half a million of his troops in Pas de Calais.Fortitude North, one part of the deception operation, Plan Fortitude, revolved around a fake Fourth British Army based in Scotland that was preparing to invade Norway, so as to keep German isions tied up in that country.The Allies desperately needed Overlord to succeed. As Max Hastings writes in All Hell Let Loose, his account of the Second World War -it had failed, civilian morale would have plummeted on both sides of the Atlantic, senior commanders would have had to be replaced, and the western Allies prestige would have suffered grievously.The invasion began late before dawn on June , when US and British airborne isions dropped into occupied Normandy to secure the flanks of the assault zone.A fierce naval bombardment softened up German coastal defences, prior to thousands of soldiers being taken in on landing craft and storming five beaches, codenamed Sword, Juno, Gold, Omaha and Utah. British and Canadian forces took the first three, US forces the other two.Figures y as to the number of Allied dead on D-Day, but one recent statistic, quoted by historian Andrew Roberts, says , Allied soldiers were killed that day, including , American, , British,  Canadian.ldquoEvery Scottish Regiment was represented in the D-Day Operation Overlord in some shape or form,\" comments Legion Scotland - the Royal British Legion Scotland. \"Some of the Battalions taking heavy losses in the east, wiping out full battalions, with their numbers then being passed on to fellow battalions to hold on to their number - i.e. nd battalion being wiped out, the th battalion back home became the  th battalion.\"The th Infantry Division on D-Day consisted of infantry brigades made up of Scottish regiments, including battalions from the Royal Scots, Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Argyll and Sutherlands, Royal Scots Fusiliers, Cameronians , Glasgow Highlanders, Seaforth Highlanders, Scots Guards and the Coldstream Guards.A vivid first-hand account was given in  by broadcaster Sir Huw Wheldon, who had become Managing Director of BBC TV.In  he was a major with the Royal Ulster Rles, and on June  he landed in a glider in a Normandy field, part of the ,-strong British th airborne ision.Standing in the same field  years later for a BBC documentary, Destination D-Day, Wheldon told the camera: \"On our right, coming off the beaches, were British and Canadians, for about  miles. Beyond them, Americans for another  miles, and beyond them, American airborne isions, doing the same job as we were doing, on the right flank. So we constituted the left of the bridgehead.\"I dont really remember my feelings from that day. It was a long time ago. There was, no doubt, a feeling of relief that you always have, when you get down on dry ground and have the smell of grass and the feel of solid earth under your feet.\" I think I remember a feeling of elation. We had come over in waves during the day, Some of our people had started very early, in the small hours before the seaborne troops came in, and the rest of us came over the day in these waves, and accordingly, by the time we came, we were able to see the ships standing off the coast.\"We were able to see the great capital ships blazing and blasting into inland targets. We were able to see people on the beaches. And there were aircraft all over the place. A great comfort they were, too - , sorties were flown during that  hours.\"He added: \"What I am absolutely certain I remember, and Im in no doubt about, was that there was a very, very definite sense of everything going according to plan.\"By the end of the day, the Allied forces had established a bridgehead, but the hard work was only just beginning.\"The importance of D-Day often overshadows the overall signicance of the entire Normandy campaign,\" says the Imperial War Museum. \"Establishing a bridgehead was critical, but it was just the first step. In the three months after D-Day, the Allies launched a series of additional offensives to try and advance further inland. These operations ied in success and the Allies faced strong and determined German resistance.\"The bocage - a peculiarity of the Normandy landscape characterised by sunken lanes bordered by high, thick hedgerows - was dficult to penetrate and placed the advantage with the German defenders. Yet the bloody and protracted Battle of Normandy was a decisive victory for the Allies and paved the way for the liberation of much of north-west Europe.Writes Beevor: \"British, Canadian and American armies all shared one belief. To reduce their own losses, they would always rely on a massive artillery bombardment, and on several occasions heavy aerial bombing. The battle for Normandy led to the deaths of , French civilians and the serious wounding of probably , more.\"... All one can say, as French historians have been the first to recognize, is that the martyrdom of Normandy at least spared the rest of France from similar destruction.\"Many events are being held in Normandy and this country to commemorate the th anniversary of that momentous day.THE events of D-Day have been recalled in countless books, films and TV dramas.* Steven Spielbergs Oscar-winning  film, Saving Private Ryan, recreated, to gruelling and bloody effect in its opening sequence, the US landing on Omaha beach.* The TV mini-series Band of Brothers follows Easy Company, th regiment of the st Airborne Division, as it parachutes into Normandy on June . The series follows the company until the end of the war, in .* The Longest Dayis a classic D-Day film, shot in at least a couple of the real locations used on D-Day.* More recently, Brian Cox starred in Churchill , in the days before the invasion of Normandy.New books on the subject include Sand  Steel, by Peter Caddick-Adams Normandy , by James Holland and D-Day, The British Beach Landings, by John Sadler.A LIVING HISTORY re-enactor will take centre-stage at Fort George, a Historic Environment Scotlandproperty near Ardersier, Inverness, on Wednesday and Thursdayto explain the role it played in the preparations for the D-Day.Fort George and the Moray Firth were used as landing training for the top-secret D-Day preparations. Battalions and regiments were stationed there in rotation before moving to other training locations around Scotlandand the UK.General Montgomeryvisited on February , , to watch the preparations. A parade was held at or near Fort George with over  troops.The HES learning resource says: ldquoFrom  Fort George played a signicant role in rehearsals for the D-Day landings that took place in the Moray Firth. Concrete replicas of the German gun emplacements of the Atlantic Wall were constructed and destroyed landing craft were tested on the beaches between Fort George and Nairn.ONE of the most famous images of D-Day concerns piper Bill Millin, who played his pipes as he followed Brigadier Lord Lovat, Commander st Commando Brigade, onto Sword beach. Millin was Lovats personal piper. \"Give us a tune, piper,\" Lovat said.Writing in our sister paper, the Evening Times,  years after D-Day, Millin said: \"I blew up my pipes and played [the Commandos] ashore to Highland Laddiersquo amid bursting mortar shells. Lord Lovat then ordered me to march up and down the beach playing The Road to the Isles while the rest of the brigade assembled in bombed-out houses just off the beach. I donrsquot think anyone was paying particular attention to my efforts!As was the custom, Millin wore nothing under his kilt. He once told author Peter Caddick-Adams that the coldness of the water played havoc with his anatomy, while his kilt floated around him like a tartan jellyfish.IN order to bring essential supplies into Normandy after the invasion, two colossal Mulberry harbours were constructed in pieces in England and towed to Normandy, where they were put together. \"IKEA on an epic scale ... one of the great Allied successes of D-Day,\" writes author John Sadler.

Within days, MSPs Neil Findlay and Daniel Johnson quit the shadow cabinet. Scottish Labour is on le-support.In an interview with the Herald on Sunday, Leonard, the partyrsquos first left-wing leader, reflected on Scottish Labourrsquos worst ever result, spoke candidly about the mistakes that were made during the campaign, and insisted he is staying on.ldquoI am absolutely clear that I have got no intention of stepping down. I am going to lead the Scottish Labour party into the elections of , he says, in a meeting room in the partyrsquos Glasgow headquarters.: Richard Leonard in row over plan which could cull Labour MSPsLeonard was quick to accept last week that his partyrsquos European election strategy had failed. Even though Scotland voted Remain in the Brexit referendum, Leonard had echoed Jeremy Corbynrsquos lsquosoft Brexitrsquo message that was designed to appeal to both sides in the EU debate. He succeeded only in haemorrhaging votes to the SNP and the Lib Dems.Post-drubbing, he has changed his mind and positioned his party as being unequivocally pro-Remain. He also says he will campaign around Scotland for the UK to stay in the EU.However, it is important to understand some of the root causes of why his European campaign bombed. The SNPrsquos election communication included a picture of Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish Tories put Ruth Davidson front and centre of their literature. Scottish Labourrsquos main leaflet, by contrast, had a picture of Corbyn. Leonard was nowhere to be seen.ldquoIrsquove had conversations with Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, and we both agree that that was a mistake, because his picture wasnrsquot on the leaflet in Wales either, he says.Given that one of Leonardrsquos main problems is a low profile, such a decision by the UK party seems unforgivable. But it could have been even worse.ldquoThe leaflet that you describe originally had a text which didnrsquot recognise that wersquove got dferent challenges facing public services in Scotland. And so we had to re-write the text, Leonard says.Revealed: SNP ministers former staff received thousands in secret exit paymentsI put it to him that the picture decision was made by Corbynrsquos office, with the finger of suspicion being pointed at communications director Seamus Milne.ldquoI wasnrsquot involved in the negotiations about that, he says, weakly.This reply sums up the last twenty years of Scottish Labour. If Leonard is the leader of an autonomous party, he should not have to ldquonegotiate to have his face on his own partyrsquos leaflet. Little wonder critics hurl the branch office jibe at him.ldquoI accept that, as much as possible, the election should have been used as a  to promote me, he says.Leonard and Corbyn are political allies, but the Scottish Labour leaderrsquos colleagues believe the pair are too close. Colin Smyth, a member of Leonardrsquos shadow cabinet, said last week that he had to become his ldquoown man. Is Smyth correct ldquoI donrsquot accept this narrative that I am simply there as Jeremy Corbynrsquos man in Scotland, he says. ldquoI accept that I need to present myself, and make it absolutely clear, that there is a distinctive Scottish Labour party position on things.He also believes that Scottish Labour may need more autonomy: ldquoThere is still work that needs to be done, some battles that need to be re-fought, to establish the importance of having a distinctive Scottish Labour presentation to the people of Scotland.An area of potential reform is party discipline. One racism case relating to a Scottish member has dragged on for over eighteen months, but the investigation is handled at a UK level. Leonard is sympathetic to this changing:ldquoThere has been a debate about whether the current disciplinary process inside the Labour party...is fit for purpose. And I think that there is a case to be examined around that.:SNP councillor raises questions about partys poundk indyref fundraiserHowever, Leonardrsquos dficulties as leader did not start with the European election campaign. After he defeated moderate MSP Anas Sarwar to succeed Kezia Dugdale in , his allies believe he has been undermined by a relentless series of briefings, leaks and sniping.ldquoOf course I get frustrated when things are leaked, but in the end wersquove got to try and focus as a party, not on ourselves, but on all those people, in all those communities, that need a Labour Government, he says.ldquoThe Scottish Labour party will only succeed when we are outward looking and when we talk about the things that are important to the people we need to appeal to.Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, a leading Corbyn critic, recently wrote on WhatsApp that Scottish Labour is full of ldquothugs and incompetents. It was then leaked. What did Leonard think of these comments ldquoFirst of all, I dismiss the allegation. And, secondly, I just donrsquot think it is constructive or helpful.He also points out that Murray is a member of Labourrsquos governing Scottish Executive committee :ldquoHe is part of the leadership of the Scottish Labour party. If hersquos got views, he should express them, but he should express them in a more measured way.Sarwar, who Leonard sacked from his shadow cabinet last year, also piped up with an analysis of the partyrsquos woes last week. The Glasgow MSP said the leadership ldquomust decide whether they speak for a clique or faction, or ldquowhether they speak for all of our party.Leonard does not appear impressed with his colleaguersquos comments: ldquoI donrsquot recognise the description that the Scottish Labour party is some kind of clique. We are a party which embraces all the traditions of the Labour movement.I askhe believes Sarwar was loyal to him when he served in the shadow cabinet:ldquoHe was somebody who, I think, performed well in the Parliament, but when the year was up I decided to review the shadow cabinet and had a reshuffle. That is code for no.Picture: Leonard and SarwarCuriously, however, he seems to talk about the devolution of extra powers in the context of a post-Brexit UK, which since last week is an outcome he says he is opposing:ldquoIf Brexit were to happen, then areas of decision-making that currently rest with a Commission in Brussels, a European Parliament that convenes in plenary session in Strasbourg, thatrsquos subject to, in the end, decision-making by a Council of Ministers, and is overseen by a European Court of Justicehellip. we withdraw from the European Union we will no longer be part of these institutions.

A majority of his MSPs voted for Sarwar and group meetings are said to be brutal. Some of Leonardrsquos allies want the partyrsquos SEC, which has a left wing majority, to hand pick some of the candidates. Such a move could lead to a cull of serving MSPs and a civil war.Would he be in favour of the SEC being able to rank some of the candidates, rather than members  ldquoThat will be up to the SEC, comes the reply.I repeat the question and he again defers to the SEC. He is clearly thinking about it. ldquoIn each dferent Scottish Parliament election, from  onwards, there has been a dferent system employed for selecting people for the List. So we shall see, he says. I half expect him to wink at me at this point.Leonard, perhaps improbably for a man who has just led his party to fth place, is focused on coming first at the next Holyrood election. He has a dig at predecessors who have racked up a tally of defeats.ldquoOne of my criticisms of the Scottish Labour party in times past has been that our ambition was simply to be a strong opposition. If we donrsquot believe in ourselves, why should we expect anybody  to believe in us and vote for us He adds: ldquoThere is no reason why Scottish Labour canrsquot win those elections in , because we will be offering the most radical programme of economic, social and environmental change in the history of devolution.His problem will be convincing the voters. Some Labour policies are undoubtedly popular, but the same judgement cannot be made of his party.ldquoPeople may have lost their faith, or seen their faith diminished, in the Labour party, he concedes. ldquoBut I donrsquot think their faith has diminished in the values of the Labour party.

While the tank manrsquos identity and fate remain a mystery, the world now knows much more about what happened during those days when more than a million Chinese civilians, many of them students, staged the biggest challenge to the Communist Partyrsquos legitimacy since it had come to power in .Initially fuelled by anger at the slow place of democratic reforms by a government many viewed as a dictatorship, the main demands of the protestors were for an end to corruption in official circles along with the special privileges of the elite, freedom of expression in society and in the media.As the pro-democracy movement rapidly spread across this vast country, attempts at compromise by the two sides failed. After about two months, martial law was declared in parts of Beijing and , troops sent to quell what the Chinese Communist Party called a ldquocounter-revolutionary revolt and bring the capital under control.ldquoWhite terror, a term that originated from the Russian civil war, was the phrase people used to describe the expanding security crackdown. This was to culminate in those moments when the Chinese lsquoPeoplersquos Liberation Armyrsquo opened fire point-blank on unarmed civilians around Tiananmen Square.Like the identity of the ldquotank man himself, just exactly how many died remains something of a mystery. Some western press agencies reported on June   that the Chinese government first said there were  deaths. Another figure from the Chinese Red Cross estimated , people were killed, but that figure was later retracted.Also on June , the very day the lsquotank manrsquo photograph was taken, a diplomatic cable sent by the-then British ambassador to China and declassied in , estimated at least , were killed.Whatever the true figure, over the past three decades since, the ruling Communist Party has systematically attempted to erase the numbers and memory of Tiananmen using both high-and low-tech methods including extensive online censorship, and brute intimidation of dissidents and victims families.The Tiananmen crackdown is a taboo subject in China and never more so than in the run up to its anniversary. This year itrsquos business as usual in Beijing as far as the clampdown is concerned say human rights groups.ldquoThirty years on from the Tiananmen bloodshed the very least the victims and their families deserve is justice, observed Roseann Re, East Asia Research Director of Amnesty International last week.ldquoPresident Xi continues to read from the same tired political playbook, cruelly persecuting those seeking the truth about the tragedy in a concerted effort to wipe the crackdown from memory, Re added, referring to Chinarsquos current leader President Xi Jinping.As Amnesty and other human rights organisations have highlighted, any references to those dark days in Tiananmen continues to be systematically censored in China.In fact anyone who seeks to commemorate the victims does so at great personal risk and is likely to be harassed or detained.As Chinarsquos most sensitive day of the year approaches, the Orwellian big brother surveillance machine that the regime uses to monitor and watch itrsquos citizens has gone into full deployment.Censors at Chinese internet companies say tools to detect and block content related to the  crackdown have reached unprecedented levels of accuracy, aided by machine learning and voice and image recognition.ldquoWe sometimes say that the articial intelligence is a scalpel, and a human is a machete, said one content screening employee at Beijing Bytedance Co Ltd, who spoke last week to the Reuters news agency but asked not to be identied because they are not authorised to speak to media.Two employees at the firm said censorship of the Tiananmen crackdown, along with other highly sensitive issues including Taiwan and Tibet, is now largely automated.Posts that allude to dates, images and names associated with the protests are automatically rejected.ldquoWhen I first began this kind of work four years ago there was opportunity to remove the images of Tiananmen, but now the articial intelligence is very accurate, one of the employees told Reuters.More than , words that reference the Tiananmen massacre have been censored, according to a joint survey released this year by the University of Toronto and the University of Hong Kong.Perhaps not coincidentally, Chinese live video streaming sites too have announced they would be ldquoupdating their systems over the next few days, preventing users from creating new accounts or posting comments in real time.This has not prevented some people from playing a sort of online cat and mouse game with the authorities. On June th itself more and more obscure references will be made on social media sites, with obvious allusions blocked immediately. In some years during the anniversary even the word ldquotoday has been erased.In the lead-up to this yearrsquos anniversary, censorship on social media has targeted LGBT groups, labour and environment activists and non-governmental groups , say human rights activists.On Friday, the New York-based Human Rights Watchpublished a list of names associated with the pro-democracy protests of . Some of the people on the list have already been jailed, recently placed under house arrest or forced to go on ldquovacation far from Beijing.On May  several artists in Nanjing on a ldquonational conscience exhibit tour went missing and are feared to have been detained, according to Liu Lijiao, the we of one artist, Zhui Hun.According to rights groups, Chinese authorities also recently took well-known activist Hu Jia on an enforced ldquoguarded vacation to a port city nearly  miles from his Beijing home.The HRW published list also includes a non-governmental group, called the Tiananmen Mothers, made up of relatives of people killed back during the protests.The ldquomothers live under constant electronic and police surveillance. Police are known to pounce on any attempt by them to hold group-mourning sessions for their children killed that day back in .Two weeks ago founding member of the group, -year-old Ding Zilin, whose son was killed by troops, was forced to travel more than  miles to her hometown in Jiangsu province.With many of the ldquomothers now very elderly, they fear they will not live to see Beijing reverse its official condemnation of the protests as a ldquocounter-revolutionary riot. For now they can only invest their hopes in the judgment of history.In a recent open letter signed on the website of ldquoHuman Rights in China,  relatives of those killed in the massacre remember  of their number who have died in recent years.ldquoThirty years later, while the criminal evidence has been covered up by the faccedilade of lsquoprosperityrsquo made up of towering buildings and clustered overpasses, the hard facts of the massacre are etched into history. No one can erase it no power, however mighty, can alter it and no words or tongues, however clever, can deny it, they wrote in the open letter.But itrsquos not only during the Tiananmen anniversary however that Chinarsquos human rights abuses are brought to the fore and revealed.Rights activists point to how the government continues to draft and enact new laws under the guise of ldquonational security that present serious threats to human rights. Two years ago the writer, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo died in custody.Many others meanwhile continue to be detained, prosecuted and sentenced on the basis of vague and over-broad charges such as ldquosubverting state power, ldquopicking quarrels and provoking trouble.Police are also known to detain human rights defenders outside formal detention facilities, sometimes incommunicado, for long periods, which pose the additional risk of torture and other ill treatment to the detainees.Repression of religious activities outside state-sanctioned churches has similarly increased, likewise crackdowns conducted under so called ldquoanti-separatism or ldquocounter-terrorism laws these being particularly severe in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and Tibetan-populated areas.In what human rights groups have called the largest mass incarceration of the st century more than one million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims are believed held in internment camps.In the name of \"fighting terrorism\" China has turned the whole of Xinjiang province where Uighurs make up the largest group in the region into a gigantic police state. Surveillance cameras are everywhere, at the entrance to schools, supermarkets and train stations. The police and army patrol the whole territory while searches and identity checks are systematic.The reverberations from the Tiananmen protest have helped shape todayrsquos China into a security state in which staging such a demonstration would be nearly impossible. This is a state like no other in terms of the scale of its system of mass surveillance and use of high-tech advancements like facial recognition to keep an eye on civilians.The government is even experimenting with a ldquosocial credit ldquo system that assigns scores to civilians based on their behaviour and can affect their ability to buy a plane ticket or borrow money.Faced with all this, for many Chinese Tiananmen remains a kind of watershed in terms of the countryrsquos human rights.ldquoTiananmen actually ides the history of the Peoplersquos Republic of China into before and after, observed Bao Pu, the son of one Tiananmen activist interviewed last week by the Financial Times.Today his father Bao Tong, now  years old is still under -hour surveillance at his home in Beijing because of his role in the Tiananmen events.ldquoWhat was before was that people still trusted the Communist party. They never imagined the party would send in the troops and tanks and shoot them. But after that event, the trust has been broken, Bao Pu added, when asked about the legacy of Tiananmen.For many people Tiananmen and the China of today seem worlds apart. It remains dficult to imagine back then there was such as thing as the Goddess of Democracy and Freedom, a  foot-tall statue constructed by protestors in only four days out of foam and papier-mache over a metal armature.Itrsquos dficult also to imagine those young students camped out in the square megaphones in hand proclaiming the need for political reform.The China of today is such a very dferent place with its futuristic skyscrapers and millions of new cars jostling for position on clogged and polluted city streets that are under constant surveillance by the countryrsquos ruling communist authorities.But despite such changes, Tiananmen continues to haunt and embolden even as the regime tries to erase it from memory.The identity and fate of the ldquotank man, might still remain a mystery. His presence however and what he represented, lingers on like some ghostly inspirational apparition in the collective mindrsquos eye of many."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-snp-ministers-former-staff-received-thousands-in-secret-exit-payments","story":"Several ex-employees for Ash Denham, Minister for Community Safety, have received pay-offs with some signing gagging clauses after leaving her employ.The revelations have prompted calls for greater transparency over settlement agreements which come from the public purse.Denham, MSP for Edinburgh Eastern, has recently settled a dispute with one former employee who complained that she had breached confidentiality by passing on personal details.Christine Jardine: The future looks bright for our partyThe MSPrsquos former employee resigned and started official proceedings after discovering an email detailing their personal health problems had allegedly been sent to a fellow SNP MSP.It is understood the dispute has been settled with any potential tribunal proceedings now being dropped.In  and , the National Union of Journalists trade union represented other employees of Denham who had complained about their treatment.One staff member was given a pound, compensation payment as part of a settlement agreement, which included a non-disclosure clause, after complaining they had been discriminated against on the grounds of disability, and in another case an employee was given more than pound, as a lsquogood will paymentrsquo when they quit their post.They cited victimisation and bullying from within the MSPrsquos office - not by the MSP - as part of their reason for leaving and said their job was no longer tenable.One SNP source told the Herald on Sunday: ldquoShe [Ash] needs to control what is going on in her office.ldquoThere is also a question to be asked about where this information is recorded and how easily available it is to the public, to be able to see what their money is being spent on. Itrsquos not clear that these practices happen, and who is doing this.:Lib Dems call for freedom of information legislation to be expandedIn , the Scottish Parliament removed the non-disclosure clause from its standard settlement agreement. It does not rule out the use of such agreements, with gagging clauses still able to be usedboth parties agree to it.The settlement agreements used by Denham for two of the cases contained non-disclosure clauses within them.According to official figures, MSPs offered their staff settlement agreements  times between February  and February .The total amount paid out was pound,. with parliament officials stating none of the cases related to bullying or harassment.A spokesman said such payments would typically come from MSP staff cost allowances, currently capped at pound,.An SNP spokesman said: \"We do not comment on employment matters. MSPs, in common with all employers, are able to let staff go in line with HR advice, guidance and legal requirements where their employment is no longer required.\"A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: ldquoSettlement agreements are a legitimate means of facilitating the ending of an employment relationship on mutually agreed terms and do not affect former employeesrsquo right to make a protected disclosure such as whistleblowing.Some politicians have raised concerns about the use of non-disclosure agreements by elected officials.Labour peer Lord Foulkes said: ldquoThis is certainly not transparent. I have a number of concerns about NDAs and the way they are used to gag people.ldquoI am surprised they would be used by any elected member.:Richard Leonard in row over plan which could cull Labour MSPsA Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ldquoWith the allegations against Joanna Cherry still unresolved, this is a really bad look for the SNP.ldquoI wonder how quickly Nicola Sturgeon will describe Ash Denham as an lsquoassetrsquo to the SNP government Traditionally NDAs have been used by corporations to prevent those employees leaving the business from disclosing confidential information or trade secrets, which could hinder their former companiesthey move to new job.The controversial element comes from when they are used to settle employment disputes. If a member of staff claims they have been wrongfully dismissed or discriminated against, employers have been found to settle the disputes to avoid any negative publicity, by paying staff and asking them to sign a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement.By signing the agreement, employees are effectively legally bound not to repeat or discuss any of the allegations again in public, leading to the agreements being commonly described as gagging clauses.The use of non-disclosure agreements and clauses specically in discrimination cases, is currently under review in Westminster, with hundreds of submissions received in the past six months.It comes following revelations that employees of businessman Sir Phillip Greene signed NDAs when they accused him of sexual and racial discrimination.The Topshop tycoon was accused of making racist comments to black employees, groping female staff, and of being aggressive towards both male and female workers - all of which he denies.Westminsters Women and Equalities committee have heard evidence from business leaders, human rights campaigners and lawyers about their views on the use of NDAs in discrimination cases.Scottish employment law firm Thompsons solicitors were among those which submitted evidence.In its submission in November, the firm states thatthe clauses were banned altogether \"this would ensure that the true extent of sexual harassment and discrimination claims within the workplace was much more widely known.\"\"In addition, it would prevent serial offenders within a workplace having their conduct so easily ldquohushed up by their employer.\"Surely,there were several employees who all had their sexual harassment claims settled, in circumstances where the employees could discuss what happened to them, questions would need to be answered by senior managers in regards to what action,any, they were taking to address the perpetratorrsquos conduct.In addition, we believe thatwomen were able to speak about what happened to them in the workplace it is more likely that other women who have suffered similar acts of harassment or discrimination may come forward due to having a collective voice and therefore there being more likelihood that they would be believed.\"The flip side of banning NDAs is that it may prevent employers from settling employment claims. A confidentiality clause can have huge value for an employer whose reputation means a lot to them, their customers and their business. Therefore,NDAs were not permitted, an employer may be more likely to run sexual harassment cases to Tribunal in order to seek to prove that the harassment didnrsquot take place.\"The firm suggested that one way of controlling their use would be to force companies to publish how many they use in any given year, similar to the practice of publishing annual figures on the gender pay.SNP MP Hannah Bardell has also spoken previously about having to sign an NDA before becoming an elected politician, and welcomed the suggestion by the solicitors firm.She added: \"I think thats a very good idea. I dont knowit would work in the public sector or in politics, but certainly for the private sector I think it is a good idea.\"In my own experience having been through it myself in the private sector, I signed one because I felt pressured and I havent had another option.\"The reality is there are legitimate uses and illegitimate uses, and getting into the complexity of that is very dficult. Good employment practised for members and for staff, and support for staff and members is absolutely vital.\"They are all things that, whatever parliament we are in need to be constantly reviewed and addressed to make sure that everybody gets adequate support of there are any employment issues.\" Having looked into technical points of NDAs it is clear there are helpful uses but they are massively open to abuse as well, and I can only speak from a business perspective on that, from my own experience.\"Finding a way to stop the misuse is very challenging and I dont think anyone has been able to answer that question yet.\""},{"url":null,"title":"plotting-the-new-world-order-the-man-from-the-cia-stravaiging-with-rory-and-getting-dizzy-with-bojo","story":"The annual meeting of the worldrsquos secret government concludes later today.

The only year a meeting hasnt been held since was , when it was cancelled as Bernhard was embroiled in a scandal over accusations that he took a bribe from US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed. He did. It was  million.Participants at the meeting are barred from revealing who said what during it and the group does not release any notes or summaries of discussions. Journalists are not allowed to report on the event, though some attend as participants. The organisers claim this isnrsquot about secrecy but privacy so that participants can speak freely. Among those who have taken part in the past are crowned heads of state, presidents and prime ministers, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown among them.Future president Bill Clinton attended and this year the Trump administration is represented by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and The Donaldrsquos son-in-law Jared Kushner.

My old chum George Galloway was peacefully asleep in bed with his we Gayatri in a posh hotel in Almaty, after a verbal bout with Steve Bannon at a conference there. In the early hours they were wakened by someone trying to get into the room, the efforts growing exceedingly noisy and forceful so much so that the door began to give as a shoulder was put to it. The couple stacked furniture behind the door and called security, George hurling threats of Dundee vengeancethe man ndash he could tell it was a man because he could see a bald head through the doorrsquos spy hole ndash did not cease and desist. When help arrived and grabbed the guy, Galloway opened the door and recognised the would-be intruder, or assassin.

Hersquos all over social media as he stravaigs the country collaring poor dupes on cameraand telling them how hersquod solve Brexit, which is essentially to re-present the failed May plan, with added,unexplained, legerdemain. People are locking their doors, refusing to walk the dog or go to the pub or the book group, for fear that Rory will lurch out of the dark with an iPhone, grab them and subject them to an on-camera selfie about his boundless merits, or his exploits sleeping on dirt floors and nursing blisters in the Hindu Kush.Rory has done a lot of walking in the past. The Borders, the Middle East, he was one of our apparatchiks in Iraq after the invasion but now thinks it was wrong. Hersquos Scottish in the way that anyone who went to Eton and enjoys a family estate in Perthshire is. His late father Brian was a senior official in the intelligence services and Rory does not deny that he was once on the books of MI.

Hersquos such a full-on British patriot is Rory that he even inhales the poppy.Dizzy with the factsldquoThere are three kinds of lies ndash lies, damned lies and statistics. The phrase was attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, although he almost certainly wasnrsquot the original source. Disraeli is also credited with fathering one-nation conservatism, for electoral and ethical reasons. Which takes us, with one massive historical jump, to Boris Johnson who knows much about bending facts for electoral means but who has scant acquaintance with the second of Dizzyrsquos imperatives.Boris is due to appear in court to answer the charge that hersquos guilty of misconduct in public office when, as London mayor on the Leave beat, he claimed Britain was paying pound million a week to the European Union. Leaving aside whether such a spurious claim should be tested in law ndash and it shouldnrsquot, or the courts would be clogged with politicians tasked over truthfulness ndash therersquos no doubt it had considerable traction in the campaign.And traction was unveiled three years ago this month when BoJo launched the Vote Leave battlebus ndash on whose side the poundm a week was plastered ndash and railed against the EU for ldquotelling us how powerful our vacuum cleaners have got to be, what shape our bananas have got to be and all that kind of thing.Itrsquos true that vacuum cleaners use less electricity than they did, but the manufacturers were consulted and backed the new rules, as did the UK Government which actively supported the measures and, like every member state, could have blocked themit wanted to. The Brussels ban on bendy bananas, propagated by the Sun and , is one of the most persistent myths and is, of course, a nonsense.An alleged ban on prawn cocktail crisps has inflamed Boris for almost  years now and on the Brexit stump he cited theldquogreat war against the British prawn cocktail flavour crisp as part of his evidence of Brussels gone doolally. Except the EU has never banned the crisps. The UK failed to include the flavour when the EU was drafting a harmonised list but when the mistake was noticed by Westminster the list was immediately amended.Among the other EU myths that Boris hasnrsquot yet got around to are, that barmaids cleavage had to be covered. In fact the directive was about outdoor workers who shouldnrsquot suffer over-exposure to the sun and risk skin cancer. Which caused the newspaper of the same name, in its usual tasteful way, to tell readers to ldquolt your jugs to the Sun for saving Britainrsquos barmaids.Itrsquos also not true that the EU wanted to ban double-decker buses ndash oddly BoJo didnrsquot throw that one in when he launched the battlebus ndash or that there would be a one-size-fits-all Euro condom. And fortunately we wonrsquot be called on to order a Melanogrammus aeglefinus in the chippie, because it was never an EU plan to force restaurants and takeaways to list fish, like the haddock, by their Latin names.Expect more of this as the Tory election campaign cranks up."},{"url":null,"title":"sam-gyimah-becomes-13th-mp-to-enter-tory-leadership-race","story":"The Remain supporter announced his intention to run on Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge On Sunday, telling the programme he wanted to ldquobroaden the race.He said: ldquoI will be joining the contest to be the next Conservative leader and prime minister to broaden the race.ldquoThere is a wide range of candidates out there but there is a very narrow set of views on Brexit being discussed..@SamGyimah tells #Ridge that he wants the public to have a \"final say on the #Brexit deal\" and that its the only way to break \"deadlock\" in parliament.He says hes the only Tory leadership candidate supporting another referendum.Latest here: https:t.co yOIicYEBPZ pic JlTNjsdOgmdash Ridge on SundayJune , ldquoAnd over the last few weeks I have watched on discussing with colleagues in frustration that while therersquos a broad sweep of opinion in the country on how we move forward at this critical time that is not being reflected in the contest at the moment.Mr Gyimah, the MP for East Surrey, quit the Government at the end of last year over Mrs Mayrsquos Brexit plan, and has since become a vocal advocate for a second referendum.ldquoWhat most of the candidates are offering is to offer no-deal and a fudge on Theresa Mayrsquos deal which has been heavily defeated.ldquoParliament is deadlocked, we all know that, we want to move forward, and we want to be able to bring the country together and so that is why I think a final say on the Brexit deal is the way to achieve that and for the Conservative Party I think what we need to be doing is putting the country first.He insisted he was not positioning himself for a cabinet post and said he would find it ldquovery dficult to serve as a minister under a leader pursuing a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"susan-boyle-returns-to-britains-got-talent","story":"But her performance with Michael Ball ided viewers.Ten years have passed since the -year-old, from Bathgate, West Lothian, won hearts around the world with her rendition of I Dreamed A Dream from Les Miserables and has released her latest album, TEN, to mark the anniversary of her memorable appearance.During the BGT final at Hammersmith Apollo in London, she sang A Million Dreams with veteran Mr Ball, but their performance of the track from the hit movie The Greatest Showman didnrsquot impress all.Viewers were ided online, with some saying the song didnrsquot come over well.One viewer Tweeted Mr Ball, saying: ldquoWell cheers you just spoilt that .

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Families have told of their experiences on Universal Credit\"  Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even furtherviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Tesco colleagues will be showcasing the Community Food Connection scheme this weekend\"  Inverurie store celebrates four years of surplus food donations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"charity dog walk to be held at haddo","story":"Employees of Nicol of Skene will be hosting a charity dog walk at Haddo Country Park in July.The event will be held on Sunday, July  at .am.The idea for the event was created through the love for dogs Nicol of Skene employees have and, their partnership with the cancer care charity, Friends of ANCHOR.The charity is one very close to many at Nicol of Skene.Richard Stott, Managing Director at Nicol of Skene, said: “Friends of ANCHOR are a very important charity in the North East of Scotland and unfortunately, many lives have been affected by cancer, our staff included. “The dog walk is a fantastic opportunity to have a great day out to raise money for a worthwhile cause.”Tickets for the charity dog walk cost £ per adult, £. per child and all dogs go free.The cost includes a sandwich, a bottle of water and all dogs participating will receive a free doggy goody bag.

When Samaritans first started, for example, homosexuality was illegal.“But people still face the same challenges they did when that first call came in.“When there is no-one  to talk to, we’re there. That’s what is at the heart of the Samaritans – the power of human connection.”Founded on the principle that trained volunteers should answer calls, that has not changed either.And it’s something that strikes very many callers who use the service.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Aberdeenshire Councils Sustainability Committee: Cllr Martin Ford, Cllr Iain Taylor, Cllr Victoria Harper, Cllr Isobel Davidson , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  Council pledges supportto International Fair Trade Charter viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"That’s the equivalent of  days of listening in one year alone. James said: “I’ve spoken to numerous people who have used the service. “Many of them have said that knowing a volunteer is giving up their time to help them at their lowest ebb is incredibly powerful.“When people are struggling, eventhey have family and friends close by, it can be hard for them to open up and talk about what is troubling them.“That’s particularly true of Scottish men who have a reputation for being stoic and unlikely to talk about their emotions.“However, that is also now changing and the ratio of men to women calling the Samaritans is almost  .“Men are more inclined to pick up the phone nowthey are worried or sad about something as they know that they can talk to someone at the Samaritans in the strictest confidence.“When callers phone in, it’s completely anonymous. “We can’t see your phone number or where you are calling from and you don’t even have to give your nameyou don’t want to.“All of that means people can have conversations in a way they wouldn’t normally.”Men and women contact Samaritans for a wide range of reasons including isolation and loneliness, problems with mental or physical health and worries about family and relationships. Just under a third of callers also express thoughts of suicide.Volunteers also run hundreds of community events and awareness sessions, working with a wide range of organisations including schools, colleges, foodbanks, community centres, support groups, youth groups and health and emergency services.These events help spread the message that Samaritans is there for everyone.The charity also works with a range of national and local partners to ensure suicide prevention is a priority. Samaritans runs a Prison Listening Scheme, training inmates to become listening volunteers and provide peer-support.And through its work with National Rail, it has trained thousands of rail staff in suicide prevention.Of course, operating  hours a day,  days a year means the charity needs ever more volunteers to help provide its services, which now include email and text messages too.So in this diamond anniversary year, James is hopeful of recruiting an additional  volunteers.“We have up to  volunteers, more than  of whom answer calls, emails text messages and letters,” said James. “What our volunteers do is pretty demanding – when you pick up a phone, you’ve no idea what someone is going to say to you next.“Being non-judgemental is the most important quality we look for in volunteers.“Many of our callers thank us for our advice but our volunteers don’t actually give advice – they are trained in active listening, encouraging people to share their story and work through their own problems.“We are often referred to as the fourth emergency service and demand across the UK is substantial.“That demand is not going to go away and we want to make sure we’re here for people now and in  years.“But there’s a natural turn-over of volunteers so we always need to recruit more.“We could be there for even more peoplewe had more volunteers.“So we’re looking for people of all ages and from all backgrounds to get on board.“We’d love to hear from younger volunteers as we’re looking at new technology, such as webchat, to respond to people too.“In the s and s, most people came to our branches for face to face chats now almost  per cent of our contacts are via the phone and you don’t need credit on your mobile to call us.“We can’t do online chats now but we want to make sure we’re accessible to future generations so we hope to set them up soon.”John Lawrie has been a volunteer at the Edinburgh branch for  years and has witnessed many changes.As long as his hearing remains intact, the -year-old plans to continue.Initially, though, the retired investment manager had his doubts.He said: “I never thought I’d be able to do it. But in the early s, a mini series was on TV about the Samaritans and I started wonderingit was something I could do.“So, almost on the spur of the moment, I applied. “After an initial chat, I was invited to do the training.“The intervening  years have been immensely rewarding. That might sound strange but speaking to someone in a terrible state and them ringing off  minutes later, feeling better, can be really rewarding.“I’ve not changed their le they are still in the same boat as when they first called. But talking to someone  can often help them see a way forward.“It’s a privilege to be the person that they’ve opened up to.”Some calls are, of course, harrowing but volunteers are there for each other and also debrief their manager at the end of each sht.John said: “I have spoken to people who are suicidal – we’re not there to talk them out of it. “However, we do ask them to talk about why they’re feeling so bad. “The fact they’ve called the Samaritans might mean they’re not quite as certain as they say they are.”John also enjoys visiting schools. “I often worry they’ll think I’m terribly old, which I am!” he said. “But I like to think they get on better with their grandparents.“I always end my talk by saying: “I hope you never need our service but,you do, I hope you never hesitate to use it.”Someone contacts the Samaritans every six secondsToday Samaritans has grown to become the leading charity for suicide prevention with  branches across the UK and Ireland. Someone contacts the charity every six seconds.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress and crisis.People can contact Samaritans by phone, email, text, letter or by visiting their local branch. And in the coming years, the charity will be introducing new methods to provide emotional support including webchat.Today – just as  years ago – every call for help is answered by a volunteer. And to meet demand, the charity needs to recruit at least  volunteers in Scotland in . Anyone can contact Samaritans for free,  hours a day,  days a year. The service is anonymous, confidential and non-judgemental. You can get in touch by calling   or emailing Jo@samaritans.org or write to Chris, Freepost RSRB-KKBY-CYJK, PO Box , Stirling, FK SA. Alternatively, you can find your local branch at samaritans.org branches.There are  across Scotland including Stornoway, which had  contacts last year answered by  volunteers Aberdeen , Dundee ,

We now have policies like minimum unit pricing and a new alcohol strategy that acknowledges the scale of the challenge we face in Scotland.Yet despite some positive advancements in Scottish Government policy over the last decade, alcohol harm is costing Scotland £. billion annually and is still contributing to the death of people we know or love, every single day. People like -year-old Gerry from Lanarkshire – my dad – who died fouryears ago.Growing up around alcohol has a big influence over us, especially for the ,+ children in Scotland living with a problem drinker.The statistics bring home the scale of the challenge. I know, because my family has been one of them and I’ve seen first-hand how “social drinking” can spiral into full-blown dependency and destroy relationships, careers, health and happiness. During my time in Parliament, speaking up about Scotland’s relationship with alcohol has been a personal priority.I’ve raised the issue of tackling stigma directly with the First Minister and as Co-Convenor of the Cross-Party Group on Drugs and Alcohol Misuse. Addiction is an illness and problem drinking in Scotland is a public health emergency. Social stigma and corporate influences are strong, so our decision-makers need to have courage.That’s why the collaboration between the Children’s Parliament and Alcohol Focus Scotland is exciting. Young people talking openly about alcohol and how it affects them in their everyday lives is a powerful message to politicians.So, with young people pushing for change, like those in the Children’s Parliament that I’m looking forward to welcoming to the Scottish Parliament soon, I am optimistic about our future and the progress that is possible. Communities need more services and investment and that’s why Scottish Labour is committed to a social responsibility levy. The legal provision already exists for this additional tax on alcohol sales. We simply want the Scottish Government to enact this and reinvest the funds in communities and recovery programmes.A public health approach that protects young people and changes our attitudes to alcohol can make Scotland a healthier and happier nation.Monica Lennon is Scottish Labour Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"life re injected into edinburgh international film festival alistair harkness","story":"The programme launch of the Edinburgh International Film Festival has been a dispiriting affair in recent years, with too few films of note to get excited about and far too many unknown quantities proving they were unknown quantities for a reason.Opening with Edinburgh director Ninian Doff’s properly funny coming-of-age comedy Boyz in the Wood, however, the rd edition of the festival proves there’s le in the old dog yet.There is the UK premieres of Jim Jarmusch’s recent Cannes-opener The Dead Don’t Die, Joanna Hogg’s Sundance-winning The Souvenir and — headlining a commemorative retrospect — Varga by Agnès, the final film by the late, great Agnès Varda.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"eu election results find out who won all of the seats for scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...With almost all the results in from Scotland, the SNP seems likely to win three of the six Scottish MEP seats, with Scottish Labour losing its two MEPs.window.twttr Results from the  councils across Scotland showed the SNP, who fought the election campaign on a strong pro-European , had polled . per cent.The partys previous best Euro election result was . per cent in .: EU Election results: Scots reject Brexit as Labour and Conservatives humiliatedMs Sturgeon tweeted: \"Formal declaration to come, but clear now that @theSNP has won the Euro election emphatically - we are on course to take  out of  seats.

The former member of staff resigned and started official proceedings after finding an email detailing their personal health problems had allegedly been sent to another SNP MSP.In  and , the National Union of Journalists represented other employees of Ms Denham who had complained about their treatment.One staff member is said to have been given a £, compensation payment as part of a settlement agreement, which included a non-disclosure clause, after complaining they had been discriminated against on the grounds of disability.In another case, an employee was given more than £, as a “goodwill payment” when they quit their post.The person cited bullying and victimisation from within the MSP’s office – not by the MSP.An SNP spokesman said: “We do not comment on employment matters. “MSPs, in common with all employers, are able to let \u2028staff go in line with HR advice, guidance and legal requirements where their employment is no longer required.” The Scottish Parliament last year removed the non-disclosure clause from its standard settlement agreement.However, that does not rule out the use of gagging ordersboth parties agree to it.The settlement agreements used by Ms Denham for two of the cases contained non-disclosure clauses.A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: “Settlement agreements are a legitimate means of facilitating the ending of an employment relationship on mutually agreed terms and do not affect former employees’ right to make a protected disclosure such as whistleblowing.”But Labour peer Lord Foulkes told The Herald on Sunday: “This is certainly not transparent. I have a number of concerns about NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] and the way they are used to gag people. I am surprised they would be used by an elected member.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership candidates split over brexit direction","story":"Confusion over the future direction of Brexit deepened after candidates in the crowded Tory leadership contest split over whether to delay the UK#s exit from the EU, or accept a no-deal departure.Health Secretary Matt Hancock released a Brexit strategy that allows for a further delay to the UK’s exit date, joining Michael Gove and Rory Stewart in effectively ruling out no-deal.Home Secretary Sajid Javid also refused to rule out extending Britain’s departure from the EU beyond the end of October, although he claimed he “cannot envisage the circumstances” where he would do so.But Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the House of Commons whose resignation brought down Theresa May, insisted that what she called a “managed exit” without a deal can be delivered.It came as a th candidate entered the race to lead the Conservatives and become Prime Minister, with the former minister Sam Gyimah joined the field as the only candidate to support a second EU referendum.: SNP warned against dictating wording of indyref questionFormer Tory grandee Ann Widdecombe, who quit the party and was elected as an MEP for the Brexit Party, said the number of candidates showed the Conservatives had “gone mad”.Unveiling his Brexit plan, Mr Hancock said that the “real choice is between leaving with a deal and no Brexit,” adding that “no-deal Brexit is not a policy choice available to the next Prime Minister”.Pledging to be “honest about the trade offs as we leave the EU”, he said it was impossible to have complete control over the UK’s laws while maintaining frictionless access to trade.Mr Hancock said that as Prime Minister, he would “immediately” enshrine the rights of EU citizens living in the UK in law, and set up an “Irish Border Council” to resolve the most dficult issue in Brexit talks.Modelled on multiparty negotiations to secure the peace process, the council would also include representatives from the Republic of Ireland and the EU to develop a solution to the border issue that is acceptable to all sides.However, he also said he would seek a time-limit to the border backstop element of the UK’s Brexit deal, something that the EU has repeatedly rejected.Meanwhile, appearing on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said the Irish border was “the tail that wags the dog” on Brexit and said new technology could avoid the need for the backstop, which would keep the UK under EU trading rulesno solution for the border is found.“We need to make sure we can do more to build that goodwill in Ireland and build their confidence,” the Home Secretary said.”What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border.“I think it could be done in a couple of years, but I think we could cover their costs.”Mr Javid was asked whether he would ask to delay Brexit beyond the end of October, and said: “I’m clear that my plan would be to leave on October . I want to leave with a deal butI have to choose between no-deal and no Brexit I would pick no deal.”But pressed again, he added: “That’s not something I would do, but we are a parliamentary democracy and what we’ve seen in the last few months is Parliament has taken on some extraordinary powers to initiate its own legislation soit’s statute,it’s the law, I would not break the lawI was prime minister, of course I would observe the law.”In her own interview on the Andrew Marr Show, Ms Leadsom unveiled a “three-step plan for a managed exit” which she insisted was not the same as leaving without a deal.“I think it’s based on the premise that, number one, we have to leave the EU at the end of October, and, number two, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead - the EU won’t reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and the UK Parliament won’t vote for it,” she said.Meanwhile, in a series of posts on social media, Mr Stewart said no-deal Brexit was a “recipe for further delay and uncertainty” that would undermine the UK’s “ years of reputation for economic competence”.The International Development Secretary received a signicant endorsement from within the Cabinet as David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, said Mr Stewart’s unconventional style had “real strengths” and could win an election.Mr Gauke also said he would not be able to serve in a cabinet which pursued leaving without a deal as its “objective”.“I don’t think you can completely take it off the table because the European Union might refuse any kind of extension and we might find ourselves in that situation,” Mr Gauke said.“So I accept that we should prepare for it butit is an objective in saying ‘no-deal is the right answer’ I wouldn’t support that policy, I wouldn’t be able to serve in a cabinet that pursued that policy.”Mr Stewart also won support the former Chancellor and Father of the House, veteran pro-EU Tory Kenneth Clarke, while former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said she would back Mr Gove.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"the edinburgh fintech powerhouse oiling the nation s financial transactions","story":"Sandra Dick celebrates three decades of Scotland#s longest-established fintech firm and congratulates its MD, Anthony RaffertyIt was the year of the Poll Tax, Tiananmen Square protests and the fall of the Berlin Wall we danced to Stock, Aitken and Waterman records and no fewer than  million people tuned into Coronation Street to see the then resident baddie hit by a tram. While football fans cheered Scotland’s qualication for the World Cup in Italy, at CERN in Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee was sharpening his pencil. It would be a further year before the computer scientist’s idea for an information sharing system came to fruition and he would be mulling over whether to call it The Mine of Information, The Information Mesh or just the World Wide Web. However, back in , in a horseshoe-shaped building at Heriot-Watt University known as the Origo Centre, another idea was rapidly evolving. Years ahead of its time – and possibly unforeseen by the handful of staff working there – it would go on to stake a claim as one of the UK’s first fintech businesses and – perhaps most surprising of all –continue at the forefront of the rapidly evolving sector for the next three decades. This year marks the th anniversary of Origo, the fintech powerhouse behind countless financial transactions and a key component in ensuring the nation’s financial services sector can interact faster, with less fuss and more security to bring a fluid, seamless service to its professionals and their customers. What started with just three people brought together as the s drew to a close with a vision for a behind-the-scenes framework which would enable financial service providers to communicate electronically, has now ballooned in scale,and expertise.Today, Origo employs  fintech experts. Its initial innovation, Open Standards – devised to enable the financial services to securely operate using a common set of protocols, technical details and data – is now just one component in a suite of innovative products that raise efficiency and improve outcomes for a range of businesses, organisations, financial advisers and their clients. But it’s not every day you’re . So how does the nation’s original Fintech celebrate  According to Anthony Rafferty, Origo’s managing director, there is just one way for the business that laid the foundations of Scotland’s burgeoning fintech sector to mark the occasion – and that’s to work even harder. “Origo is going from strength to strength,” he says. “We are probably the UK’s and certainly Scotland’s longest-established fintech, but we are definitely not complacent.”The MD may be considered something of a new-start compared to ‘employee number one’, Laura Reed, who turned up for work as a personal assistant on that first day in  and remains with the firm three decades on as executive assistant, but he is far from a stranger to the business. Rafferty arrived in January  with a solid career behind him in financial service businesses – among them RBS, Bank of Scotland and latterly Aviva – that make every day use of Origo’s backroom technology to ensure smoother, smarter transactions. It was a bit like coming home for Rafferty – he was raised in Wester Hailes, a stone’s throw from that Heriot-Watt building where it all began. And it should be borne in mind that Origo was established a year before the first web browser was launched. Rafferty reflects: “Pension and le insurance companies must have been bemoaning the fact that doing stuff electronically was expensive and for the financial advisers they were interacting with, it was very inconsistent, because each company was doing it dferently.”Initially, four financial services businesses were on board with Origo. Two operators seconded from Standard Le and Norwich Union were charged with establishing common processes which would ensure that everyone involved spoke the same technical language, so issues such as getting quotes and sending data became so much more simple and secure. Before long the operation’s original name, Open Framework for Intermediary Services, was changed to Origo and its first portal – its ground-breaking Open Standards – was launched  months after. Flick the calendar forward dramatically and Origo is now based at Edinburgh Park and owned by  UK financial services shareholders – among them Aviva, Scottish Widows, Aegon, Prudential and Standard Le – whose priceless input ensures that its products are precisely what the industry needs and wants. The scale of Origo’s contribution to the financial services sector is impressive its fintech solutions provide secure access for eight-out-of-ten UK financial advisers to a wide range of financial businesses, enabling them to authenticate themselves instantly and carry out fuss-free, fast transactions on behalf of their clients. At the same time, Origo engages with a range of industry bodies, s, portals, software suppliers and government bodies to seek out ways to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Among its most signicant products is the Origo Transfer Service. Launched in , it has smoothed the passage of £ billion worth of pension and ISA transfers, providing a faster and safer system which benefits financial advisers, their clients and financial services business.At last count, the innovation was being used by almost  financial service companies. The transfer technology means that a transaction that might oncehave taken several weeks to carry out is cut to a few days and, in some cases, hours. Nevertheless, it is just one of a range of Origo services. And with  years behind it, Rafferty is clear on what the ‘magic formula’ is for the fintech’s success. “We have been quite canny in how we have done things,” he says. “Because we’re owned by  dferent financial service companies, we have access to the users of our services. “We have great focus groups with key users of potential services who help to influence development plans. We research things well with our customer base – we tend to get things right.”One example is the Origo Integration Hub. Designed for s and adviser software systems, users just plug in once to open up connections with every other hub party. It helps protect against risk, lowers costs and takes care of any operational or legislative changes.  In the spirit of constant evolution, Origo has now launched a new tracking element, so financial advisers can follow clients’ transfers online in real-time, eliminating the prospect of chasing for progress updates. “We stay very close to customers,” Rafferty adds. “Our second key ingredient is that our staff are world experts in fintech. That’s really important. “Thirdly, we are creative and flexible. We try stuff out and we are not afraid to fail. We check out ideas, but we don’t test stubbornly and continueit’s not working.”Launching soon is a highly-secure e-mail service, which Rafferty describes as a “game changer”. “It’s relatively easy for fraudsters to read someone’s e-mail as it goes over the internet,” he explains. “It’s no safer than sending a postcard with your bank details through the post, and even encrypted e-mails have problems. “We are launching Unipass Mailock for securing e-mails. Unipass is already well known –  per cent of financial advisers use it every day.”Unipass Mailock features world-class encryption so users can be confident their message is only read by intended recipients with an automatic read receipt as standard. It also removes the terror of an accidental ‘send’ users can recall an e-mail and remove all trace of it. Rafferty is full of praise for FinTech Scotland and Scottish Financial Enterprise’s efforts to nurture new businesses, support the more established and recognise their efforts. It’s a source of pride that Origo was among five businesses shortlisted for Scottish Financial Enterprise’s  Scottish Financial Services Award.And, of course, he is constantly looking forward – blockchain technology is just one area being scrutinised by Origo – keen to broaden the fintech’s horizons, perhaps to an international level.“I’d like to think that in  years’ time we’ll be celebrating  years of Origo all over the world,” he adds. “There’s huge potential to do what we do in other countries.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"west lothian cat owner catches incredible moment tiny mouse fends off cat named tom","story":"A photographer captured a real-le Tom and Jerry battle as a tiny rodent survives an epic encounter against its feline tormentor - called Tom.The extraordinary pictures, taken by Gordon McBrearty, , show his pet tabby Tom toying with the tiny mouse in his garden.The pair faced a y  minute standoff as the intrepid mouse squared up to the tabby in an unbelievable face-off.The curious cat seemed to forget the pair are supposed to be sworn enemies as she sat back and watched the mouse stand on its hind legs to clean its whiskers.At one point the mouse even appears to jump up and down in a bid to scare the cat away.During the set-to Tom, a two-year-old female, picked up the feisty rodent in its jaws before dropping it - as the relieved creature escaped and ran off.Gordon, from Uphall, West Lothian, watched the brave standoff from his kitchen window and couldnt believe it when the mouse survived the encounter.He said: \"It was in the morning I was in the kitchen and looked out and could see the mouse was still alive.\"I photographed it over a period of ten to  minutes.\"The mouse escaped into a woodpile then my we saw the mouse again, hiding under a plant pot.\"We heard a magpie making a hell of a racket, it mustve been wanting a piece of the action.\"\"Tom would walk over to me almost showing off and as the mouse tried to run away, she would run over and jump on it.\"Every now and again the wee mouse would sit up on its hind legs and clean its whiskers.\"Its the type of thing a lot of people see but rarely photograph.\"With the light it worked incredibly well.\"For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst.

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree.

The film screening will be followed by a discussion led by environmentalist Corin Smith.Alon Schwabe of Cooking Sections explained why he believed this project was so vital. He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

They get to meet the young ones and they’ve prepared lunch for the kids so they’ll get to sit down and have a meal together where the young ones can learn about the service provided here.”She added: “The garden is looking impressive with all the dferent colours. The young ones are putting their mark on the garden, which is great.”Michael McAllister from Leonard Cheshire Disability commented: “It’s good to get the guys involved in this project.“This is the third day we’ve been here and we’re getting ready for the barbecue next week. It’s been good fun, but it’s a good opportunity for the young people to get involved with Rosemount House.“It’s a good education for them. It’s also about creating more awareness in Belfast about homelessness. This is a real positive project for the young people to be involved in.”Michael Bradley, who lectures at Belfast Met, said: “Partnering up with Leonard Cheshire gives young people the chance to give back to the community. They’re also developing teamwork skills and communication skills. They’re able to help the community, but it’s also part of their qualication too.”He added: “One of the residents came in one day and spoke to the young ones about the choices that he made that led him here. It had quite a big impact on the students, because they could relate to it in some ways. It’s really striking a note with them.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"boundary commission acted unfairly on proposed constituency changes","story":"SINN Féin MP Paul Maskey has welcomed a decision from the High Court which found that the Boundary Commission acted unfairly when it failed to consider responses to a consultation on proposed constituency changes.The new proposals published last year would have cut the number of constituencies from  to .In February, a Belfast man brought a judicial review challenging the proposals claiming the Commission has acted unlawfully and unfairly.On Tuesday, a High Court judge identied a legal flaw in their final recommendations.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said, #I welcome today#s verdict from the High Court which found there had been legal flaws in the Boundary Commission’s recommendations for changes to constituencies in the north.#The judgement today found that responses to the consultation on the proposals were not fully considered.#This case was brought by a Belfast man who was concerned about the proposed changes.#All responses to consultations should be fully and equally considered.#Everyone has the right to a fair representation and that requires a fair process.#Speaking outside Court, PL’s legal representative Eoin Murphy of Ó Muirigh Solicitors said:“The signicance of Parliamentary boundaries for representation at the highest level of our democracy is obvious. Once the recommendations are adopted, they will be dficultnot impossible to change for at least the next election, which may affect how inidual constituents are represented for several years.

Given the very signicant effects of any legal error on the part of the Commission – and the essentially irreparable nature of those errors, the Court quite correctly exercised an intense level of scrutiny and arrived at the correct conclusion that the Boundary Commission had fallen into legal error and acted in a procedurally unfair way in this instance.”A further hearing on the th June  will decide on the final remedies and order in the case."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"largest tv in ireland on sale in west belfast electronic store","story":"CUSTOMERS in Noel Grimley Electrics did a double take on Wednesday afternoon as the latest in TV technology was unveiled.The ” Samsung QLED, the first in the north, was unveiled – just in time for Saturday’s Champions League final between Liverpool and Spurs.“It’s great to see the TV displayed in the store,” said owner Eamon Grimley, “we are a big Samsung dealer and were the first in the north to sell the K TV.

Previously you couldn’t mirror your iPhone to your TV but you can with this and you can access BT Sport so long as you have the app. If it’s being mounted on the wall and it’s not being used you can upload your own photos, have your own picture collage, a clock, the weather, news headlines coming up, you can change the colour of the background to blend in with your wall.“Grimleys are the first to have it and we expect a lot of interest over the coming days.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the west belfast chef making waves at the malone lodge hotel","story":"JOBS in the food service industry are renowned for being intense and testing but also equally exciting, therefore, having worked as a chef for  years West Belfast man Liam Mooney’s journey in the culinary world has undoubtedly been an interesting one. In April, he took up the head chef post at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where he had previously worked as a Senior Sous Chef before a seven-year spell working abroad. Although his new role may be viewed as a veritable homecoming, it could well be his most exciting challenge yet.Liam first started his career in the industry working as a waiter in the Europa Hotel – a summer job that would soon see him step behind the line in the kitchen. Reflecting on those early days, the Clonard man said: “The passion of the chefs had for food, the flavours and the way they were plating stuff up really inspired me. It was good to see that buzz in the kitchen.“Yes, it is a stressful environment, but the guys all have fun. They all work towards one goal and they’re all one big family. It doesn’t matter what kitchen you go into, they’re all family –one person goes down they all go down, which just shows the teamwork. When I first watched the guys in the Europa it just bit me and I wanted to be a chef after that.”Liam’s flair for cooking and his desire to learn inspired him to gain chef’s qualications, and garnered further opportunities including the chance to work at the inimitable James Street South.He later went to work at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where his skills brought critical acclaim in  he became one of six finalists in prestigious European Chef of the Year Awards. Liam was the only chef in the finals from a non-Michelin starred restaurant and eventually picked up a bronze award for his five-course menu that showcased the best local and seasonal produce. His passion for seasonality and high-quality produce is something that has stuck with him to this day.“I like to stick to the classics,” he explained.“Classics are classics for a reason. Sometimes I’ll twist it as best as I can, but I always try to keep the flavours clean and seasonal. It’s basically just good food that everybody can enjoy. It doesn’t matter what your dietary requirement, we can cater for it.“We’ll always try to make a dish that is gluten free or dairy free so that we don’t have to tell people they can’t have it. We’ll twist a classic dish to more clean or refined flavours so that everybody can enjoy it.”When Liam left Belfast for Guernsey seven years ago he felt it may well have been for good. His move brought success, of course – he headed the team at Guernsey’s most popular restaurant, the Slaughterhouse – however, when the Malone Lodge offered him a new opportunity it was a challenge he could not pass up, and one he is meeting with his typical enthusiasm for food.“I’ve been bringing seasonality back into the restaurant. I’ve been making Macklin’s Bar back into a bar where people can come for a few pints and have chicken, ribs – bringing back real pub grub,” he said.“We’re making sure the lobby is buzzing again with people enjoying scones, teas, coffees and paninis – just having a bit to eat and drink and relaxing.“We’re bringing the restaurant back to what it was a nice hotel restaurant that is there for families, kids, and everybody so that they can have a nice sit down meal. It’s not just for customers who are staying in the hotel – it’s for the people of the area, people from all over Belfast, or people just visiting.”He continued: “The response has been very very good. I’ve come in at a crazy time with tour groups coming in, we’ve had holy communions coming in, but the feedback has all been positive. People like what they see happening and what they’re getting, and they like that they are getting good value for money.”Although Liam felt he might live in his home city again, he insists hiswas the right move. With Belfast’s ever growing food culture and tourism industry, it could not have come at a better time.“Belfast has always been a booming city – it’s basically like a mini London,” he said.“It is always evolving and the food is always evolving. We have some amazing chefs. You have people like Stevie Tolman, who is a Michelin starred chef at OX – I worked with him in James Street South – I think it’s amazing what he does. Every chef bouncing off each other is the whole point of it.“I think it’s brilliant for Belfast’s tourism and the city as a whole. We’re able to show how we’re moving forward to a better place. You can actually go out now and enjoy a nice meal. When I was younger you maybe went out for your communion and you were luckyyou got a steak. People are now trying dferent things, they’re experimenting with food, and they are opening their minds to the dferent things you can eat. There are a lot of Asian restaurants and a lot of other multicultural restaurants in Belfast, which brings a lot of passion and a lot of enjoyment for everybody.”He continued: “I’m happy that I’ve been asked to come back and take over the kitchen. It brings a lot of pride because I was here when it was the old restaurant and then I was here when it got done up.“It’s good to be able to show these guys in the kitchen where hard work gets you and what we can do together. I want to give a bit of guidance and teach them things that I’ve learned and the stuff that I’m still learning. I’ve been away for seven years, but I’m proud to be back. I would have come back maybe once a year, but I’ve always missed Belfast and I’ve always been a West Belfast boy, so I’m glad I got the opportunity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sajid javid would make grand gesture to irish government by covering costs of new digitised border in ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Javid continued: \"In my departmentat the moment Ive got border force and weve done work for months on what an alternative to that arrangement could look like and whats missing is that good will. \"What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. \"I think it could be done in a couple of years but I think we could cover their costs.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38163421.ece/9197d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/plaza.jpg","title":"belfast benefit centre staff spat out of windows and hurled objects onto the street below","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dolores Kelly’s comments also stray into this territory.\"Mr Chambers said operational matters and decisions taken by the PSNI are entirely the responsibility of the Chief Constable George Hamilton.\"Holding the Chief Constable to account for his operational actions is the role of the Policing Board and I believe that these public comments from two members of the Board are a clear attempt to interfere in and influence operational decisions, and are extremely unwise,\" Mr Chambers said. Millions of journalistic documents and digital files were seized when Durham police raided the homes and offices of the documentary film-makers in Belfast last August with support from the PSNI.A judge ruled earlier this week that the documents and files should be ed.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on.

Notwithstanding their success at the polls, the Brexit Party and fellow travellers only managed to equal the number of votes gained by remainers. And in Northern Ireland the election merely underlined that a majority of people here want to remain in the EU.Read MoreMEPs to earn £, plus expenses for four months’ work...Brexit happens in OctoberEilis OHanlon: Why we should celebrate Northern Ireland having three female MEPsAlban Maginness: Old political certainties well and truly swept away by historic Euro electionEU election results: Diane Dodds, Naomi Long and Martina Anderson are Northern Irelands MEPs amid Alliance vote surgeThat is not to dismiss either Brexit or Alliance who performed magnicently, chiefly by giving voters a clear message on where they stood. For Alliance it showed there is a middle ground between the DUP and Sinn Fein and that it is best placed at this moment to occupy it.Now the action switches to Westminster and the backstabbing free-for-all that will pass as a Tory party leadership campaign. Up to  candidates could take part but it seems inevitable that any winner will have to be a committed Brexiteer.That will be music to the ears of the DUP who will continue to hold the balance of power in Parliament and one Tory leadership candidate, Jeremy Hunt, has already promised to include them in his negotiating team, although why they had not insisted in being on Theresa Mays team in the first instance is a puzzle.The problem for any potential new Prime Minister is that none of the candidates has come up with a feasible alternative to the border backstop which has always been the stumbling block in finding an acceptable exit agreement. Brexit is like Northern Irelands devolution impasse. Everyone knows what the problems are but no one is prepared to compromise to break the logjam. The worry in parochial terms is that the current Stormont talks will run into the ground through lack of interest from Westminster, the DUPs pivotal position in Parliament which will demand a lot of the partys energies, and Sinn Feins soul searching after poor election performances in the Republic and a less than glowing effort on this side of the border.Meanwhile, the UK has to leave the EU by Halloween at the latest, a ghoulish prospect given that many of the Tory leadership candidates are avowed leave at any cost purists."},{"url":null,"title":"full recount ordered for ireland south european parliament constituency","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On the left, the Labour Party characterises business as the real enemy. On the right, the argument for radical tax cuts, deregulation and smaller government is gaining ground, just as our population demographics are making them harder to do.“And as we look to rebuild the case for centre ground politics we should take a bold step in writing the next chapter in the story of statutory minimum wages in the UK. “A story which began under the Labour government of  – but which took a giant step forward under the Conservative government in  – so that we demonstrate once again that the well-regulated market delivers for all our people.”He said a gap had opened up in Britain and other developed countries between the “theory of how a market economy and free trade creates and distributes wealth and the reality experienced by many ordinary people”.“We ignore that gap at our peril becausewe do not address it, it will be filled with the reckless promises of the populists,” he warned. “But that doesn’t mean we should abandon our economic model.“So, for those like me who believe passionately that harnessing the power of market economics is the only way to deliver progress… it is imperative that we take decisive action to show that the regulated market model can deliver higher wages and higher living standards.”Mr Hammond earlier hinted that he would support a second referendumParliament cannot resolve Brexit. He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “If we do get to the point where Parliament does admit that it cannot resolve the situation, then it will have to be remitted back to the people.“I am not sure that a general election can resolve the question for the simple reason that both the main political parties are ided on the issues. This is a ision that runs not between the parties, but through the parties.“We need a period of calm now before contemplating the possibility of a general election.“My strong preference is for Parliament to resolve this butParliament can’t resolve it, then Parliament will have to decide how we remit it back to the people, whether it is in the form of a general election, or a referendum.”"},{"url":null,"title":"catherine of aragon leaves twitter users puzzled as the former queen trends","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use.

They represented the district so well at Irish level and again at world level in Abu Dhabi, bringing home medals.Mr Murnin also referred to the success of the inaugural Be Active Cup involving soccer teams from opposite sides of the council area. He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me.

As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees.

The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief. We are also grateful to our parents for their continued support and loyalty.The Bishopscourt playgroup will be taking part in a sponsored bag pack at the Asda supermarket in Downpatrick this Saturday between am and pm. Volunteers are welcome to get involved..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"There’s no way Lynch can lose  ","story":"DONARD, Commedagh, Bernagh, Binnian mdash everyone knowrsquos them, the higher peaks in the beautul mountain range that is the Mournes mdash a place that all who hail from south east Down are proud to call home.There are loads more minors peaks and hillocks in the  square miles that are great fun to explore and after decades of Hill  Dales the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo decided last winter that he would dream up a new route for one of the  series.First there was the venue mdash Meelmore Lodge. If you havenrsquot been to Meelmore Lodge lately, then go check it out. A signicant amount of investment has been done there and therersquos great parking facilities and easy access to the Ulster Way under the shadow of Meelmore .Therersquos accommodation there, including pods and plenty of camping spaces - great for a night out. The race exited the campsite with the organisers issuing strict instructions for runners not to cross walls or fences, except through an open gate where a marshal would be there to direct them.Wet tops were the order of the day, for while it was mild and dry, but there were a few ominous grey clouds around and once up near to , feet the climate conditions can be much more challenging.By the way, one of the race directorsdecided it would be wise to recce the course earlier in the week.So on Monday evening meeting at the above-mentioned stunning Meelmore Lodge, he gathered with a few so-called running mates. They set off, quickly deciding to start the race on the green paddock below the lodge .The decision to start there had far-reaching consequences for just adjacent to the chosen start location, come Thursday at pm, a camping couple decided to cook dinner on a makesht stove - they must have been planning a quiet romantic evening with stunning views and just as they had sat down, Frank Morgan, the perennial starterwith his flags and tape followed soon after by hundreds of runners and spectators gathering beside them - no need for them to put on the TV, they had all the live entertainment they needed.Back to Monday evening and the lsquocourse recce crewrsquo followed the Trassey river, crossing it before the hard climb up Slievenaglough, then following the green shoot up to the first check point at its summit.Then it was the technical descent down and up to the summit of lesser-known Lukersquos Mountain and from there making their way home.Mountain leader and rescue stalwart, Ian McCracken fell not once, but twice going over on his ankle badly mdash thankfully, no need for the mountain rescue as the lsquoProphetrsquo was there to guide him home safely mdash poor Ian, after all the winter preparation there would be no Thursday evening race for him.As the runners milled around , Pete Grant, who was surprisingly wearing his club vest for a change, must have had a category win on his mind, as he moaned and groaned about the long, sharp start, delaying the time before he could get his shoes properly mucky.Later on, however, that would be the least of his worries as for some reason he decided to leave his car keys somewhere out on the open mountain at a grid reference that to the present time only God knows.As Frankrsquos whistle was blown at ::the  runners charged off up the track and onto the open mountain.The route, mostly on sheep paths, took them directly onto the craggy summit of Slievenaglough that is part of the Mourne Wall route - a mountain that meant something on Thursday evening rather than just being an anonymous part of the route from the Harersquos Gap to Commedagh.Positively, pretty much everyone successfully reached the cut-off point of  minutes for the first mile that included around  feet of climbing.Newcastle ACrsquos Seamy Lynch had established a comfortable lead early in the race, clear of his club mate Mark Stephens with Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson also comfortable in the womanrsquos race, ahead of Karen Wilton from Lisburn and Mourne runner Sarah Graham.It should have been plain sailing for everyone, but as often happens, the low cloud rolled in onto the ridge between Slievenaglough and Lukersquos and the summit of Lukersquos disappeared from view. We are still not sure that everyone made it there, but what is certain is that everyone made it back.Legal counsel Higgins lives le in the fast lane, balancing defending the indefensible in one court room or another with le on the farm and a Viking love nest in Tullybrannigan.If therersquos controversy in a sport not known for its controversy, Higgins perhaps will not be too far away - gamekeeper turned poacher  On the way home he chose his own line and clearly there had been some pillow talk, for she did too - slightly dferent, but both probably crossed the moral line, but probably not far enough to be eligible for a criminal conviction.His talk of bringing his finely honed orienteering skills to the table was not convincing the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo, but despite his protests supported strongly by the lsquoHenrsquo, the directors have no appetite for years in court ending in the European Court of Justice, no doubt, so the results stand.A fine run from Ballydrain junior Jared Martin to come home in third - a big star for the future  Many of the runners remarked this was the best HD course in years and it was great to freshen the series up with a new route - food for thought for the organisers for  Many thanks to all at Meelmore Lodge for the use of their facilities in this beautul location, the marshals, time keepers and people behind the scenes who keep the series running smoothly each week.Thanks also to the Avoca Hotel  Spa on their excellent food and beverages, by order of Jack OrsquoHare.Tomorrow night sees theto Millstone with full body cover required.

She said: “It has been another great show, and we’ve been very lucky with the weather. “A big thank you to everyone who contributed to the success of our th annual show, especially ABC Council, Translink and principal sponsor ABP. We are also indebted to the many iniduals who give so freely of their time to organise the show.”The cattle and sheep sections attracted a iety of continental, native and traditional breeds.Leading the cattle parade and securing the award for the supreme champion of champions was the Holstein cow Glasson Goldfish Form Erle VG from Philip and Simon Haffey’s -cow herd at Portadown. A second prize winner at Balmoral Show, she calved her third in March and is producing  litres of milk every day. Originating from the noted Erle family at Smiddiehill, her granddam was the ,gns Field of Dreams Formation Erle. The Haffey family have won seven successive Holstein championships at Lurgan Show. Interbreed cattle judge Cyril Millar, from Coleraine, described the overall show champion as a spectacular specimen of the breed. “It’s never an easy task judging beef cattle against dairy cattle, and the exhibitors deserve credit for putting on a tremendous show of quality animals. “Today’s overall winner is a flashy dairy cow with great power and scope. She has a big open frame, a well attached udder, and walks well on sound legs and feet.”Taking the reserve supreme award was the interbreed beef winner, an Aberdeen Angus heer from Richard and Fiona McKeown’s Herd at Templepatrick. This home-bred heer was born in April , and secured the reserve breed titles at Balmoral and Lurgan.  Cyril Millar added: “This heer is a peach of a beast, and a very close second. She oozes breed character from head to toe, and has great conformation and muscle.”Runner-up in the interbreed beef line-up was the two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Nikki exhibited by Nigel and Gail Matchett from Portadown.  in Corncord Avenue, Banbury \"   in Corncord Avenue, Banbury \"  New - Police in specic appeal over tragic death in Banbury Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Claiming top honours in the rare breed cattle section was the Dexter champion Rathnafishogue T Bone owned by Ryan Laverty from Aghalee.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: “It has been another great show, and we’ve been very lucky with the weather. “A big thank you to everyone who contributed to the success of our th annual show, especially ABC Council, Translink and principal sponsor ABP. We are also indebted to the many iniduals who give so freely of their time to organise the show.”The cattle and sheep sections attracted a iety of continental, native and traditional breeds.Leading the cattle parade and securing the award for the supreme champion of champions was the Holstein cow Glasson Goldfish Form Erle VG from Philip and Simon Haffey’s -cow herd at Portadown. A second prize winner at Balmoral Show, she calved her third in March and is producing  litres of milk every day. Originating from the noted Erle family at Smiddiehill, her granddam was the ,gns Field of Dreams Formation Erle. The Haffey family have won seven successive Holstein championships at Lurgan Show. Interbreed cattle judge Cyril Millar, from Coleraine, described the overall show champion as a spectacular specimen of the breed. “It’s never an easy task judging beef cattle against dairy cattle, and the exhibitors deserve credit for putting on a tremendous show of quality animals. “Today’s overall winner is a flashy dairy cow with great power and scope. She has a big open frame, a well attached udder, and walks well on sound legs and feet.”Taking the reserve supreme award was the interbreed beef winner, an Aberdeen Angus heer from Richard and Fiona McKeown’s Herd at Templepatrick. This home-bred heer was born in April , and secured the reserve breed titles at Balmoral and Lurgan.  Cyril Millar added: “This heer is a peach of a beast, and a very close second. She oozes breed character from head to toe, and has great conformation and muscle.”Runner-up in the interbreed beef line-up was the two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Nikki exhibited by Nigel and Gail Matchett from Portadown.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades.

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones. The fastest speed possible when EE launched G in  was just Mbps.” Marc Allera, chief executive, of BT’s consumer ision, says: “This is the start of the UK’s G journey and great news for our customers that want and need the best connections. We’ve started with G in some of the busiest parts of the UK, the widest range of G devices in the UK, and plans that give customers the best mobile connection and great benefits. “We’re adding G to the UK’s number one G network to increase reliability, increase speeds, and keep our customers connected where they need it most.  “G will create new experiences with augmented reality, make our customers’ lives easier, and help launch entirely new businesses that we haven’t even imagined. We’re upgrading more than  sites to G every month from today to connect more places to what G can enable.” Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of Belfast Council, said: “Digital connectivity is at the heart of our strategy for the growth of Belfast. G is key to making our ambitions a reality. It will drive our economy forward and enable Belfast to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. Being one of the first G enabled cities in the UK is an exciting prospect for us, and will bring our businesses and citizens the best mobile connectivity in Europe. “G connectivity will ensure our city remains competitive, indigenous businesses grow and big global brands continue to build their businesses in Belfast and support our ongoing digital advancement.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sign_1.jpg","title":"across the borderline export focus","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business The export market is booming in cross-border areas in and around Newry, but how will things change post-Brexit  Pavel Barter checks out the pulse of businesses in the region As the morning sun illuminates the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, a team of workers carry bags of oysters from the water to the beach. They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.
