They have done what they once told me not to do – they are believing everything negative that has been written about me. So I am reaching out to them, once again, to try to correct the lies and get the truth out there.‘Everyone says, why don’t I just shut the f*** up? That Meghan can’t speak to me because I’ll give away secrets. But that’s bull****. I’ve been accused of every terrible thing you can think of. In one magazine they had an awful story about Prince Charles right beside one about me. But no one is shunning Prince Charles.’Prince Harry went \u0027mental\u0027 and \u0027accused William of trying to...It\u0027s Meg\u0027s party! Prince William and Kate SKIP a board...Share this articleThis is just his fourth interview since the fall-out with Harry and Meghan after he staged paparazzi pictures shortly before the couple’s wedding in May and then suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.Today, in a wide-ranging interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Markle, for the first time, categorically rejects some of the most ‘grievous’ lies against him and produces evidence in the form of photographs, medical statements and even a faded plane ticket that he says proves he is telling the truth:          They are the words of love from a daughter who clearly adores her father. In a Valentine\u0027s card, Meghan writes: \u0027Daddy, Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. ‘All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – her childhood nickname‘Everything has been met with a stony silence. Their silence means people continue to attack me and write lies about me.’Mr Markle says he has been surprised by a spate of recent negative stories about his daughter that portray her as a petulant a.One claimed she reduced a staff member to tears with her 5am demands and another said she wanted to spray air freshener around ‘musty’ St George’s Chapel – a request rejected by the Queen.Perhaps the most damaging claim concerns an alleged rift between Meghan and Kate, who is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ by Meghan’s demands over Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid gown and who later, allegedly, reprimanded Meghan for ‘berating’ a member of her staff.Kate is said to have told Meghan: ‘That’s unacceptable. They’re my staff and I speak to them.’Meghan’s father says he is baffled by the reports. ‘I don’t recognise this person,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘The Meghan I know was always sweet, kind, generous. She was always demanding but never rude. I don’t want to say or do anything to hurt my daughter but I worry she is going to hurt herself.’And in a Christmas card, left, showing a colourful llama, she writes: ‘Because you have always been so generous with me… it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’ Inside was a gift of $2,000 for a holidayMr Markle, a retired Emmy award-winning Hollywood lighting director, adds: ‘Meghan grew up on set. I taught her to have respect for the crew. They can make you look good or awful. I don’t pretend to know what she’s like now.‘She bends the rules. She’s good at that. But this acting up is new. She’s never been rude to me before. I can’t believe I’ve done anything severe enough to be treated this way by her.’ Indeed, he believes his bond with Meghan is ‘unbreakable’ – a point illustrated by two cards from his treasured collection.Meghan trained as a calligrapher and wrote wedding invitations to help support herself through the early days of her acting career, a skill highlighted in her cards to her father, which are written in elegant cursive script.‘I loved getting cards from Meghan,’ Mr Markle says. ‘She wrote me hundreds of little cards and notes through the years. Sometimes they were for special occasions, other times just little notes she would leave around the house. I’ve still got a Post-It Note on my fridge which says, “I love you Daddy.” I see it every day. I got a card every Valentine’s Day.’ He pulls one Valentine’s card from a manila folder. It shows a picture of a chubby baby holding a daffodil with a touching message: ‘Daddy… I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me. Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – a reference to his childhood nickname for her.    Mr Markle suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor when she married Prince Harry - who he is yet to meetOver the years, Mr Markle ‘willingly’ spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his daughter, sending her to private school and even cashing in Facebook shares to help pay for her first wedding.A Christmas card showing a llama and the words ‘Fa-La-La Llama’ arrived at Mr Markle’s Mexican home just a couple of years ago, by which time Meghan was a successful actress, earning $50,000 (£40,000) an episode on the hit TV show Suits. The card contained $2,000 for him to put towards a holiday. She wrote: ‘Daddy, Because you have always been so generous with me and taken the best care of me it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’For Mr Markle, the prospect of never speaking to his daughter again is unbearable: ‘I’m hurt by what’s happened but I’m not going to stay silent.          In a wide-ranging interview with Caroline Graham near his home in Mexico, Mr Markle revealed the anguish he feels at the thought of never seeing his daughter again‘My life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry. When they announced her pregnancy I had seven paparazzi on my doorstep night and day for seven days. They rented the house next door.‘Their treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I’m being punished for things I didn’t say.‘I’m trolled on the internet by one guy who sits in his mother’s basement spewing lies about me. Twitter is the worst but I can’t avoid it.‘I don’t read things but then people send them to me anyway. They say I faked my heart attacks, that I wasn’t at the first wedding. It’s all bull****. Meghan and I never had any problems before this.‘If she would just speak to me, things could be different. I love Meghan very much. I want her and Harry to have a beautiful, healthy baby and a great life.‘But I want them to stop believing the lies.’Does he believe he and Meghan will ever be reunited?He shrugs. ‘Maybe. Some day.’  \u0027I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown\u0027: Thomas Markle unveils touching photograph that proves he DID go to his daughter\u0027s first wedding but said no to the party bag marijuana He was reduced to what he calls ‘a footnote in history’ when two heart attacks prevented him from walking his daughter Meghan down the aisle of St George’s Chapel amid the pomp and pageantry of the Royal Wedding in May.But Thomas Markle did take a starring role at Meghan’s very different first wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson in 2011, which took place under swaying palm trees on a Jamaican beach, complete with a Caribbean steel drum band and a most unusual welcome gift for the guests.Mr Markle says he is ‘sick and tired’ of reading erroneous reports that he failed to attend the wedding, which sadly ended in orce for the couple two years later. He explains that he asked the photographer to ignore him and concentrate on the young people showing off their beautiful bodies in swimwear.          The invitationto Meghan’s first wedding showed her entwined with Trevor on a beach with a beer‘There are no pictures out there of me at the wedding because it was on the beach and everyone else was in their 30s and I was in my 60s’, Mr Markle said last night, before showing The Mail on Sunday a photograph – published here for the first time. It shows him posing proudly with Meghan just moments before he and his ex-wife Doria walked her across the sand to marry Trevor.Mr Markle also kept his business-class ticket to the four-day affair, along with an invitation, which featured a picture of a bikini-wearing Meghan on the beach entwined in Trevor’s arms, and a chilled bottle of Red Stripe beer within arm’s reach.The wedding took place at the famous Jamaica Inn, where Meghan booked all 55 rooms and villas, taking the £1,200-a-night largest villa for herself and her new husband.‘Meghan planned everything down to the tiniest detail. She took control of everything. I was given a white shirt to wear, as were all the male guests. She micro-managed everything,’ says Mr Markle.‘The picture was taken when I walked into her bungalow just moments before the ceremony was due to start. I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown, looking so beautiful. We took the picture and then Doria and I both walked her down the aisle.‘Trevor is Jewish and his father, who is a rabbi, conducted the service. But it was not a traditional Jewish ceremony. Meghan read vows she’d written herself.’          Prince Harry severely berated Mr Markle after he posed for photos before the royal wedding - contributing to their riftEach heartfelt word reveals the true sentiments of a devoted daughter. Meghan’s love for Thomas Markle is as plain as day.Yet today he is a pariah. At 74, in failing health in his twilight years, he is spending Christmas ostracised by his daughter. Heartbroken, cut off and cast out into the cold by an angry and indignant Meghan.The irony will be lost on the new Duchess of Sussex, as she fine-tunes her favoured philanthropic causes, that charity, as the saying goes, should begin at home. But to her, Thomas has become an embarrassment and a rolling public humiliation.Unable to manage and control him, she has pulled up the drawbridge. Behind the castle walls she will not – cannot – be reached. While Thomas feels wounded, Meghan feels betrayed. She is unwilling to climb down from the battlements. Meghan’s Royal ambition is leaving a large and untidy wake.She has in the past been accused of using people and then quickly moving on up the ladder, never looking back.It may be harsh to say she’s ‘ghosting’ her father – the fashionable term used when someone cuts off all communication without warning or explanation. Thomas prefers to describe her behaviour as ‘acting up’. But what’s certain is that she has approached her new Royal life at full tilt, head down, powering through.As Thomas says: ‘She was a control freak but never in a bad way – she was always sweet and kind.’Meghan’s marriage to Prince Harry wasn’t simply falling in love – although that was the main impetus – it was a life transformation of unimaginable proportions.A girl raised in a series of Los Angeles apartment blocks, who reinvented herself as a successful TV actress, is now reinventing herself as a princess.Since joining the House of Windsor her personal style has got more regal and refined. She has made sure social issues are front and centre of her public persona, like her high-profile cookbook launch to help Grenfell survivors with mum Doria in tow. And, of course, she plays the Royal wife with aplomb, as we have seen on the couple’s dazzling tour to Australia and New Zealand. She is, as one source says, ‘putting everything into this’. And as Thomas observes, his perfectionist daughter has always liked to micro-manage her life.Meghan knew her arrival in the Royal circle would be tricky. A orcee, a woman with history, there was always the chance of a disgruntled ex speaking out.What no one expected – and what has repeatedly wrong-footed Palace officials – is that it would be her immediate family who would prove to be the headache.While Doria has been the personification of discretion, Meghan views her father’s meandering outbursts during this critical time as a reminder of where she came from – not where she’s going. And right now, she finds it unforgivable. A post she shared on her old lifestyle blog The Tig gives a telling insight into how she deals with such ‘negative experiences’.She quoted Portuguese life coach José Micard Teixeira, who wrote: ‘I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me.’This philosophy still drives Meghan’s thinking and has been firmly applied to her father’s behaviour.From day one she has appeared to play favourites with her parents – Doria got an official Palace scroll announcing their wedding, Thomas didn’t. Doria was formally invited to the nuptials, Thomas wasn’t. And he was very hurt when told he couldn’t make a speech at the reception.In most family feuds, it takes a third party – a husband or partner – to intervene, break the entrenched positions and tactfully suggest the offer of an olive branch might be the best way forward.Harry should have been that peacemaker. But headstrong, unworldly and in thrall to his starry, beautiful wife he did nothing to calm the brewing storm.Rather than respectfully meeting his father-in-law face to face before the couple’s engagement was announced, he chose a quick chat on the phone. Harry – or rather his advisers – had the chance to bring Thomas into the Royal tent before the world even knew Meghan and Harry were a couple. It was a dropped ball that has led us to this point.When, only days before the wedding, Thomas foolishly agreed to stunt some photographs, Harry was on the phone again, this time to severely berate him. Thomas, recovering from urgent heart surgery and deeply embarrassed by his actions, pulled out of his daughter’s big day. Some Royal insiders suggested he faked the surgery to find an excuse, but, as we reveal today, it actually saved his life.For Meghan, the joy of her Windsor Castle wedding shared by the world was a chance to put all the unpleasantness behind her. She decided to take a ‘time out’ from her Dad, but neglected to communicate that to him properly. Once again, he felt hurt and slighted and reacted angrily in a live TV interview.Right now it’s hard to see Meghan giving ground. Just in practical terms she is heavily pregnant, working with interior designers and armed with swatch fabric and paint samples, to redevelop the couple’s new home, Frogmore Cottage, in time for the spring birth. She won’t be jumping on a plane to Mexico to make peace with her father in those circumstances. But with Thomas in ailing health, Harry needs to man up and fix what he inadvertently set off in the first place by failing to show Meghan’s father the necessary respect. Only then will Meghan and her father be reunited.Time is a great healer – but time is also something that we can never have enough of. Harry and Prince William spoke movingly last year of how they are haunted by their last hurried phone call to their mother, Princess Diana, the evening before she died.They were eager to get off the phone because they were having such a great time playing with their cousins at Balmoral. Harry said in an interview: ‘I can’t really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was.’It’s a sentiment we have all felt in one way or another. A visit we never made, a call not returned, and suddenly the chance to say what we wanted to say is gone for ever.Meghan is at heart a good and generous woman who is ambitious and could be critical in the reinvention of the Royal Family for another generation.But what she cannot be is forever cast as the cruelly unforgiving daughter of a heartbroken and lonely old man.And Harry holds the key to making sure that doesn’t happen – before it’s too late."},{"url":null,"title":"Masked Ted Baker boss grunted climbed female colleague","story":"    Ray Kelvin (pictured) is accused of climbing on top of a woman and grunting in the latest allegation to surface The founder of Ted Baker allegedly climbed on top of a female employee and moved his hands up and down her thigh while wearing a Halloween mask and grunting. Ray Kelvin, 62, is taking a \u0027voluntary leave of absence\u0027 after the latest harassment allegation to surface.An employee and two people who claim to have witnessed the incident, in which the chief executive is said to have straddled the woman.The woman, dubbed Woman X in The Sunday Times to preserve her anonymity, says Mr Kelvin donned a monster mask as he approached her desk in the open-plan office.\u0027He then climbed on top of me and straddled me,\u0027 she said. \u0027He was breathing in my ear, making sexual, grunting noises. He had his hand resting on my upper thigh and I had a dress on. He was moving his hand up and down.\u0027Woman X says that she covered her face with her hands as she waited for the alleged 30-second incident to end. She claims to have been assaulted in the fashion firm\u0027s head office in London when the workplace was quiet. Two former staff have backed up her claim, saying they were present when the alleged incident occurred.One said they were sat on the same bank of desks as Woman X when Mr Kelvin approached people to make grunting and groaning noises. He is then accused of approaching the victim and grunting into her neck.   The ex-employee said that the alleged victim was wearing a dress and that the fashion mogul grunted as he rubbed his hands up and down her thighs.A second former employee said Mr Kelvin - famous for refusing to reveal his face in photos - at first appeared to be innocently pranking people by scaring them with the mask.

The former staff member said: \u0027He was touching her legs, I think.\u0027 The three former workers believe that the alleged incident took place in October 2015.Woman X claims that she felt unable to raise the matter with human resources staff because she expected to be told: \u0027That\u0027s just Ray.\u0027 She claims that when she did mention the alleged incident during her exit interview she was told just that. It echoes claims from other former employees who say that they were worried raising alleged incidents would be met with the same response.           The former employee has alleged that the boss of Ted Baker climbed on top of her while wearing a Halloween monster mask and rubbing her legs A spokesperson for Ted Baker said yesterday that the investigation will consider all relevant matters which have been or are in the future reported to the company.The firm declined to comment on specific allegations until the investigation has been completed. More than 20 former staff both male and female have spoken out in the past 10 days. Allegations include one woman saying that Mr Kelvin asked her whether she faked orgasms, The Sun reported yesterday, and referred to her as his \u0027dolly bird\u0027.The woman said that when she went to human resources the head of department \u0027laughed it off\u0027.

The Ted Baker boss (pictured) is alleged to have harassed employees A total of 2,689 people signed the petition, whose creator alleged: \u0027I’ve seen the CEO ask young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears.\u0027A sign near Mr Kelvin\u0027s desk read \u0027hug here\u0027 until it was removed last week. Mr Kelvin opened his first Ted Baker store in Glasgow in 1988. The Sunday Times Rich List estimates him to be worth £522million. But his stake plummeted in value by £53million last week as the firm\u0027s shares hit a five-year low. The fashion boss, who named the company after his alter ego, said that the accusations had raised very serious and upsetting issues.He claimed to care deeply for his workforce. Last year he said: \u0027Ted has a hugging culture where everyone is treated with respect.\u0027Ted Baker initially defended Mr Kelvin\u0027s behaviour, saying that hugs are \u0027part of Ted Baker\u0027s culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon. On Wednesday he was accused of shoving an employee against a wall two years ago because he hadn\u0027t been invited to his wedding. The petition organisers say that they have received about 100 anonymous reports of harassment that it has passed to Ted Baker\u0027s board. A Ted Baker spokeswoman said the firm does \u0027not believe these reports are reflective of the organisation we have all worked hard to develop over the last 30 years\u0027.The firm said is was taking the allegations seriously and that the law firm investigating has no previous connections to the company.\u0027A further announcement will be made in due course regarding how current and former employees can raise matters for consideration in the investigation,\u0027 she said, adding: \u0027The Non-Executive Committee will carefully consider the content and recommendations of their report.\u0027An ex-employee said that the company\u0027s culture was leading many to leave and described the staff turnover as very high, comparing it to a five-a-side football team with roll-on roll-off subs. A dozen other workplace campaigns have been started on Organise, the site on which the Ted Baker petition was launched. Organise\u0027s chief executive, Nat Whalley, described the surge as staff teaming up to find their collective power after years of putting up with \u0027bad bosses\u0027.      Ray Kelvin allegations: ‘Grunting Ted Baker boss climbed on top of me in Halloween mask’ | News | The Sunday TimesFormer Ted Baker employee says Rae Kelvin called her his \u0027dolly bird\u0027, sat her on his knee and quizzed her about orgasms"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/15/15/515653E200000578-6277891-Invasive_procedures_designed_to_rid_homosexual_people_of_their_s-a-5_1539613240236.jpg","title":"Church England start inquiry called gay cure therapies","story":"UK pastor offering ‘cure’ for homosexuality likens gay...\u0027They attached electrodes to my genitals\u0027: Shocking details...Share this articleThe Government then launched a 75 point LGBT Action Plan costing £4.5million, and among other pledges, promised to outlaw the therapies. Its plan did not offer a definition or say how it was going to be outlawed, but noted the treatments included \u0027pseudo-psychological treatments to, in extreme cases, surgical interventions and \u0027corrective\u0027 rape\u0027.The plan also said faith organisations were most likely to carry out the treatments.Last year the Church of England\u0027s General Synod endorsed a motion saying the practice is \u0027unethical, potentially harmful and has no place in the modern world\u0027.The Church of England\u0027s Second Church Estates Commissioner, Dame Caroline Spelman, also met with ministers to consider outlawing the therapies.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Hundreds teachers struggle spelling maths knowledge curriculum","story":"Analysis of Ofsted ratings shows teachers make many mistakes during lessons.

Crucially, they took a calculated risk that they would get planning permission to build on the plot included.\u0027Instantly we saw the opportunity there to build something on it. Our initial idea was to build and then sell that something outright, which would then have paid off the mortgage on the house we\u0027d just purchased.\u0027 However, they spotted an eco-home while out on a bike ride which inspired them to be more bold and ambitious with their extra land. \u0027After buying the house our idea quite quickly evolved into building something more daring and to create our dream home from the ground up.\u0027           Next step: \u0027We put in planning permission proposal in 2009. We were confident we would get it as there had been houses on the site before and Sheffield Planning - a very forward thinking group gave us approval and we were able to begin\u0027 said Mr Hunt. Construction started in January 2010, the pair were moved in by July and the project finished by October. The build cost was £138,000, with £7,000 architect fees and a further £5,000 engineers fees, amounting to about £150,000  Moving again: After five years of living in the eco-home, the pair decided they were ready for a family and decided to move back to Shropshire to be nearer to their parents. \u0027For a year or two we had been keeping an eye out for properties and then we saw the Coach House. The idea was to move back, renovate the barns and open a holiday cottage business from the property\u0027          Mr Hunt said: \u0027Our requirements were quite particular really because we wanted somewhere where we could live onsite so we could oversee everything and manage it, while also having some separation from the business for our own lives\u0027. The Coach House appeared set-up beautifully for the next stage of their journey and so the Hunts, who had been careful with their savings over the past five years, decided they were ready to take the plunge          Moving up the property ladder: The pair were ready for a family and decided to move back to Shropshire to be nearer to their parents. Having started with five percent mortgages, spotting planning potential on a larger home and clubbing together to make the project a reality, the Hunts were in a very strong position once they eventually sold upThe plan became about building an eco-home on the space, moving in there and then switching the mortgage on the current property to buy-to-let instead - meaning it would start paying for itself. \u0027We popped a note through the letterbox and asked who did your house?\u0027 Mr Hunt said.\u0027They put us in touch with Halliday Clark, a Yorkshire Architect firm who then designed what would become affectionately known as Hunt House.To fund the build, Mr Hunt sold his bachelors pad, clearing £30,000. While Mrs Hunt, a government economist, had £65,000 equity from her house that she could contribute. The pair were also careful with savings and took out a £40,000 loan as a top up.\u0027In 2009, we put in a planning permission proposal and were confident we\u0027d get it as there had been houses on the site before. Sheffield Planning - a very forward thinking group - gave us approval and we were able to begin.\u0027          Inside the Coach House cottages: The Coach House cost the pair £135,000 which was just the buildings cost and the bit of land that came with it. The sale of the eco-friendly \u0027Hunt House\u0027 realised a £150,000 profit which was used to buy their dream family home the \u0027Coach House\u0027 - they paid £35,000 below the market price because they were able to offer cash up front          Inside the Coach House kitchen: \u0027We offered £125,000 cheekily but we eventually increased it to £135,000 which was still a fantastic deal because we were able to pay in cash after doing so well on the \u0027Hunt House\u0027. The renovation cost of Coach House we footed with the savings we\u0027d made in the interim along from our works along with cash from the sale\u0027 said Mr HuntConstruction started in January 2010, the pair were moved in by July and the project finished by October. The build cost was £138,000, with £7,000 architect fees and a further £5,000 engineers fees, amounting to about £150,000. \u0027By each of us selling our properties, which we had secured through five percent mortgages, we were able to collectively fund this project and move in!\u0027 What followed was a blissful time spent in the stunning eco-home, where they remained diligent in the savings made from life without a mortgage and almost zero utility bill costs. After five years of living in \u0027Hunt House\u0027 the pair decided they were ready to start a family and decided to move to Shropshire to be nearer to their parents.\u0027For a year or two we had been keeping an eye out for properties and then we saw the Coach House.

So if you\u0027ve seen the original movie, you\u0027ll know what comes next.For the first film, the action was set in Edwardian London in 1910. For the sequel, it takes place in the capital in 1934.Mary is called back to help her former charge Michael Banks, now a father-of-three, played by Ben Whishaw, who is despondent over the death of his wife and money problems which means he risks losing their home.Also helping to care for his children is his sister Jane, played by Emily Mortimer, who takes after her campaigning suffragette mother by becoming a union activist.When Michael dumps his old kite in the bin, it is picked up by his youngest son Georgie, who flies it the park nearby — only to bring it down to earth with Mary Poppins attached.For Mary\u0027s grand re-entrance, costume designer Sandy Powell says it was essential that the character\u0027s new reincarnation cut a recognisable silhouette.\u0027You\u0027re trying to do another version of an iconic look. And, in a way, her character can\u0027t change too much as she\u0027s always the same person like Peter Pan or James Bond.\u0027To bring her up to date, Mary\u0027s skirt has a shorter hemline, she wears a double cape made of cobalt blue and carries a carpet bag with a Thirties Art Deco design.Sandy says: \u0027Traditionally, a nanny\u0027s coat would have been navy blue, but I wanted Mary to add brightness to a dark, grey world\u0027.Despite her dainty landing, Emily Blunt admitted she was terrified while filming the arrival scene because of her fear of heights.Emily says: \u0027I was 50ft in the air and so scared. As I landed, one of the camera guys came up and said: \u0027I got really choked watching you arrive there.\u0027\u0027It reminded me people really need a film and a moment like this. Maybe we didn\u0027t realise how much we wanted Mary to come back.\u0027WHY JULIE TURNED DOWN £1 MILLION TO APPEAR          When Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than study the original film again she read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books insteadWhen Surrey-born Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than studying the original film again — which she hadn\u0027t seen since she was a child — Blunt read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books instead.Emily, 35, says: \u0027I decided not to be intimidated by Julie Andrews in the iconic role, and just approached it as I would any other part. No one is going to out-do Julie Andrews.\u0027Blunt found a different side to the nanny in the books, written in Thirties and Forties — \u0027a little more acerbic and vain and weird\u0027.Indeed it\u0027s a portrait the Australian-born Travers would probably have preferred, having loathed the saccharine portrayal of her creation in the first film.Emily was the only actress approached to reprise the role made famous by Sound Of Music Star Julie Andrews, now 83.And, despite a rumoured offer of over £1 million to make a cameo, Julie Andrews turned down the invitation.Director Rob Marshall says: \u0027Julie was incredibly gracious, but she made it clear right up front.\u0027She said: \u0027I really want it to be Emily\u0027s show. I really want her to take this and run with it, because she will be brilliant.\u0027 \u0027However only two members of the original onscreen Banks family survive — Glynis Johns, who is now 95, who played Mrs Banks, and Karen Dotrice, now 63, was her daughter Jane.David Tomlinson, who was strict father George Banks in the original, died in 2000 aged 83, while Matthew Garber who played his mischievous son Michael died age 21 in 1977 after catching hepatitis during a trip to India.THE MOST FAMOUS ADDRESS IN CHILDREN\u0027S BOOKS          In the original, Dick Van Dyke played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks. Now the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s sonAmerican actor Dick Van Dyke\u0027s cockney accent as a London chimney sweep has gone down in film history for all the wrong reasons.Indeed, the actor himself has branded it the worst ever, claiming that his vocal coach was Irish and didn\u0027t know how to do one himself.          Van Dyke spent two days on set often bringing cast members like Emily Blunt to tears by singing snippets of the original songsDick, now 92, says: \u0027People in the UK love to rib me about that accent. They ask what part of England I was meant to be from and I say it was a little shire in the North where most of the people were from Ohio.\u0027In the original, Van Dyke also played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks.Now that\u0027s he\u0027s hung up his chimney brush, the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s son, who would now be the same age — so this time Van Dyke needed no make-up to age him.Van Dyke spent two days on the set of the film, often bringing cast members like Emily Blunt to tears by singing snippets of the original songs.FROM CHIMNEY SWEEP TO LAMPLIGHTER          Meryl Streep joins the new cast as cousin Topsy Tartlet. She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a TuesdayIn the original film, Mary\u0027s only relative was Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who laughs so much he floats on the ceiling.For this outing, she is joined by her cousin, Topsy Tartlet, played by Meryl Streep.She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a Tuesday.As a result, the Oscar-winning actress performs her song Turning Turtle upside down from a chandelier.Designers say her shop was the most challenging of the 50 sets to build.Topsy\u0027s costume — inspired by Bohemian poet Edith Sitwell — was also the hardest to make and based on a pair of Twenties vintage pyjamas and a kimono.For three weeks, a team of ten textile artists bleached the material before hand-painting it with Art Deco patterns of orange, pink, turquoise and yellow.To complete the look, Streep asked for a vibrant orange wig cut into bob which was topped off with a green turban and curtain tassles for earrings.THE BATH THAT BECOMES AN UNDERWATER ADVENTURE          Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) go on a series of adventures in the filmJust as they did in the first film, Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) — embark on a series of Technicolor-style fantasy adventures.One of the most beloved in the first film was when the characters jumped into Bert\u0027s chalk pavement pictures to discover a magical world where they interact with cartoon characters.And rather than use computer-generated images, the makers returned to traditional hand-drawn animation, a technique not employed in a Disney movie for nearly ten years.However in other parts of the film, computer animation is used when a dolphin beckons the children into the bath tub — and leads them to an underwater fantasia.The mix of special effects and live action meant that, although the live filming only took four months, Mary Poppins Returns spent more than a year in post-production, as long as a science fiction movie.RETURN TO A VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL          In one scene in which the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside itWhen the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside it.She spins the bowl around, creating a whirlwind that transports them within.Once there, Mary Poppins picks up her umbrella, and turns it to create a tent which turns into a Victorian music hall where Jack and Mary put on a show — with dozens of dressed-up cartoon animals in the audience.Hollywood film star and cricket hero are named among 35...Share this articleTo help the character fit with the animated creations, costume designer Sandy Powell says they wanted to make the humans\u0027 clothing look two-dimensional, as if had also been drawn by the animators.The outfits were then made out of canvas-like material which was hand-painted with details like collars, buttons and bows.Sandy Powell says: \u0027I wanted the effect on all of these costumes to look like watercolour on paper with the white coming through.\u0027THE RETURN OF THE PENGUINS          In the new movie the dapper bow-tied  penguins return once more. At the time of the original movie it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animationThe scene where Dick Van Dyke as Bert performs a tap dance with a group of four bow-tied penguin waiters was one of the most beloved from the original movie.At the time it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animation — shot against a bright yellow, rather than green, screen — which was so hard on the eyes that the actor reported he couldn\u0027t see by the end of the day.Now the dapper penguins have returned once more — named after Hollywood legends, (Fred) Astaire, (Oliver) Hardy, (Cary) Grant and (Charlie) Chaplin — to perform a music hall number with Mary and Jack.As well as some of the favourites from the original movie, the film also features nine new songs written by the same team who wrote the musical Hairspray, but which are intended to sound as if they could have been written in 1964.Although she has to match the legendary singing voice of Julie Andrews, Emily Blunt also has no problem holding a musical note.Before she became an actress, she was considering career as singer until she was spotted in a school production performing at the Edinburgh Festival.A LOVE LETTER TO LONDON          The film include\u0027s so many of London\u0027s landmarks- from areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham PalaceThe film has been called a \u0027love letter to London\u0027, because it includes so many of the city\u0027s landmarks.Areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham Palace were taken over during night shoots by hundreds of extras on vintage bikes and buses borrowed from the London Transport Museum.To add to the atmosphere, mist was used to look like a pre-war fog.However, actor Lin-Manuel Miranda said using the iconic locations piled on the pressure to get the scenes right first time: \u0027The adrenaline was pumping. You\u0027re never coming back to Buckingham Palace to get a second take.\u0027Throughout the film, the set is built on many levels to show as many dancers as possible during the musical numbers.To perfect the scenes, the actors and dancers rehearsed for eight weeks to get every move perfect — even though in some scenes they had to interact with cartoon partners who were not added until after.Miranda says they had to work with instructions such as: \u0027The penguin is going to be heavier holding on to your cane. Can you show us that?\u0027In order to recreate a scene with Big Ben for the climax, the filmmakers built a giant recreation of the clock face in a studio — all to scale, after making set visits to Westminster to see how it worked close-up.Production designer John Myhre says: \u0027The clock face and sections of the tower are completely authentic and an exact reproduction of what is behind the clock face. It\u0027s a little bit of movie magic.\u0027 Mary Poppins Returns is released in the UK on Friday, December 21."},{"url":null,"title":"Jay Zs scholarship fund barely gives students money pay books","story":"Florida mom flying American Airlines with baby to hospital...Share this article    Jay-Z and wife Beyonce ended up dishing out a further 10 scholarships of $100,000 each during their On The Road II tour\u0027The foundation\u0027s goal is to reach as many students as possible.

The PM\u0027s de facto deputy David Lidington, and Justice Secretary, David Gauke, have been in talks with Labour MPs over the two possibilities.Sir Alan claimed his Tory colleagues lining up to oppose Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal had not \u0027thought strategically enough about what the consequences of that would be\u0027.\u0027The first is that even if they overturn it they are not necessarily going to get an alternative which they are campaigning for, and instead what they will probably do is set in train a course of events which could lead to chaos in many, many areas,\u0027 he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.He warned there could be a leadership contest, or a general election, and said the UK could be \u0027top dog in Europe at the moment when France is burning and Germany is in transition\u0027 but instead \u0027we\u0027re just beating ourselves up\u0027.Sir Alan also said Tory former foreign secretary Boris Johnson would be \u0027met with a very, very loud raspberry in many, many different languages\u0027 if he walked into a negotiating room in Brussels.And he warned: \u0027Let\u0027s be absolutely clear that if this goes pear-shaped in the way that it really could on the back of people opposing the deal that is on offer tomorrow night, the wreckers in history will forever be known as the wreckers.\u0027Under a barrage of attacks from all sides, the PM mounted a fresh fightback today by warning Eurosceptics that risk losing Brexit altogether unless they back her.She used a powerful interview in the Mail on Sunday yesterday to try to avert the rebellion by \u0027weaponising\u0027 the prospect of Mr Corbyn becoming Prime Minister.  Mrs May said Britain \u0027would truly be in uncharted waters\u0027 if the deal is voted down.She said: \u0027It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit. \u0027We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a General Election, no matter what the cost to the country… I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.\u0027Grace Millane\u0027s father is seen near courtroom in AucklandSiberian socialite Khristina Sysoeva reminiscing about her holidayBody found in search for British tourist in New Zealand\u0027Take the deal and get out\u0027: says James Cleverly during debateNZ PM apologises on behalf of country over the murder of backpackerJack Fincham hits out at Dani Dyer and says he\u0027s the reason they wonMet Office forecasts more sunshine as the cold weather hitsSteve Barclay confirms Brexit vote will take place on TuesdayTommy Robinson joins Brexit march as counter protests take placeBoris Johnson says he \u0027feels personally responsible\u0027 for BrexitAmber Rudd backs Theresa May ahead of Brexit agreement voteShe told her MPs: \u0027If you want Brexit, make sure you get it, and that\u0027s about this deal.\u0027 Ahead of one of the most momentous weeks in post-war British politics:Mrs May was considering making an emergency dash to Brussels to secure new legally binding assurances over the controversial backstop – as the EU hatched secret plans to delay Brexit by six weeksTory Brexit ringleader Jacob Rees-Mogg backed a BrexitRemain \u0027unity\u0027 ticket of Boris Johnson and Amber Rudd if Mrs May fallsMPs claimed that Home Secretary Sajid Javid was openly canvassing support for a leadership bid, while former Brexit Secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab were \u0027jostling for position with each other\u0027Leaked polling from Tory HQ revealed that 57 per cent of Conservative voters think MPs should vote for the deal, with just 27 per cent saying they should vote againstIt was claimed that, if Mrs May was forced out after the vote on Tuesday, then the Commons would have to sit at Christmas for the first time since the 17th Century Cromwellian interregnumLabour MPs piled pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to honour party policy on a second referendumIt was revealed Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was reduced to tears over the turmoilNigel Farage is poised to launch a new Leave party to exploit Conservative isions and push for a harder Brexit.Tory MPs are in open revolt over Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal, and Mrs May is expected to face a fresh attempt to oust her as Tory leader is she loses the big vote by a massive margin.Currently some 110 Tory MPs and the 10 DUP MPs propping the Tories up in power have refused to back her. If they stick to their guns then the PM is set for a catastrophic and humiliating defeat.Her mutinous Tories are furious at her deal\u0027s Irish backstop plan, which would see the UK tied to the customs union and more single market checks have to be carried out in Northern Ireland.They warn the UK cannot pull out of the backstop without the EU\u0027s permission - potentially keeping the UK \u0027locked\u0027 to Brussels against its will.Mr Johnson launched a fresh broadside against the deal as he laid out his pitch for the Brexit negotiations in what will be seen as a thinly veiled leadership pitch.Writing in The Sun, he said the UK should refuse to hand over half of the £39billion orce bill until a free trade is done. Mr Johnson has become the PM\u0027s fiercest critic since quitting as Foreign Secretary in fury at her Brexit plan.He wrote: \u0027It is time now to show our EU friends that we mean business. This should be a take-it-or-leave-it offer. \u0027And, to show that we mean  business, we must be able to walk away. \u0027This is a great country, capable of rising to immense challenges — and I believe the people of this country are fed up to the back teeth of being told by their Government that they are simply incapable of managing the logistical problems of Brexit.\u0027 Amid mounting opposition to the deal, civil servants have war-gamed two versions of the UK holding another referendum.The first is a straight choice between the PM\u0027s deal and remaining in the EU, and the second would be a leave, remain contest with a  second question asking them if they prefer the existing deal or a no-deal departure on World Trade Organisation terms, The Sunday Times reported.While Mrs May is facing overwhelming opposition from MPs, polling obtained by the Mail on Sunday found that Conservative voters in Tory-held seats want their MPs to vote for the deal by a majority of more than two to one.This suggests that MPs who voted against the deal could be punished at the ballot box at the next Election. If Mrs May loses an immediate no-confidence vote on Tuesday, Parliament could have to sit on Christmas Day because the Fixed Term Parliament Act sets a deadline of 14 calendar days for a new Government to be formed, meaning December 25 would be the last chance for any coalition to try to win a Commons majority. It\u0027s believed that the last time the Commons sat on Christmas Day was in 1656.          If these are Theresa May\u0027s final days in Downing Street, she seems remarkably sanguine about it, drinking from a mug which says \u0027proud to be a Bloody Difficult Woman\u0027 and using a hole punch which read \u0027please do not remove from office\u0027 Grace Millane\u0027s father is seen near courtroom in AucklandSiberian socialite Khristina Sysoeva reminiscing about her holidayBody found in search for British tourist in New Zealand\u0027Take the deal and get out\u0027: says James Cleverly during debateNZ PM apologises on behalf of country over the murder of backpackerJack Fincham hits out at Dani Dyer and says he\u0027s the reason they wonMet Office forecasts more sunshine as the cold weather hitsSteve Barclay confirms Brexit vote will take place on TuesdayTommy Robinson joins Brexit march as counter protests take placeBoris Johnson says he \u0027feels personally responsible\u0027 for BrexitAmber Rudd backs Theresa May ahead of Brexit agreement voteLabour MPs are privately urging Mr Corbyn to table a no-confidence motion against Mrs May if she loses the vote on her deal in the hope that it leads to a second referendum.Asked whether Labour would push for a no-confidence vote, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told The Mail on Sunday: \u0027We\u0027ll judge when we see what happens on Tuesday.\u0027Mr Rees-Mogg said dodging a vote on her Brexit deal would be as damaging to Mrs May as losing it. He said: \u0027The humiliation of avoiding a vote is as much a reason for her departure as defeat. It is her policy which has failed and for which she is accountable.\u0027And it would be much better if she left of her own accord rather than face a no-confidence motion.\u0027Mrs May\u0027s allies argue that, if the deal crashes, it will not only lead to the end of her leadership but the suspension of Article 50, the triggering of an election likely to lead to a Labour-SNP coalition Government, then a second referendum to try to reverse Brexit.Mrs May, who refuses to say whether she will resign if she loses the vote on her Brexit deal, rules out a second referendum while she is leader, telling this newspaper: \u0027We had a people\u0027s vote. Let\u0027s deliver on the first people\u0027s vote.\u0027The PM has been on a PR blitz to depserately try to drum up suport for her hugely controversial deal.But while she has been trying to appeal to the nation, opposition to her deal is mounting in Parliament - where the crucial decision will be made."},{"url":null,"title":"David Beckham wannabe spent 33 000 trying look like hero","story":"Jack Johnson, 22, of Kimberley, Nottinghamshire, spent 24 hours in a coma being treated for smoke inhalation after his one-bedroom flat went up in flamesThe incident happened on Thursday, November 8, and has left Jack, who is currently unemployed, having to sofa surf between friends and family.Mr Johnson, who calls himself Jack Beckham online, had decided to fry some potato waffles in a chip pan but dozed off while looking on social media.Meet the dumpster-ing granny: Frugal grandmother, 63, has...How to complete ALL your Christmas shopping in 30 minutes:...Share this articleHe woke to find his flat covered in smoke, with flames spreading from the kitchen to the bathroom and landing.

It appeared on the front page of the  on the last day of that month, referencing a long cold snap in New York City that ran beyond John F Kennedy’s inauguration the following January.Libbert took the photo at the very end of a four-month trip across the country, starting in Oregon, accompanying the celebrated  journalist WJ Weatherby. The photographer was 22 years old. He stayed in the Chelsea Hotel for $5 a night and walked the streets most of the day, up to Harlem and back to Greenwich Village, enthralled by what he saw.The Wollman ice rink in Central Park opened in 1949, and during the autumn and winter months remains a much-loved New York destination for skaters – though the Gotham City backdrop that Libbert captured has partly given way to the glass and steel monster apartment blocks of West 59th street.Of all the thousands of wonderful photographs that Libbert has had published in the  and the Observer in the 58 years since, this one, he suggests, remains a perennial favourite. At a recent show of his work at the Michael Hoppen gallery in New York, prints were snapped up by American collectors.

He thinks the world has forgotten what human rights mean, which is why he has designed a new flag The wallpaper image on Ai Weiwei’s mobile phone is a black and white photograph showing the entrance to an underground home in Xinjiang. It was here where the Chinese activist artist and his family were exiled for five years when he was a boy. “We were put underground here as a punishment,” he says. “This is where I grew up. Now they put the Uighurs in these kind of camps.” He enlarges the picture showing a bunker-like structure jutting out of the ground in an arid, inhospitable landscape.Ai’s father, Ai Qing, was a poet and political radical who, although no activist, was seen as a threat to society. “So I’ve always been involved with human rights issues, not initially out of choice but out of personal experience,” he says.Many of Ai’s works over a career ning more than 40 years have been investigations into human rights transgressions, including his own imprisonment by Chinese authorities. But now he has taken his interest a step further by accepting the invitation from UK arts organisations and human rights charities to design a flag to mark the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.“I don’t recall any kind of symbol for human rights,” he says, sitting at a long wooden table in his studio in Berlin, where he has lived in exile since 2015. “So it was time we gave it one.”He lays out a series of photographs. They show the muddy footprints of Rohingya refugees who have been forced to flee attacks by Myanmarese soldiers and take refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh.“These are the footprints of some of the barefooted children, women and young people who we met, who had no shoes,” he says. “Of course it’s very difficult to design something to illustrate such a large, abstract concept. But I thought a footprint relates to everybody who has been forced to flee, whether in Africa, Afghanistan or Bangladesh. There is nothing more human than a footprint.”The mud-prints have morphed into several versions of a blue footprint on a white background, which form the basis of Ai’s flag. The design is set to be released on 10 December, and UK schools, police forces, faith groups and hospitals will be invited to fly it from their buildings during a seven-day campaign in June.Ai believes that the effects of globalisation have eroded a common understanding of human rights. “Less and less people now talk about human rights since the end of the cold war. They use words like common values instead, so as not to offend the Chinese authorities with whom they want to do business. Increasingly, people are even viewing human rights in a negative way.”“People in Britain and elsewhere in the better-off world fail to grasp that the way they live can affect the way people elsewhere in the world live,” he continues. “iPhones are made in China because that country joined the capitalism game and plays it very well. But those who make the phones have no basic rights and are modern slaves who end up jumping out of factory windows. People who buy the phones have to have more of a sense of responsibility and engagement.”Ai took his nine-year-old son with him on a recent trip to Bangladesh – about which he is making a film – just as he has to other investigations, such as to Mexico, to investigate the 43 students who disappeared in a single day in 2014.“He’s been with me to visit most refugee camps I’ve been to, as well as the poorest ghettos in Mexico, and cartel areas, the island of Lesbos in Greece. I don’t want to teach him anything, but by being exposed to this kind of information he has developed a basic sensitivity of what’s right or wrong. And he sees me arguing a lot with people.”That morning, the argument was with a Berlin taxi driver on the way to taking his son to school, who told Ai to shut off his mobile phone – he was listening to a message from his mother – because it interfered with the music he was playing on his radio. “He told me to get out of the car, and when I said I wouldn’t he slammed on the brakes and we all fell forward. My son hit his head. He used his vehicle on a public street to express his anger”.“So you see I am fighting battles wherever I go – including with German people who say I should be grateful to them because I am a refugee, and they paid for my life. This is the mood in Germany right now, the posters I see in the streets saying: ‘We can make our own babies, we don’t need foreigners.’ It’s the mood in much of Europe, including the UK. It’s very scary because this kind of moment is a reflection of the 1930s.”He is angry and confused about experiencing this sort of hostility in Germany, the country that gave him refuge. He took the first available opportunity to thank its chancellor, Angela Merkel, for her involvement in his release.“I met her by chance in the Chinese restaurant I go to, which is very close to her flat and where we’ve seen each other several times since. I shook her hand and as it was my birthday she congratulated me. I thanked her for all the effort her government made to bring me out. They were really very supportive.”Ai’s 4,000m2 studio is 46 steps, or 10 metres, below ground in a former brewery in the north of Berlin. The decision to be subterranean is a very deliberate one, he says. “In my New York studio, I’m also underground. I feel like I have special protection. I have spent years being discriminated against, under surveillance, followed by people undercover, which makes you feel you’re not part of society and you need your own corner. Having once been a way of suppressing my family, being underground has become something positive to me. I need the solitude to work. I need to be separated. It’s a form of self-protection.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/539f4daffc8f766cc40b5533a81bc39bc28298ca/0_605_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca8b8572fb9d33ff010437cfe65020fc","title":"portraits of the artist as wallpaper in pictures","story":"In her elaborate self-portraits, Cecilia Paredes hides within colourful, patterned fabrics.

Uncertainty among consumers, with the Brexit process reaching a crunch point, comes at a time when retailers are already struggling to adjust to the move from physical shops to online.The hedge fund run by Odey, one of the most outspoken of the Brexit-backing hedge fund managers, holds a short position in Intu – the owner of shopping malls including the Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester – that represented £33m worth of shares in the company at the end of last week. He also holds a position against struggling department store Debenhams that is worth £5.3m. The firm also appears to be betting that Britons’ appetite for cars will fall, in line with surveys showing hesitation over big-ticket purchases. The firm has short positions against Lookers, a large dealership chain, and Auto Trader, the online used-car directory.In total, his hedge fund, with headquarters in Mayfair, has taken out £436m worth of declared short positions against British companies, of which nearly £150m are consumer-facing entities.At the same time, Marshall Wace, one of the UK’s largest hedge funds with $35bn (£27bn) in assets under management, holds declarable short positions equivalent to just under £1.4bn – more than any other investor in Britain.Marshall Wace has 47 declared short positions in UK firms, the highest concentration of any European country, according to Breakout Point, an investment data firm.Marshall Wace has also bulked up its Dublin operations, where it has received fund management licences, as a protection against the risk of being prevented from servicing EU clients after Brexit.Investors are not required to publicly report their short positions on currencies or bonds, but Brexit has also provided the opportunity to profit from falls in the value of the pound and lower demand for British government debt.In August Odey, who made an estimated £220m overnight in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, said he was betting against sterling to fall as far as $1.21 against the US dollar. So far the pound’s low point this year was just below $1.27. Odey also had short positions on UK government bonds, he told Reuters recently.Other leave campaign donors have taken more political approaches since the vote.Jeremy Hosking, one of the co-founders of the Marathon hedge fund who now runs Hosking Partners, invests in company stocks around the world. Hosking donated more than £1.5m to Brexit-related organisations, including Vote Leave.Before the 2017 general election Hosking pledged to fund a campaign to unseat pro-remain MPs. At the time he said he wanted an “army” of Brexit-backing MPs to support the prime minister, Theresa May. However, Hosking indicated he preferred a “full, national Brexit”, rather than a “City of London Brexit”. His former colleagues in Marathon – in which Hosking still holds a financial interest – appeared to be less pleased with the Brexit vote.

I think a number of retailers will be really pinched in the new year. Fashion and department stores are particularly vulnerable.”The dire predictions come after Primark sent a shiver through the sector last week by warning of “challenging” trading conditions, with Brexit jitters threatening the busiest shopping weeks of the year.Sales at the UK’s third-largest clothing retailer – behind Next and the market leader M\u0026ampS – have been bucking the high-street gloom, but Primark warned of subdued sales for November as fewer shoppers visited its stores.Nick Bubb, a retail industry analyst, said the update would “strike fear” into fashion retailers’ hearts because Primark is viewed as one of the sector’s more resilient names.The troubled business Ted Baker also reported disappointing figures last week, while John Lewis said sales had slumped after record takings during the week of Black Friday.The subdued figures reflect the cautious mood on the high street.The news also comes after prices in British shops rose for only the third time in five years in November, pushed up in part by higher global costs for commodities such as wheat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb459377058d751f6a477382206cbe51c8b4ae96/0_314_1320_792/master/1320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f483aa46aa0f078034db5944b686de6e","title":"the anxious art of liana finck people who dont live in cities think im being so mean","story":"As part of our new series, the illustrated city, artist Liana Finck explains why she thinks urban living makes people so angry – and how drawing on the subway gave her her trademark styleHuman beings: can’t live with them, can’t live without them. Nowhere is this truer than in cities where, increasingly, we live on top of each other in ever-denser spaces and no one captures the resultant moments of friction better than Liana Finck. The New Yorker cartoonist has accumulated a loyal following for her line drawings conveying – in unpretentious, quivering pen strokes – all the micro-aggressions and anxieties that navigating a city provokes.In fact, she says by phone from New York, her trademark style – that can just as effectively convey apprehension or bristling anger – is derived from drawing on the subway. “That’s where my signature wiggly lines come from. A subway helps me not fake them.”While her new graphic memoir, Passing for Human, centres on family, the single panel vignettes she posts on Instagram reflect her observations of urban life and how its etiquette is breached or upheld. “I think it inspires my Instagram drawings because I use those mostly to figure out things that are bothering me and make sense of them. I know that every city must have a different flavour of micro-aggression, but I have a feeling that New York must be worse than others.”Finck’s keen observation of human behaviour reflects acute awareness – to the point of self-consciousness – of her own. She regularly draws in cafes, not out of necessity but because the quiet of her studio is not conducive to work. It is clearly a rich seam of complicated feelings for her. “I feel a lot of shame about it, I don’t know why. I feel like it’s rude to spend longer than a couple of hours in a cafe. I feel bad when baristas start recognising me, like some weird eccentric.“The point is to get your coffee, give them your business, and then get out and let someone else buy something. I hate when there’s not enough tables and there’s people quietly fighting for them.”Many of the misbehaviours (she calls them “micro-unkindnesses”) that catch her attention are fleeting and, some might say, inconsequential – like someone intruding on your space in a packed elevator or the “pedestrian rage” directed at slow walkers. Somewhat ironically, it’s those drawings that draw the most negative response on Instagram. “People who don’t live in cities think I’m being so mean,” she says.“I guess it’s the same thing they don’t like in Larry David – like, ‘why am I being so needlessly mean spirited’? It seems like I’m nitpicking, like I’m choosing this tiny thing that annoys me and blowing this thing out of proportion instead of seeing the bigger picture.”But Finck frames it as “noticing how civilisation works” – moments when the urban fabric is momentarily pulled taut. If you do not pay these trivial transgressions any mind, it may be because city living fosters – maybe demands – a certain obliviousness, a thicker skin. But not everyone develops it.“Sometimes I feel like a person who notices these things in a world of blind people who don’t,” says Finck, the sound of car horns faintly audible in the background. “We’re just putting away our bodies, packing them in the most efficient way possible, while our minds can go anywhere.”If you’re an illustrator or graphic artist with an idea for the illustrated city series, email us at cities@theFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d69a485457722d7a8bb846e7bda907813ddc8659/115_0_4144_2486/master/4144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5ba03c4902b3577d7e1af4a099284d0","title":"angela merkel annegret kramp karrenbauer germany eu","story":"So Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer – AKK, as her fans call her – is the new leader of the CDU. After her narrow victory over her rival Friedrich Merz, the tabloid Bild ran the headline: “Kramp-Karren-Power!” However, the woman who demonstrated her enduring power at the CDU party congress on Friday was not AKK, but Angela Merkel. AKK was Merkel’s choice. For the first time in postwar German history, a national leader has managed her own succession.Konrad Adenauer and Willy Brandt were forced out by cabals. The interim figures Ludwig Erhard and Kurt Georg Kiesinger never had a chance to make their mark. Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schröder went down to defeat in elections before being disgraced – Kohl by a party-financing scandal, Schröder by taking a job with Gazprom.Merkel declared that she would not seek another term when her chancellorship expires in 2021, and then took a gamble by stepping down as party leader and indicating that Kramp-Karrenbauer, whom she had installed as secretary general, would be her preferred successor. If the party wanted to break with Merkel’s legacy of modernisation, of making the CDU electable for urban elites, modern women and minorities, even at the expense of alienating more conservative voters, now was the time to do it.Some disgruntled grandees decided to grab the opportunity. Ex-finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who had once been touted as Kohl’s successor, but who had been blindsided by Merkel, persuaded Merz to run. Merz had been ousted as leader of the party’s parliamentary faction by Merkel in the early 2000s and had spent the intervening years amassing business experience and oodles of money with the asset-management firm Black Rock. He was supported by another male victim of Merkel’s manoeuvres, Günther Oettinger. Every bit as ambitious as Schäuble and Merz, Oettinger had been shunted off to a commissioner’s post in Brussels for his pains.Merz, then, embodied the hope – or the threat – of a return to the CDU of the Kohl era: a shift to the right in the hope of reclaiming voters who had abandoned the CDU for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). He immediately became the darling of the right-of-centre media and the pro-business groups in the CDU. AKK, on the other hand, was the candidate of the party’s women’s and youth organisations. Women and youth versus business, the sympathetic media and the patriarchs: this would have been a no-brainer before Merkel.Had Merz won, the pundits would now be asking how long he would need to topple Merkel. Now they are asking how long AKK will be able to keep Merkel in power. The weak point in Merkel’s coalition is the Social Democratic party (SPD), in freefall at the polls and gazing enviously at Jeremy Corbyn’s resurgent, back-to-the-70s Labour party and anxiously at the once-powerful, now marginalised French Socialist party. The SPD might jump ship at any time, and AKK might be the one to push them, in spite of herself. She told the party before her election that the days when “we executed the policies of the government” were over and that the CDU would expect the government to follow the party line.So what could one expect from AKK as leader of Germany? Though loyal to Merkel, she’s no Merkel clone. Merkel is a Protestant from the East. AKK is a Catholic from the Saarland, wedged between France and Germany. Merkel is devoid of convictions, AKK a conservative and European. Merkel came in at the top as a token East German woman after unification AKK slogged her way up through the ranks in the CDU’s youth and women’s organisations, fought successful elections and led governments at local and state levels – and understands what makes the party tick. Nobody doubts her capabilities. If she gets a chance, she would be a decisive – and vocal – leader of Germany and Europe and less prone to silent procrastination than Merkel.AKK’s European options are, of course, limited by the state of the Union. Having (almost certainly) lost Britain to Brexit, Germany now seems to be losing France to the gilets jaunes. Italy, Hungary, Poland and other eastern European states are in rebellion against Brussels. Some hope that Merkel will use her new-found freedom to attempt some grand European balancing act. But with all the European heavyweights except Germany paralysed by populism, Merkel will probably revert to form and leave AKK the job of sorting out the mess.If anyone can do it, she can. As a Catholic from a small German state, she understands subsidiarity and the resentments of smaller countries within the EU in a way Merkel the Prussian never could. As an instinctive European, she will go the extra mile to preserve the Union. Who knows, she might even find a way to entice Britain back in.• Alan Posener, a German blogger, writes for Die Welt and Welt am Sonntag"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2345ee763d5a0336d034b8b04bd8e5b509247dd/0_0_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19481adee6d4a8d160739008171636df","title":"brexit divides tensions political vote","story":"Tensions have been bubbling away for decades. Political parties have smoothed them over – the Brexit vote exploded themObviously, the Brexit ide is only symptomatic of even more fundamental differences. Not long after the referendum, it was no great surprise to read that how voters felt about Europe slotted into their opinions on multiculturalism, social liberalism, the internet, globalisation and immigration nor that such factors as age, class and education had been central to how people voted. Indeed, when I was out on the road during the campaign, it felt as if an even simpler question would decide the outcome: whether your view of the globalist, liberal future into which the country seemed to be inevitably heading was optimistic, or whether prejudice or a pessimism rooted in deep economic insecurity (or both) had pushed you to the opposite conclusion.Now, it would be foolish to pretend that millions of people aren’t contradictory bundles of both sets of views. Moreover, in the sense that pre-Brexit electoral politics often meant that the two main parties had to aim at bringing very different voters together in order to win elections, the gaps between large parts of the electorate were constantly smoothed over. The grim political perfection of Brexit, by contrast, was that it represented a convulsive argument about a package of stuff that went straight to the heart of all of these tensions, and decisively pushed people one way or the other. This was David Cameron’s unforgivable oversight. What had been bubbling away for decades therefore exploded – and, in the manner of a political combustion engine, is now doing so again and again.Where did it all originate? As with so many aspects of the modern English condition, it is a good idea to start by going back to George Orwell and his brilliant essay The Lion and the Unicorn (1941), partly an exploration of deep English attitudes that still linger. He wrote of an English working class “outstanding in their abhorrence of foreign habits”. But he also took aim at a pious, snobby middle-class mindset that ran deep among prewar progressives, and which one now detects among certain elements of the pro-remain crowd. The words are well-known: “England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality ... In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution.”Which brings us to the 1960s. It is no accident that many of the politicians – May, Farage, Rees-Mogg – who now sit at the heart of Brexit have the look of people untouched by the huge social changes that originated back then. That decade’s self-expression and social liberalism widened the differences Orwell had described, but at the same time, something else happened. The same rising inidualism created the conditions for the laissez-faire economics that first took root in the UK and US in the early 1980s, ravaged no end of industrial communities, and pushed politics away from the kind of collectivist thinking that had started to fade as the shadow of the second world war receded. The key point was made perfectly by the British music writer Charles Shaar Murray: “The line from hippie to yuppie is not nearly as convoluted as some people like to believe.”By the 1990s, affluence was increasingly synonymous with open, liberal, metropolitan thinking. By contrast, people and places who were left out of that decade’s prosperity felt the urge to reject this idea of modernity, and look for something different. In Britain and elsewhere, it was eventually provided by wealthy right-wingers who had no more experienced economic hardship than they had been to the moon, but such ironies should hardly be surprising: political history is full of them.With old political models crumbling as the centre empties out, the basic nature of 21st-century debate is becoming clear all over the world. A recent New York Times piece about the success of the German Greens explained that “the party represents a gentrified lifestyle, from healthy eating to a certain self-image, that of liberal nonconformism, that was once considered niche but has become mainstream”, and is devoutly “pro-environment, pro-Europe and pro-immigration”. At the other end of the spectrum sits Alternative für Deutschland, whose front ranks are smattered with former soldiers, and – to quote from Der Spiegel – is seen, particularly in the deprived former East, “as a guarantor against Germany becoming a multicultural society”.Notwithstanding very German factors, all this reflects not just what is happening in Europe, but the predicament of the US: arguably the first country where a great chasm between liberals and conservatives opened up and the latter eventually embraced reactionary nationalism, with the result that two great demographic blocs now stare across the ide with a mixture of mutual mistrust and bafflement.Here, we may soon be just as estranged from each other. When I was growing up in the 1970s and 80s in comfortable suburbia, my parents had come from working-class homes into the middle class, but retained the same values that had defined their childhoods, so there was no great cultural gap between me and schoolfriends who came from a wide variety of backgrounds. Cars, houses and holidays offered people some means of keeping up with the Joneses, but there was nothing like the modern consumerist culture built on the constant imperative to somehow appear sophisticated and successful. TV offered three channels. Politics was largely a simple choice between two different views of the state and economic distribution.But then came the things that have so pushed us apart. Social mobility stalled. Deindustrialisation carried on apace. Insecurity skyrocketed. The complexity of modern society burst into public debate. And our sources of information eventually fragmented, with two key effects. Malign forces found new openings. More generally, we are now close to losing any coherent sense of who “we” are: one of the reasons why all that talk from Brexiteers about the will of the people seems so absurd.In the long run, it’s not clear how Labour and the Conservatives will accommodate our modern ferment. At the 2017 election, Jeremy Corbyn’s party piled on votes from young, urban and educated people and the Tories found new openings among working-class Brexit supporters, but the result only highlighted our national deadlock. Though Brexit looks to me like an epochal disaster to which the best answer is probably another public vote, there is another question, which politicians’ inevitable fixation with backstops, borders and customs unions leaves untouched: how the array of deep social and cultural questions tangled up in the events of the last two years will eventually be settled. I also wonder how we construct online spaces, public institutions and media outlets that might protect some coherent idea of the national interest and genuinely public debate. One thing, though, seems obvious: that we are in the midst of things we have only just begun to understand, and the deafening noise from Westminster is only the start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9eda2df4cce98bcac8ef3d5e99d71c566c8dce4/29_38_4763_2858/master/4763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83261c3173f649bfd16ec4b3360460bd","title":"jeremy corbyn europe socialists brexit","story":"In an open letter, we ask you to do all you can to stop Brexit – and spearhead the movement for progressive change in EuropeWe are writing to you as fellow socialists and progressives to urge you to work with us for the future of our continent.The left is resurgent across Europe each of us sees this in our own movements, and in one another’s. Your Labour party, the breadth of its vision, the passion of its language, the strength of its membership, has brought inspiration and optimism to us all. Which we need, for the picture is not at all rosy. Fascism is on the rise within Europe, buoyed and supported, implicitly and explicitly, by an invigorated authoritarianism without. Corporate interests prevail, unchecked by a post-ideological politics which has exhausted itself. Climate change becomes climate crisis, and those who deny it become ever more forceful.We all have deep misgivings about the dominant institutions of the European Union, and what they have become over the past three decades. The contagious creed of austerity has spread through its airways. The interests of capital and global corporations have come to take precedence over those of citizens. Despite more wealth than ever before, the disparities across the continent have fostered exploitation and insecurity. And despite the liberty and adventure that the EU has opened up, the deaths in the Mediterranean are evidence of the emergence of terrifying new and old prejudices and fears.Yet we are not ready to surrender this once great project to those who would subvert it. To do so would betray its creators, whose values we cherish. More importantly, it would leave us weakened when we most need our strength, and isolated when we most need our solidarity. There is no answer to any of these questions that is not transnational. There is no way that our frustrated fellow citizens will feel represented unless they can be heard at European and global levels.We need you in the EU. Nobody understands better what it takes – from the law, from the union movement, from activism – to bring to life and fruition the ambitions and dreams of every citizen. We need you, as you can become a catalyst for a different Europe, providing new and necessary momentum for true progressive change. We need one another, just as we needed one another at the inception of the EU, to meet the most urgent challenges mankind can ever face: to avoid war to foster equality to cooperate in the face of threats to our planet to harness solidarity that it might achieve the most of which it is capable.As your trades unions point out, it is usual in a negotiation that the final deal is taken back to the members.

Everyone remembers the hopelessly sentimental Art Garfunkel theme song. Many will never forget the trauma of witnessing big-eyed bunny rabbits being mercilessly and bloodily slain.In an interview published in the Radio Times Christmas edition, Adams’s daughters explain how the book, first published when their father was a civil servant in his mid-50s, came into being.They also address the multiple theories about the true message of Watership Down. “Honestly, the stuff we got through the post from fans about what they think the book is about,” said Rosamond.“‘Is Woundwort an allegory of Stalin?’ ‘Is Hazel Jesus Christ?’ It shows that people really connect with the story, they really think hard about it, but it cut no ice with Dad. ‘Rubbish!’ he always said. ‘It’s just a story about rabbits.’”They recall being six and eight in the mid-60s and on a long car journey to the theatre from London to Stratford-upon-Avon. They pestered their dad for a story and then came: “Once upon a time there were two rabbits called Hazel and Fiver …”Persuaded by his daughters to put pen to paper, Adams’s book was published in 1972 and won the Carnegie medal and the  children’s book prize.The 1978 animation, featuring the voices of John Hurt and Richard Briers, was scarringly graphic.Rightly so, said the daughters. “Daddy didn’t like the way people babied, and pandered to and ‘icky-ised’ children, lying to them about death and so on,” said Juliet. “We’re destroying the environment and endangering all the animals – I think it would be strange to ignore that.”Producers have suggested the new version, a BBCNetflix co-production, will be less violent. There will also be more comedy and more prominent female characters.Nicholas Hoult, who voices Fiver, has predicted people will watch it and cry. “I remember me and (director) Noam (Murro) both crying when we were doing the last scene. We were both hugging as we were crying. I did the take probably 450 times and I cried every single time. I defy anyone not to cry.”Other voices include Gemma Arterton, Anne-Marie Duff, John Boyega, James McAvoy and Olivia Colman. Sam Smith has recorded a song called Fire On Fire with the BBC Concert Orchestra. The programme will be shown on on Saturday 22 December and Sunday 23 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

That perennially excellent actor Toni Collette gave us some of the best work of her career as Annie, a contemporary artist and miniaturist. She specialises in intricately wrought dioramas with scenes taken from her own life, all reduced to Lilliputian scale. Clearly, this artistic approach says something about her own control-freakery and dysfunction. Annie’s elderly mother, an unpleasant old woman with whom Annie and her husband did not particularly get on, has just died after a long history of dementia. But then she makes contact from beyond the grave, wanting somehow to take over Annie’s 13-year-old son, her grandson, and somehow claim him in the cause of evil.The atmosphere of impending horror is terrifically managed – it has something of Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby. It doesn’t rely on the tired digital sound-stabs and jump-scares of lesser scary movies, but that isn’t to say that Aster is too grand to give us one or two old-fashioned cattle-prod jabs. I lurched and convulsed a couple of times, once at something so normally innocuous as the childlike sound of someone doing the clip-clopping sound of a horse. There are other excellent contributions from Gabriel Byrne, playing the stolid, supportive but careworn husband, from Milly Shapiro as their daughter Charlie, and also from Alex Wolff – already a familiar player in teen and YA movies – who is very good in this.What the film’s satirical meanings are is an open question. The topic of dementia – how we should react to it and open up the conversation around it – has become more current. It could be that Hereditary is providing a complex, subversive slant on this issue. But I think it is more nihilist than that. It is more about the mental squeeze of middle-age, and the dark fear or even horror of older people, in the light of an increasingly undeniable truth that you are going to turn into one of them. When I first saw this, I wrote that it was like a death-metal version of Cries and Whispers, and the director has since revealed that he screened Cries and Whispers for the cast. Since then, I have found myself thinking more about Fanny and Alexander and its puppet theatre. There is something inexpressibly sinister about Annie’s miniatures, and the suspicion that these human beings are themselves just figures being moved around by the devil himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dc4246f5dad564c1009605a3ed1342f99134c78/0_14_2871_1723/master/2871.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3bbd0dc1cffb3ad2d963c93530ad9ce","title":"copa libertadores final river plate boca juniors match report","story":"• River Plate 3-1 Boca Juniors (aet 5-3 on agg)• Pratto 68 Quintero 109 Martínez 120 | Benedetto 44It may be marked with an asterisk and there could be more chapters to come in this extraordinary story, soaked in symbolism, sport and society, drama and emotion too, raw and exhilarating to the last, but River Plate are the Copa Libertadores winners – clinching a title they and Boca Juniors, their great rivals from across Buenos Aires, always knew would be forever.The game that would never end, reached the very, very end. “It’s been almost 60 days since this started and there is tremendous sadness,” said the Boca manager, Guillermo Schelotto. With 120 minutes gone and River 2-1 up, he watched as Leonardo Jara hit the post, the tension clawing at nerves as never before. That left Boca with one last chance: a corner the referee seemed determined to delay, as if clinging to this game, not wanting to let it go, and their goalkeeper Esteban Andrada in attack where he had been for seven or eight minutes already. It also left them exposed.As Boca desperately sought salvation, some miracle, suddenly River were racing away. Gonzalo Martínez raced up the pitch, no one between him and an empty goal. So sure were River of the goal that as he ran one way, his teammates ran every which way, celebrating already from the bench they ran too, staff on the pitch, hearts racing. Boca’s players, meanwhile, crumpled on to the turf. By then there were only nine of them out there, one man sent off, another walking off injured and in tears, the rest exhausted physically and emotionally.A wonderful goal from Juan Quintero, the game’s outstanding player, had put River ahead and Boca on the edge of the abyss, the darkness of a defeat that is for ever now they tumbled into it.One-nil up, they had been beaten 3-1 in an extraordinary occasion getting an astonishing finish. The legal challenge on this game going ahead, Boca appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, might suggest further battles to come, an attempt to annul this result and anaesthetise their pain, but Schelotto insisted: “For me, it’s over. River won.”They won 5-3 on aggregate, the never-ending match finally ending, two weeks late, 6,248 miles away, at the fifth attempt and in the last second of extra time. It had taken a month, amid biblical storms, violence and arguments, politics and ambition. The first leg finished 2-2 on 10 November before the second Boca’s bus was attacked, windows smashed with bricks. Players vomited and were taken to hospital, glass shards in eyes, tear gas in their throats. It was put back an hour, then another, then another, to a backdrop of conflict, police charges and violence, until Conmebol announced it would be held the next day.It was not. A postponement became something a little more permanent although the match was to be played, the idea the trophy should be left without a winner dismissed, pressure applied and politics appearing, it was taken out of River’s Monumental stadium, out of Buenos Aires and South America. The trophy, named after the continent’s liberators, was handed over in the capital of Spain.In crossing the Atlantic it was inevitable it would change, an event attended by players from Barcelona, Bayern, Juventus and Real Madrid, over 72,000 people but too few of those who were supposed to have attended it. There were, though, fans from both teams – unusually, given that in Argentina away fans are banned between these teams – and plenty of noise, if little of the paraphernalia: no ticker-tape or fireworks, less of that wildness that helps make it attractive – that untamed quality.There was something of that in the way it was actually played, though. Every inch was fought for, a permissive Peruvian referee allowing it. Once or twice it made one wince. No quarter would be given. There was little flow and chances were few at first, even though ultimately all four goals were impressive.Most of the early opportunities fell to Boca. Pablo Pérez, the captain with the eye patch a fortnight ago, had the best, first denied by Franco Armani, then seeing a deflected shot squirm wide. Armani then prevented Sebastian Villa’s cross reaching Dario Benedetto but the River keeper could do nothing when Benedetto came running towards him to open the scoring superbly. From Boca’s bench they ran to join him in the corner, the noise shaking the stadium.River responded, particularly after the introduction of Quintero. They were denied a penalty 10 minutes into the second half when Andrada clattered into Lucas Pratto but the momentum built and Pratto provided the finish to a lovely move involving Nacho Fernández and Exequiel Palacios to equalise.And so it went on, even longer. Extra time came. All that and it came down to this. Penalties seemed inevitable and while that wasn’t to be, there was drama. Boca were reduced to 10, Wilmar Barrios sent off, and River turned the screw, 18-year-old Julián Álvarez flashing the best of three shots over before Quintero smashed a brilliant shot in off the bar.Boca were in bits but they chased and chased to the last, fighting until they could do no more, something almost admirably primitive in it all: in the effort, the emotion, and the final run of an extraordinary month until Martínez was all alone in Madrid, a long way from home yet exactly where he would have dreamed of being, an empty goal opening before him and before the eyes of the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1a90f78d71a6a6efd0db842864770bea9286b3/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54efdd9589b06222117219d0d7f57d54","title":"premier league 10 talking points football","story":"Bournemouth are looking threadbare, Pep Guardiola shows the stomach for a fight and Leicester pine for Jamie VardyWith the issues piling up in terms of Arsenal’s defensive composition, it almost passed unnoticed that against Huddersfield they managed a league clean sheet – their first since September. Centre‑back concerns felt strongly under the microscope at the end of a week when Rob Holding suffered a cruciate injury, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi picked up simultaneous suspensions for their yellow card count, and the German skulked off with an injury in any case. Unai Emery has to find, to borrow an old Wengerism, internal solutions for Sunday’s game at Southampton. Stephan Lichtsteiner and Nacho Monreal, career full-backs, could be drafted in to a back three. Laurent Koscielny has not played for seven months and was not deemed fit enough to come on against Huddersfield. Emery will have to make do and mend. Amy LawrenceMohamed Salah put on a masterclass in finishing at Bournemouth but there was no denying that Eddie Howe’s players gave Liverpool a helping hand during a meek and error-strewn second-half performance that exposed weaknesses in a squad that appears to be creaking. With Lewis Cook joining Dan Gosling and Adam Smith on the sidelines, and Callum Wilson also missing with a hamstring injury, Bournemouth are looking a little thin on the ground at a time when their form has badly tailed off. The fixture list has not been kind but five defeats in six games – and given how well Huddersfield played on Tuesday they could have lost all six – has punctured some of that early season optimism. Bournemouth are still eighth, only three points behind Manchester United, but January could be a good time for Howe to freshen things up. Stuart JamesAfter two hernia operations in six months, the return of James Tarkowski to full fitness will be a great relief to Sean Dyche, who has witnessed Burnley suffer a poor start to the season, not aided by the fact his natural replacement, Ben Gibson, is yet to make a league appearance because of a similar problem. Although Tarkowski has made 13 league appearances the hernia has continued to trouble him. He first underwent surgery in the summer but a second operation recently seems to have helped him overcome his pains, crucially allowing him to take his place alongside Ben Mee. Tarkowski’s third Premier League goal of the season was decisive but a clean sheet for a team who had conceded 32 times in 15 previous league matches will be a further boost that can be built on heading into two tough games, against Tottenham and Arsenal. Will UnwinIt may seem unfair to argue Callum Paterson should not be leading the line just after he has scored a winner, but imagine what Cardiff might be capable of with a proven Premier League goalscorer in their ranks. It must be especially galling for Bobby Reid and Gary Madine, forwards with a single goal between them this season. Neil Warnock travelled to France on a scouting trip this month and the Nantes striker Emiliano Sala is among those on his January wish list. The Cardiff manager has built a unique side, one dripping in team spirit, but after passing up several chances before eventually finding the breakthrough, it is no secret they are short of quality in the final third. “We all know what we need,” Warnock said. “It’s no good looking for a certain type of player because they’ve got to be able to work hard as well as put the ball in the net.” Ben FisherPep Guardiola was sanguine while dissecting a first Premier League loss, expressing joy and satisfaction at his players’ performance even in defeat, until the relentlessness of the ision cropped up. “You don’t have to tell me how competitive this league is,” he snapped back. “It’s you and your analysts that keep saying we are invincible, that we are perfect and that, in February, we are going to win the league. You said that. All of you. Not the manager, not any player, not the club.” He had a point. It was refreshing to see a team resist City so effectively, to leave Liverpool alone as unbeaten – already a fine achievement – but the champions’ focus remains. Maybe the title race will be tighter this time round, extending further into the spring, but Guardiola already seemed to be thrilling to the challenge. His belief in his players will not be dented by a solitary defeat. Dominic FifieldChelsea’s form had been sketchy before Saturday, and Maurizio Sarri’s tactics were partially responsible. So wedded is he to his philosophy that for him, change constitutes bringing off a player in order to replace him with whoever on the bench is most similar. This was evident in the goalless home draw with Everton and the defeats by Spurs and Wolves, suggesting a belief that his system is infallible and when it doesn’t work, the problem is necessarily one of personnel. But against Manchester City we saw the first modifications to it: N’Golo Kanté took on a slightly deeper role, starting closer to Jorginho, while Eden Hazard, nominally Chelsea’s centre-forward, roved about the pitch as he pleased. Both moves were crucial in securing a landmark victory – what may, in later years, be identified as the point at which the Sarri era truly began. Daniel HarrisA first defeat in seven gives little cause for Leicester to panic but the manner of their reverse against Spurs did lay bare an elephant in the room. They missed the injured Jamie Vardy for a second consecutive week and it showed, with Kelechi Iheanacho putting in a skittish performance in his stead and hearing some of the crowd cheer when he was taken off. Vardy turns 32 next month and, while he is a remarkable specimen, the time will soon come when the zip and incisiveness that have been so fundamental to Leicester’s success begin to tail off. Claude Puel was noncommittal when asked whether he would supplement his attack in January but it is probably time for a little succession planning. Leicester remain a far less potent proposition without their attacking talisman and that, sooner rather than later, will have to change. Nick AmesThe sign of how far Manchester United have fallen is that there was genuine surprise in Fulham suffering a 4-1 trouncing at the hands of José Mourinho’s team. The corollary of this is particularly concerning for Claudio Ranieri’s new team: it shows just how poor they are and how much of an achievement it would be for him to save the bottom side from the drop. Fulham have nine points, the same as Southampton, yet United could only draw at St Mary’s the previous Saturday. Ranieri’s men carried minimal menace and were seriously off the pace with and without the ball. As the Italian put it: “I said to my players: ‘If you play like in the first half it is the way to relegation. But if we play like in the second half we can survive.’” Next up are West Ham, Newcastle, Wolves and Huddersfield Fulham have to start collecting points soon. Jamie JacksonAfter a run of one point from six games that suggested Wolves were perhaps not the greatest team to ever win promotion to the Premier League, two victories have set them back on track. But maybe most encouraging for Nuno Espírito Santo’s side in those two games is the attacking dynamism and threat that has often been absent, specifically from Diogo Jota. The forward scored 18 goals last season but had not managed any this term before the win over Chelsea: now he has two in two, and he added to his strike against Newcastle by providing the driving run from which Matt Doherty eventually got their winner. They still have only 17 goals from 16 games, fewer than every other team above 13th and only one more than bottom-placed Fulham, but if Jota can keep up this form then they will look in much better shape. Nick MillerRobert Snodgrass’s resurgence at West Ham is proof that hard work pays off. A £10m signing from Hull in January 2017, the winger was a figure of scorn at the London Stadium until Manuel Pellegrini’s arrival in the summer and it seemed his future lay elsewhere when David Sullivan, the club’s co-owner, said that it was a mistake to buy him last year. But while Slaven Bilic was happy to loan Snodgrass to Aston Villa at the start of last season, Pellegrini told the Scotland international that he would give him a chance if he shed some pounds. Leaner and meaner now, the 31‑year‑old’s influence has grown since Andriy Yarmolenko ruptured an achilles in October and he chose a fine way to score his first Premier League goal for West Ham in their win over Crystal Palace, sparking a thrilling comeback with a curling strike from 20 yards.

Racism in football, racism in the media, racism in society as a whole and from certain high-up quarters the response has been to show sympathy and support for Sterling and call for change. But here’s the thing: nothing will change. It never does when it comes to racism in this country.That is what Sterling picked up on in his post. Two footballers, his Manchester City teammates Tosin Adarabioyo and Phil Foden, have bought expensive properties at a relatively young age but, while one is portrayed as the nice kid next door doing something for his mum, the other is made out to be greedy and thick. You don’t have to be a genius, or indeed have seen Sterling’s post, to figure out which is which.Sterling has, of course, experienced this first-hand – the stories about his expensive sink and his easyJet flight, lazy tabloid tales told by lazy tabloid journalists, painting him out to be a villain, the black kid riding around in a hoodie ready to knife you and your family at any given moment – and he’s finally had enough. What is alleged to have happened to him during City’s 2-0 defeat by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday has tipped this usually quiet, shy young man over the edge, which in itself speaks volumes.So yes, we have a race problem in this country and it’s nice to see so many people acknowledge that. Especially all the white middle‑class men who work in the national, mainstream media who simply couldn’t wait to get on Twitter on Sunday and tell the world how they feel Sterling’s pain and how it’s time to ease not only that pain but the pain of all young black people in this country. Yet how much do you want to bet that, come Monday morning, this will all be forgotten by those same people? They’ll move on to the next story, feeling they’ve done their bit, while in truth they have done nothing at all.Because that’s what race is to the national, mainstream media in this country – a story for today. It’s not something they actually want to tackle or rectify. And why would they when practically all the people in power – the CEOs, the editors, the main broadcasters and main writers – are all white? They make the decisions and, ultimately, they look after themselves.Black people are allowed in but only if they play certain roles. Hence why you see jovial types such as Ian Wright and Chris Kamara go far, or safe, nice types like Jermaine Jenas and Alex Scott do the same. They are the acceptable faces of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) representation in this country’s media, a minority within a minority, so is it any wonder that the coverage of BAME sportspeople, and young black footballers especially, is so skewed and harmful?As far as the British media are concerned, someone who looks like me is not allowed to talk like me. I’m dangerous, not to be trusted and tolerated. Of course it’s OK for Roy Keane to be outspoken and controversial. If anything, he’s not controversial enough. But me – no, it’s not accepted. Hence me finding myself off screens and radios in my own country and having to work instead in Russia.Some people will call me paranoid or outright wrong but I’m not and I have recent proof of this. In June I did an interview with the  in which I made similar points to those I’m making here – calling out racist attitudes in the media. Did anyone in the media pay attention, show sympathy or an appetite to change things? Of course they didn’t. Instead the whole thing was reduced to a “war of words” between Stan Collymore and Ian Wright, and of course “Wrighty” won because everyone loves “Wrighty”. He’s the guy with the cheeky grin and infectious laugh, while I’m the big, bad black man that’s not to be trusted. All of which ignores the fact Ian works for the Sun, a newspaper which has done as much as any other to vilify Sterling.But that’s what always happens – the double standards and hypocrisy get swept under the carpet because nobody in this country, and in the media especially, actually wants to tackle race in this country. Everyone’s speaking about it now because one of our most famous, and brilliant, footballers has raised the issue, but it will soon be forgotten. If not tomorrow then certainly in the days and weeks that follow.So thank you to all the white, middle-class media personalities in this country for showing you care. But until you actually turn your words into actions and get more BAME people into your organisations to make sure BAME coverage is fairer, kinder and more balanced, I don’t want to know. And, judging by his Instagram post, I’m pretty sure Raheem Sterling feels the same way.Stan Collymore is a former Liverpool, Aston Villa and England forward who currently works as a broadcaster for Russian state television channel RT"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c555946a43d23b813cb78632b93fd33ac472c9b/0_23_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de0005c2a3d367fc704e8bd8cbd21e69","title":"nicaragua journalists press freedom crackdown ortega","story":"Journalists have been beaten, arrested, and robbed in the wake of the civil revolt that paralysed the country earlier in the year﻿Nicaraguan TV journalist Miguel Mora was driving home from work when he was pulled over by armed police.It was the sixth time Mora had been detained by police in the space of a week. He also faces criminal charges of “inciting hate”, while drones have filmed his house and armed men on motorbikes track his movements.Such intimidation is part of an escalating assault on press freedoms in Nicaragua, unleashed in the wake of the civil revolt that paralysed the country earlier in the year.“This government has banned protest, captured opposition leaders, and now the only thing preventing a totalitarian dictatorship is the independent media,” says Mora. “This is the stage where they try to silence us.”Anti-government protests broke out in April, sparked by the mismanagement of fires in a protected reserve and fuelled by fiscal reforms that slashed social security. They spread after police used live ammunition on demonstrators, killing dozens.From the start of the unrest, the government tried to control coverage, pressuring media bosses to self-censor. Journalists at Channel 10 – owned by Mexican tycoon Remigio Ángel González – were initially barred from reporting on demonstrations.“It was absurd: historic events were unfolding and we were ignoring them,” says Mauricio Madrigal, the station’s news editor. He and others threatened to resign, and the prohibition was dropped.After that approach failed, officials turned to more direct tactics. Twelve members of Madrigal’s team have since quit, fearing for their family’s safety.“Every independent journalist has received death threats,” says Gerall Chávez, a reporter with VosTV, whose house was vandalised in August. One journalist has been killed during the violence in total, more than 490 violations of press freedom have been documented in the course of the crisis.Now, having regained control of the streets, the government is determined to impose control over the narrative. In doing so, it aims to ensure impunity for the state forces that slaughtered hundreds of protesters.“It’s an Orwellian strategy, to falsify the reality of the repression,” says Sofia Montenegro, a journalist and former Sandinista guerrilla who fought alongside President Daniel Ortega in the 1970s.The official version of events is disseminated through a media empire built by Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua’s first lady and, since 2017, vice-president.In 2007, shortly after her husband returned to power, Murillo published an ominous communication strategy, outlining plans to prevent critical media “contaminating” public perception of his administration.Through the next decade, Murillo spent millions of dollars of Venezuelan cooperation funds – ostensibly destined for poverty reduction – on buying up Nicaragua’s media.TV channels 4, 8, 9 and 13 are now owned by her children also under the family’s control are Radio Ya, Radio Nicaragua and Radio Sandino, state broadcaster Channel 6, and the online news service El 19 Digital.From April, this media apparatus worked to whitewash the government’s deadly response to the protests.“We presented an alternative reality, where protesters were rightwing extremists killing Sandinistas,” says Carlos Mikel Espinoza, who was editor of El 19 Digital when protests broke out. “It was fascistic, an attempt to infuse hatred into government supporters and police.” Espinoza quit and fled to Costa Rica in June, after police and militants burned alive a family of six in their own home.Murillo’s strategy has failed. Polls show that just one in five Nicaraguans believe the official line that “those who participated in roadblocks and marches are terrorists”. But this hasn’t stopped the Ortega-controlled courts prosecuting protesters as if they were the violent extremists government propaganda claims.“We challenge this fantasy reality every day,” Miguel Mora concludes. “The logical next step – which I fully expect them to take – is to send their paramilitaries to close us down altogether.“That would leave only their version of events: a pure, uncontaminated discourse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0664b4f144163734d8c9838d809b72aba48cedbd/0_167_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91fbb68df69f029c8025a49be42d56f2","title":"plans expand commonhold home ownership system landlords uk","story":"Law Commission backs move that would offer alternative to landlord-controlled leaseholdsThe rarely used “commonhold” system of home ownership should be expanded as an alternative to landlord-controlled leaseholds which are increasingly resented, the Law Commission is recommending.In a public consultation launched on Monday, the government’s official adviser on law reform is calling for commonhold to become widely available because it permits anyone to own a freehold flat without the threat of a time-limited lease expiring.Commonholders become members of a company that owns and manages the shared areas and structure of a building. There is no landlord.The proposal would primarily benefit flat owners, many of whom are young and climbing the first rungs of the property ladder but still have to pay substantial annual ground rents.Introduced in 2002 as a cooperative form of ownership, fewer than 20 commonholds have been created. The system has been criticised for lacking the flexibility required for larger developments and for converting existing leases into commonholds. Mortgage lenders have also proved reluctant to provide loans against commonhold properties.Prof Nick Hopkins, a commissioner at the Law Commission, said: “Commonhold provides a once in a generation opportunity to rethink how we own property in England and Wales and offers homeowners an alternative system to leasehold.“It involves a culture change, moving away from an ‘us and them’ mindset, towards ‘us and ourselves’. We want to hear what people think of our proposals so we can be sure the commonhold system will work for homeowners and the wider property sector.”The legal reforms proposed, the Law Commission says, should make conveyancing simpler and cheaper. They would allow commonhold developments to include both flats and commercial units, such as restaurants and shops.Service charges levied by landlords would be replaced by commonhold contributions, which have to be approved by a majority of those paying them. The legal changes would make it easier to convert from leasehold to commonhold and increase mortgage lender confidence in the system, it is argued.Commonhold is widely used in countries such as the US, Australia and across Europe. The Law Commission points to “recent dissatisfaction” with the current leasehold system, which has led to pressure from campaigners for reform.In order that repair bills are paid, the commission proposes that a commonhold association should have an “automatic, statutory charge” for the payment of costs if a unit owner fails to pay his or her share of contributions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35fd3d188549ca8467f69431a9267e3ece358c89/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90a288bfb32c8f5754d1233f09b7b1f5","title":"im in a relationship with another man but he identifies as straight","story":"We kiss and cuddle, but he won’t go beyond a certain point physically and says he loves me as a brother.

She recommends adding chicken, turkey, fish, dairy products and eggs into your diet. Good sources for vegetarians and vegans are legumes, nuts, tofu and quinoa. Complex carbohydrates and iron are also important.The trichologist Anabel Kingsley notes that diet, although important, will only strengthen newly forming strands, not hair that has already grown. She says using the wrong brush is one of the most common causes of breakage, and advises using a brush with plastic, rounded prongs. Brushing hair from the ends and gently working your way to the top of the head also helps avoid snapping strands.Hairdryers and heated styling tools can leave hair brittle and lacking in shine. “Heat can, in a sense, cook the hair,” says the dermatologist Dr Zoe Draelos. “Think of it like a piece of steak – it starts out nice and soft and flexible, but when you cook it, the steak changes texture and becomes hard. Similarly, hair transforms when exposed to heat over time.” She recommends allowing hair to air dry when possible, and if using a hairdryer, to use a protective spray or serum and to start off on the lowest setting before gradually increasing the heat.Cold weather can exacerbate dandruff.

She said she was “looking for a person who can unite the party behind the Brexit deal” and said Brexiters should get behind one candidate, but did not name anyone.Grieve, who authored an amendment for next week that MPs could use to attempt to block a no-deal Brexit, said a formal split looked possible.“There is a risk the party will split and cannot continue in its current form,” he said, adding that Johnson would be a “disastrous leader” for the Conservatives and he would personally find it “very difficult in those circumstances to take the Conservative whip”.The former cabinet minister Justine Greening hinted that she believed parliament was unworkable in its current form. “People are utterly fed up to the back teeth with parliament being stuck on Brexit and nothing else – it can’t go on like this,” she told the .Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng played down the prospect of a formal split in the party, although he said it was possible some MPs could resign the whip.“I think that when the party split in the 19th century it was so devastating that the Conservative party is almost wired in its DNA not to split,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I think one or two people might leave, I don’t know who they will be.”Speculation about the leadership intensified over the weekend, with suggestions that the cabinet ministers Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt, and the former Brexit secretary David Davis would also run if May were to quit. Javid is hosting a joint Christmas drinks for MPs alongside the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom.Speculation has also mounted that the newly returned cabinet minister Amber Rudd could be mulling an alliance with the environment minister, Michael Gove, though it is unclear which of them would put themselves forward for the top job.Appearing on Sky News, Raab, another former Brexit secretary, said when asked about his leadership ambitions: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out, but I’m just not going to get sucked into that debate.” He said the public would think it indulgent to do so.Raab said he believed May could still hang on as leader “even in the event of a big loss on the vote” because he thought “she could still turn it round” by immediately trying to renegotiate the deal. “If parliament has voted the deal down I think she can go and say this deal doesn’t work for the United Kingdom.” Raab said no deal could be a better outcome if May could not force further concessions. “Ultimately we need to be willing to walk away,” he said.Johnson and McVey made similar points about the need to remove the backstop and withhold some of the £39bn orce bill until a comprehensive free trade agreement is signed between the UK and the EU.The prime minister resigns after a humiliating defeat. Many MPs believe she will have to go if she loses by more than 100 votes. An interim prime minister would have to be chosen while the Tory party plans a leadership contest.May begs Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, left, to go the\u0026nbspextra mile and reopen the talks. She asks for\u0026nbspconcessions over the Irish backstop, and then puts whatever she can secure to a second vote in the Commons.Plenty of Conservative and Labour MPs would be happy to see a soft-Brexit, Norway-style solution that keeps Britain in the single market, as suggested by Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary. Although she has\u0026nbsppreviously rubbished the idea, May could do a U-turn and try to sell it\u0026nbspas a compromise to avoid the disaster of no deal.With her deal ditched, and if “no deal” is also ruled out by parliament, May’s least worst option could be to go back to the people. Many Tory MPs are pushing her to do so. If Labour officially backs the idea, a second referendum –as suggested by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary – could happen.If parliament cannot agree on what kind of exit from the European Union it wants, and if there is no majority for a second referendum, Britain hurtles towards a no-deal departure on 29 March 2019. A hardcore group of Brexiters led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg would rather accept trading with Europe on basic World Trade Organisation terms than May’s deal or any form of soft Brexit.If there is no agreement on anything, and “no deal” has been blocked off as an option by parliament, the other choice available is no Brexit. May or whoever is in charge could form a cross-party government of national unity, revoke Article\u0026nbsp50 and call the whole thing\u0026nbspoff.McVey argued the party’s support for May as prime minister was conditional on renegotiation. She told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that if May “goes out and gets the deal we want on those key points then she will remain as our prime minister”, adding: “If she doesn’t it is going to be very difficult for her.”Greening, who has said she will vote against the deal in order to push for a second referendum, said it was up to all MPs in parliament to find a way out of the spiral. The former education secretary said she was not convinced that a Norway-style deal would be any more acceptable than the prime minister’s deal.“Communities across the country are telling their MPs they don’t like the ‘one foot in, one foot out’ approach of the prime minister’s deal, but the reality is it’s the same problem with the Norway approach – they just leave everyone unhappy,” she said. “However unpalatable it is for MPs, if it’s gridlock in parliament, then MPs have to allow people to choose and find a consensus for themselves.”Grieve told Sky News that the European issue was of such “fundamental character” that it was clouding all the other issues where Tory colleagues could essentially agree. “That bothers me very much because one of the products of Brexit has been total paralysis on virtually every other area of policy,” he said.He said he opposed Johnson’s leadership because of his record, not just his hard-Brexit views. “It’s perhaps got less to do with issues around Brexit than I’m afraid my own assessment of his competence,” he said.Pressed on McVey’s leadership ambitions, Grieve said: “There are all sorts of people who may wish to throw their hat into the ring. At the moment I’m not very interested in finding a new leader because I think the process of finding a new leader in itself would be disastrous for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b9fa5e22812913c5ef96a2ef9c01d5c0658f21e/0_215_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f646de48a1b8adb7bd129bee767b37f9","title":"new leftwing coalition urges labour to reject brexit","story":"Activists want a people’s vote and option of remaining to be in any election manifestoA leftwing, remain-supporting coalition of Momentum activists, local party chairs and Labour councillors is to create a pop-up pressure group to persuade the Labour leadership to ditch a commitment to Brexit in any snap election manifesto.The push came as another Labour frontbencher, Rosena Allin-Khan, broke with the party line and backed a second referendum on the final deal in an onstage announcement at a People’s Vote rally on Sunday.The drive by the grassroots Labour group is the latest in a series of offensives to put pressure on the leadership to back a fresh poll if Theresa May’s deal fails to pass parliament.The pressure group, led by many of the anti-Brexit activists who were behind the push to put a second referendum policy to a vote of party members at Labour’s conference, will create a platform for pro-EU Labour voters to try to influence the leadership before any future manifesto launch.Organisers of the drive, who include the former CWU general secretary Billy Hayes, the national co-ordinator of the pro-EU group group Another Europe is Possible, Michael Chessum, as well as the MP Catherine West, say they have been convinced that a snap general election is on the horizon and want to shape Labour’s direction.In an open letter from 40 Labour activists, the group said: “As Labour members and supporters, we want our party to fight in the months ahead, including in any general election campaign, to stop the anti-working class disaster that is Brexit,” it said, adding that there is “concern that the party’s policy is “shifting, but is not yet committed to stopping Brexit”.In effect, the group hopes to force a more explicit commitment to a second referendum in the next Labour manifesto and for the party to campaign to remain.On Sunday, Rosena Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting and shadow sport minister, became the third frontbencher to back a second referendum. The ex-Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith was sacked for breaking that line earlier this year but more junior frontbenchers have escaped sanction.“Let’s end the economic uncertainty, let’s end the fear mongering – and let’s have a campaign on the facts,” she said. “If calls for a general election are rejected – I’ll be backing a people’s vote.”Party strategists are undecided about pursuing a formal no-confidence vote in the government if May loses the vote on her Brexit deal, one of the ways a snap general election could be triggered under the Fixed Term Parliament Act.The Democratic Unionist party, which May relies on to prop up her minority Conservative government, has vowed to vote against the Brexit deal but has said it will support the Conservatives in a no-confidence vote, meaning Labour would have to rely on Tory rebels to vote against their own party in order to pass the motion of no confidence.Labour may consider other paths, including a non-binding no-confidence motion in May herself, which Labour has previously attempted against the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, during the rail crisis.On Sunday, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, refused to confirm that Labour would table a confidence motion, saying, “let’s see what happens”.“If you can tell me whether she will still be prime minister on Tuesday evening, then perhaps I can tell you what exactly we will do next,” he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.Trickett sounded a note of caution against those in his party calling for a second referendum, an echo of the comments made in a private meeting by the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey.“If people feel that the privileged political elite has decided by subterfuge to find a way of reversing the previous referendum, that would cause us some difficulty, and rightly so,” he said.Both Corbyn and Labour’s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, insisted on Sunday the party’s primary strategy was to renegotiate a better Brexit deal.Corbyn told ITV that the government had to “go back, negotiate something that is acceptable, which does protect rights and conditions, which does give us that trade access, or they’ve got to get out of the way, have an election so that it will be a government here that will be serious about those negotiations”.Long-Bailey repeated the insistence that a Labour-backed Brexit deal would not require the controversial backstop arrangement because it would be the party’s primary policy to keep the UK in a customs union. “The backstop was installed to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show. “A permanent customs union would do exactly the same thing and it would offer that long-term certainty and that is what we would go into a negotiation advocating for.”However, a customs union alone does not avoid a hard border, because of the requirement to also do some regulatory checks which form part of the EU’s single market regulation.The Conservative party chair, Brandon Lewis, called the plan “a fantasy Brexit, which the EU has repeatedly ruled out”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa4e09756637fd7189a3bf187c82537bbd20e092/931_3_3407_2044/master/3407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a0ef88301f8995004237dc1c0e76753","title":"brexit deal vote latest theresa may ecj government says ecj ruling irrelevant because uk leaving eu anyway politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including day four of the Commons debate on the Brexit dealHere is some more reaction to the ECJ ruling.Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, says the judgment shows that article 50 could be extended to allow time for a referendum, with UK deciding to remain in the EU an option after that. (See 9.08am.)Jolyon Maugham, the lawyer who coordinated the legal case, says this is arguably the most important case in modern domestic legal history.Catherine Stihler, a Scottish Labour MEP who was one of the parliamentarians who brought the case, says this ruling could pave the way for Brexit to be halted. She said:This historic ruling paves the way for the disastrous Brexit process to be brought to a halt. We now know, beyond any doubt, that Westminster can revoke its withdrawal from the European Union.This has been a lengthy and expensive legal process, but the result proves that it was worthwhile. In an article for HuffPost, the Labour MP Chris Leslie and the Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, two of parliamentarians involved in the case, say this is a “game-changing moment”.Today the European Court of Justice has confirmed that the UK can unilaterally revoke its Article 50 notice. It’s a huge and game-changing moment, clarifying definitively that the British people have real choices about Brexit – and that we can still determine our own destiny. The timing of this judgment is especially valuable for Members of Parliament seeking the right path for the UK amidst the present political turbulence. It is now crystal clear we have real options beyond the Prime Minister’s tactical “my dealno deal” fiction.One potentially important feature of today’s EJC judgment is that it says the UK could unilaterally revoke article 50, not just during the two-year article 50 period, but during any possible extension too. In the full judgment (pdf) it says (with bold type added by me for emphasis):It follows from the foregoing that the notification by a member state of its intention to withdraw does not lead inevitably to the withdrawal of that member state from the European Union. On the contrary, a member state that has reversed its decision to withdraw from the European Union is entitled to revoke that notification for as long as a withdrawal agreement concluded between that member state and the European Union has not entered into force or, if no such agreement has been concluded, for as long as the two-year period laid down in article 50(3) TEU, possibly extended in accordance with that provision, has not expired.Theresa May has been speaking to EU leaders ahead of the summit starting on Thursday, including the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar, in a development that has intensified speculation that she is fighting to get new concessions on the backstop. She spoke to Varadkar last night. Commenting on the call, a spokesperson for Varadkar said the call was at May’s request. The spokesperson said:They discussed the current situation on Brexit, including the planned vote in Westminster on TuesdayThey also discussed preparation for this week’s European Council and looked forward to seeing each other in Brussels on Thursday.Michael Russell, the Scottish government’s constitutional affairs secretary, has issued this statement about the ECJ ruling. He said:This is a hugely important decision that provides clarity at an essential point in the UK’s decision making over its future relationship with the EU.People in Scotland overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and that continues to be the best option for Scotland and the UK as a whole.This judgment exposes as false the idea that the only choice is between bad deal negotiated by the UK government or the disaster of no deal.We now know, thanks to the efforts of Scotland’s parliamentarians, that remaining in the EU is still on the table.This will be a hectic, dramatic week, and it started with breaking news at 8am from the European court of justice, which has confirmed that the UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally, and remain in the EU on its current terms of membership (ie, with the rebate, and no obligation to join the euro).Here is our story.Here is a summary of the judgment (pdf). Here is an extract from it. And here is the text of the judgment in full (pdf).In today’s judgment, the full court has ruled that, when a member state has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union, as the UK has done, that member state is free to revoke unilaterally that notification.That possibility exists for as long as a withdrawal agreement concluded between the EU and that member state has not entered into force or, if no such agreement has been concluded, for as long as the two-year period from the date of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU, and any possible extension, has not expired.The revocation must be decided following a democratic process in accordance with national constitutional requirements. This unequivocal and unconditional decision must be communicated in writing to the European council.Such a revocation confirms the EU membership of the member state concerned under terms that are unchanged as regards its status as a member state and brings the withdrawal procedure to an end.And here is the first reaction from the government. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, told the Today programme that the ruling did not matter because the UK was leaving anyway. He said:Well, we don’t want to stay in the EU. We voted very clearly, 17.4m people sent a clear message that we want to leave the European Union. And that means also leaving the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. So, this case is all very well, but it doesn’t alter either the referendum vote or the clear intention of the government to make sure that we leave on March 29.In his interview he also insisted that tomorrow’s vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal will go ahead. I will post more from his interview soon.Here is the agenda for the day.After 3.30pm: David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, opens day four of the Commons debate on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will mostly be focusing on Brexit.Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news.

It has been there since the day my mother hid it from my teenage son. That day, attempts to get him up had repeatedly failed. He was hungry but refused to eat, he became increasingly volatile until eventually he threatened to hurl the iron at my head.I’d had enough objects thrown at me in the past to not take any chances. I ran out of the house and for the first time called the police. While I waited for them, my son punched through a window, the resulting cut narrowly missing his artery.Tom, 17, has various diagnoses – autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette’s, ADHD – that make it hard for him to communicate, deal with frustration and regulate his emotions. As he has grown older, he has become more challenging. He was exhibiting a range of coercive and obsessive behaviours centred on me that made life intolerable. I had a choice around these behaviours: I could carry them out … or else.“Or else” could mean screaming for hours, punching, kicking, threatening with heavy or sharp objects, property damaged – or me, my other children – and neighbours kept awake into the early hours and sometimes all night. “Or else” could mean my son harming himself it was the unspoken catalyst to my life shutting down.While some may find this shocking, for others it’s a familiar story. A freedom of information request last year revealed that in the year 201516, 10,051 cases of domestic violence against adults by children were investigated by 35 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Of these cases, 874 led to cautions being issued and 1,459 to juveniles being charged with offences.“My feeling is that it is more widespread,” says social worker and CPV campaigner Helen Bonnick. “I am seeing lots of links with CPV and children and young people’s mental health – so if, as we are told, that is worsening you would expect there to be a knock-on effect.”CPV and APV are more prevalent in particular groups – children with mental health problems or special needs the adoption and fostering communities families that have experienced domestic violence and where young people are abusing substances.Children within these risk groups may have “several overlapping issues”, says Bonnick. Early trauma, such as neglect or living with domestic violence, may have affected the way they react to stress – or had a modelling effect. Children who are abusing substances may lash out while intoxicated or demand money for drugs. Like Tom, those with mental health issues may be living with such high levels of anxiety that it takes very little to tip them into fight, flight or freeze.“Fundamentally,” says Bonnick, “we see young people who are trying to cope with the demands of life, and are having to ‘speak loudly’ to have their needs met. They may find stressful situations extremely hard to manage because of a neurological condition or early trauma. They may have learned that violence pays off in achieving certain ends.”However, CPV and APV is not exclusive to these groups. Rachel Condry found that APV occurred across the social spectrum and that while it is more commonly against mothers by sons, a significant proportion of fathers were victims and daughters perpetrators. In some families there was a clear cause, in others Condry said she “literally could not find a reason”.Tip of the iceberg What is clear, is that the problem is much wider than reported – “for very understandable reasons”, says Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives. “Those who experience intimate partner violence only call the police at a rate of one in five. We can all see the reasons why you would be even less likely to call the police about your child – and not just the police – there is so much attached in terms of any stigma people feel, and in terms of worries about consequences for themselves and the child.”Shame and fear can prevent parents seeking the help they need – as can lack of understanding from family, friends and agencies. “The kind of dismissiveness people in previous times applied to intimate partner violence is still applied to CPV,” says Jacob. “People end up minimising what is actually an incredibly serious issue in somebody’s home.”The insidious nature of domestic abuse also plays its part. “It can build up gradually,” says Bonnick, who runs the campaigning and resource website Holes in the Wall. “It takes a while to acknowledge that you are being abused … because it’s become so normal,” she says.Her observation resonates. I once described to a friend the lengths I had to go to in order to have a shower – reasons that included sleeping as long as I could after being awake most of the night, and also because often Tom would repeatedly batter the bathroom door. “You do realise,” she said after a long silence, “how very far from normal your life has become?”I did, and didn’t. In fact, all of us – my son, myself, and my two younger teenage children – existed in a kind of suspended reality. The scale of how wrong things were meant that when I did start contacting agencies for help, I found it almost impossible to articulate the problems.And in common with many, I had an uphill job getting people to really hear what was happening.“I think often people do ask for help and get knocked back – passed from one agency to another,” says Bonnick. “It can be very difficult to find where to go in the first place, and then even if you do approach an agency, what sort of help do you get?”It’s a good question. The reality is that there is no national blueprint for dealing with CPV and the quality of help families receive is patchy. “What you get is pockets of good practice,” says Condry, “but a lot of areas where there is practically nothing.”“There has been a massive retraction of funding for child and adolescent mental health and local services, and cuts in youth justice as well.”Last summer Jacob, Condry and Bonnick all took part in the consultation for the government’s draft domestic abuse and violence legislation. They are unclear as to whether CPV will make its first appearance in a domestic violence bill. And while there are benefits to it being included, such as raising its profile, Bonnick is wary about drawing too many parallels with adult abuse.“There is a problem with identifying with adult perpetrators because we might not want to get sucked into the sort of response that is considered appropriate for that. Children are still young and growing, and habits are not so fixed. There is much more hope for change.’Whole family protection Inclusion in the bill might, however, be a step towards families accessing the help they need.I am convinced that our own situation only changed because I started to call the police. Concerns followed about the welfare of my younger children. Our case was presented at the monthly Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (Marac), which put pressure on services to act. I was allocated an independent domestic violence advocate (Idva) from an organisation called Splitz, which offers support services to people experiencing domestic abuse. We met regularly and her support was crucial in keeping our case on the radar.Chrissy Stower, area manager for Splitz, says that while recognition of the problem has improved, there is still a long way to go.“The system is geared up for parent on child abuse, not the other way round,” she says. “This is seen as a ‘parenting’ issue with the child not being seen as being at risk from the parent. We have to expend a lot of energy in making the case to achieve support for child on parent abuse cases.”Condry agrees: “We’ve heard of families who have gone to social services and been told there’s no younger siblings in the family so it’s not a protection issue. We would argue very strongly that if a young person is being violent in the family there’s a massive safeguarding issue because he or she is not developing in a way they should be.”Condry is also clear that seeing CPV as a parenting issue is an over-simplification. “I am really reluctant to dwell on explanations that involve blaming parents,” she says. “There are so many complexities in families that this happens to.“It’s impossible to work with this by adjusting your behaviour, filling out a worksheet or trying to lay down boundaries,” she says. “That sort of thing is not going to work if someone has lived under siege for a couple of years.”“Burnout” is the phrase Condry says parents used often in her research to describe the impact of APV. At the family level, child to parent violence contributes to family breakdown, economic hardship and mental health problems.My relationship with Tom’s father did not survive our disagreements over how to handle him. As Tom’s violence and coercive behaviour became worse, I watched my other children fall apart, one began to behave self-destructively and the other withdrew further into his phone.I could barely work because I was getting so little sleep, and because Tom’s coercive behaviours took up so much time. I tried to visit my GP to talk about my own mental health, but all I could do was sob wordlessly. And all the while, I worried desperately about Tom – my inability to place boundaries meant that he was putting himself at risk, mixing with people who were exploiting him, and dabbling in drugs. “What medication are you on,” an attending police officer asked me one night. “None,” I replied. “Then how are you still standing?” he asked.And there is a wider social cost to consider. In research published in 2009, Syliva Walby, distinguished professor in sociology at the University of Lancaster, found that domestic violence and abuse cost the UK an estimated £15.7bn in 2008. If CPV is now as widespread as some people believe, then the associated costs to the economy will be significant.“You would imagine that if you did apply the economic cost of CPV and APV it would be massive,” says Condry. “Somebody who works in the youth justice field told me his suspicion was that a very large number of kids taken into care, especially in the 14-plus age range, would be due to family breakdown because of violence in the home,” she adds.Fund support services“There is a good case to be made for support services being funded to save a lot of money in the long run,” says Condry.It is clear to me that support services are not getting the funding they need now. I sensed frustration among the police officers attending us that they were working with blunt tools and being left to make difficult judgment calls. Emergency foster and respite centres had been closed, so they were faced with the tough choices of putting a vulnerable youth in a cell, sectioning him, or walking away.Tom was moved out of our home in the summer. My life now is radically different. I can work, I can even go out for the evening. But I still can’t sleep. Putting my child into care was searingly painful. I am often paralysed by recriminations, guilt and despair. I no longer look at baby pictures.Tom lives in his placement on the other side of our town. He is bewildered, angry and doesn’t properly understand why he is there. His capacity to make sense of what is happening to him is limited, and he is unable or unwilling to face up to his actions, leaving little room for us to repair our badly broken relationship.As Tom approaches adulthood, my influence over what happens to him will decline dramatically. I had always envisaged that I would house and care for him for as long as he needed me. Without my support, I fear greatly for his future – with it, I fear for mine.If you have been affected by the issues in this article, please visit holesinthewall or safelives.org.uk.

He found a seam and beat two Patriots to the corner of the end zone defensive back JC Jackson and tight end Rob Gronkowski, who was on the field as part of the Patriots’ prevent defense. The Dolphins’ bench emptied as teammates mobbed Drake.Tom Brady threw for 358 yards and three scores, but the stunned Patriots (9-4) lost in Miami for the fifth time in their past six visits. In the day’s later games the Steelers lost their third game in a row as they went down to the lowly Raiders. Elsewhere, the Cowboys boosted their playoff chances with victory over isional rivals the Eagles. The Chargers, Lions and 49ers beat the Bengals, Cardinals and Broncos respectively. Aaron Rodgers threw two touchdown passes and set an NFL record for interception-free football, and the Green Bay Packers beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-20 to win their first game under interim head coach Joe Philbin.Rodgers was 21 of 32 for 196 yards, including a 24-yard touchdown pass to Randall Cobb in the left side of the end zone for a 27-7. That throw gave Rodgers 359 consecutive attempts without an interception, breaking the league record previously held by New England’s Tom Brady (358 in 2010-11).Harrison Butker atoned for a 43-yard miss as time expired with a 36-yard field goal in overtime, and the Kansas City Chiefs stopped the Baltimore Ravens on fourth down to clinch a playoff spot with a 27-24 victory Sunday. The Chiefs (10-2) twice converted on fourth down before Patrick Mahomes threw a tying touchdown pass to Damien Williams with 53 seconds left. Moments later, Justin Houston strip-sacked Lamar Jackson to give Butker a chance to win the game for Kansas City in regulation. He missed that one. He didn’t miss his second chance.Saquon Barkley rushed for 170 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown to surpass 1,000 for the season, Eli Manning threw for three scores and the New York Giants routed the Redskins to effectively end Washington’s already-slim playoff hopes.The Giants intercepted new Washington quarterback Mark Sanchez twice with Curtis Riley scoring on a pick-six in the first quarter. It was Sanchez’s ninth career interception returned for a touchdown. Sanchez, making his first NFL start since 2015, was 6 of 14 for 38 yards and the two interceptions and didn’t have a completion longer than 10 yards. He was later benched for Josh Johnson.Drew Brees threw for one touchdown and ran another to help the New Orleans Saints rally from an 11-point halftime deficit to clinch their second straight NFC South title with a 28-14 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brees shrugged off a pair of turnovers to throw a TD pass to Zach Line, then scored on a one-yard sneak as the Saints (11-2) avenged a season-opening loss to Bucs (5-8) and also rebounded from a defeat last week at Dallas.Baker Mayfield outplayed Cam Newton, Jarvis Landry caught a touchdown pass and ran for another score and the Cleveland Browns damaged Carolina’s playoff hopes with a 26-20 win over the Panthers, who dropped their fifth straight.Mayfield bravely threw a 51-yard TD pass into traffic to Landry, who had a three-yard scoring run and added a long run on a similar call early in the fourth quarter to set up a go-ahead touchdown.Playing the spoiler role down the stretch, the Browns (5-7-1) improved to 3-2 under interim coach Gregg Williams, who needed just five games to match former Browns coach Hue Jackson’s win total over two-plus seasons. The Panthers (6-7) suffered a loss that could haunt them for months and will increase the heat on coach Ron Rivera.Andrew Luck threw for 399 yards and two touchdowns and TY Hilton had 199 receiving yards to lead the Indianapolis Colts to a road win over the Houston Texans. The Colts (7-6) snapped a nine-game winning streak by the Texans (9-4), trimming Houston’s lead over the AFC South to two games with three remaining. Houston cut Indianapolis’ lead to 24-21 with less than three minutes remaining. With the Colts facing a critical third-and-one at midfield, Luck drew Jadeveon Clowney offside to secure a first down and the win.Sam Darnold one-upped fellow rookie Josh Allen, rallying the New York Jets to a 27-23 win over the Buffalo Bills.Elijah McGuire scored on a fourth-and-goal run from the one with 1:17 remaining to cap a drive during which Darnold completed three of five passes for 52 yards. The rookie quarterback showed off his deft touch on a 37-yard pass to Robby Anderson, who made an over-the-shoulder catch up the right sideline. It was Darnold’s first career fourth-quarter comeback and came in his first game back after missing three with a strained right foot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb18eda121784fd923b4072d519575eb3798942a/0_120_3996_2398/master/3996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0554bff7228d09d4a2ff0ba35a1426a0","title":"resistance ends as india secure rare victory on australian soil in first test","story":"If there was a way to lose the first Test of the home summer and still exceed expectations, Tim Paine’s side did so in Adelaide. Sure, had they got over the line in their stoic final day run chase, they would be the toast of the nation. This isn’t that. But they do travel to Perth enhanced in belief and reputation, in no small part due to the way they conducted themselves throughout.“It was played in good spirits,” the Australian captain said of the 31-run defeat, that for about half an hour on the final afternoon was building to an epic conclusion before the last wicket fell. “Today was a nice snapshot of the way we want to go about it. We fought really hard and never gave in, you don’t have to talk rubbish and carry on like a pork chop to prove that.”After the year that has been for Australian cricket, they are words that ring true. Paine is ever mindful that the team he has inherited are far from the finished product and there is no glossing over the inexperience of the top six and their shortcomings in Adelaide. However, the path to becoming a serious contender is one that he can increasingly identify.“If you want to be a good team you have got to be hard to beat,” he said. “Today we were hard to beat. We made India work really hard. I think we made them work harder than they thought they were going to have to work. But sitting back now it is a huge opportunity because we didn’t cash in in the first innings.”Reducing the No 1-ranked team in the world to 41 for four on the opening morning, after being asked to field in blisteringly hot conditions, is evidence of that. Just as it was in Abu Dhabi in October, early gains from the bowling staff were not capitalised on. “We didn’t have batters out there when they were tiring,” he said. “It’s pretty hard to take.”As has often been the case over the last 12 months, Australia’s lower-order excelled with the bat, not least Nathan Lyon who finished the match with an unbeaten 38 to go with his 24 not out in the first innings. The off-spinner doubled down on his preparation with the blade over the winter months in Sydney with his brother Brendan, a professional batting coach. It paid off here just as it did in Dubai where he was instrumental to that impressive drawn effort.“Those four together you can see how much playing for Australia means to them,” Paine said of his bowlers. “Whether they’ve got the bat, ball, in the field, you can’t question the four guys’ commitment. They have a red hot crack for every single ball. That’s what we’re building to. That’s the style of cricket we want to play. They’re some of our more experienced players, I think the more they do that, the more it will rub off on the rest of this group.”Casting forward, concerns about Paine’s battered right index finger, which has been operated on seven times in the past and was struck again on the final day when batting, were assuaged. “It’s fine,” he replied succinctly when asked if it was going to prevent him from playing on Thursday. The squad, he reiterated, remains as named with no changes under consideration.Where a tweak could be made, however, is to the batting order. Before play, coach Justin Langer opened the door to Aaron Finch shuffling down to a position in the middle order with Usman Khawaja promoted back to the opening position where he excelled in Dubai. “We haven’t spoken about that just yet but Justin is the coach and he’s got a fair say so I imagine if he wants to talk about it it will be on the agenda when we get to Perth,” Paine noted.As for Shaun Marsh, his second-innings 60 may have been undone by a superb piece of bowling by Jasprit Bumrah not long before lunch – ending an innings that looked destined for three figures – but it didn’t detract from Paine’s pride in the maligned 35-year-old. “I just love the way that he keeps coming when everyone writes him off,” he said. “We spoke about it last night, he just keeps coming back and turning up and battling as hard as he possibly can and that can be really hard to do when you are always under the pump from you guys and always under the pump from the public and it just shows who strong a character he is.”Another man under the spotlight during the Test was Mitchell Starc after a ropey spell with the ball on Sunday. But there is no sign from Paine that his attack-leader will be demoted to first-change duties. “He didn’t set the world on fire but I think for a long time there’s been a really big gap between Starcy’s best and his worst and from what I’m seeing that is getting closer and closer every day,” he said. “So yeah was he at his best? Probably not, but I still thought he played his role really well.” He added: “In Perth, the conditions will suit him down to the ground. It will be swing and from what I’m hearing the wicket is going to be really fast.”In signing off, Paine forecast a tight overall result: “We’re in for a really tough four-match series and we expect it to be a real arm wrestle.” What’s certain is if they can find a way to keep this alive to Melbourne on Boxing Day or even Sydney, it will contribute a considerable amount to the healing of Cape Town."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55bfdd0697a38263d9f4fee03c9216817449da10/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c281e929c5ebaf6a32c675650b20b60","title":"heineken champions cup pools leinster saracens munster","story":"Munster set the early pace after a standout performance from JJ Hanrahan while Saracens look in ominous formThe two most successful sides in the tournament’s history are in charge of the pool. Much is made of the regular rest given to Ireland’s leading players but it seemed to contribute to Leinster’s slow start at a pumped-up Bath. Outmanoeuvred at the breakdown and with Johnny Sexton having no time, the holders still found a way to win. Bath need to repeat Northampton’s 2013 feat against Leinster when they followed a home defeat with an away victory to remain alive but Wasps are on their way out after defeat by Toulouse. Like Bath, they have one win since September and the looming Premiership match between the sides holds more significance than Europe. Paul ReesMunster have control of the pool, three points clear of Gloucester and are yet to lose. Despite the home win over Castres yesterday, they will anticipate a tougher test in France on Saturday. Gloucester will hope to regain ground on Munster on Friday in the return against Exeter, having upset them at Sandy Park on Saturday. For Munster and Gloucester there were huge positives beyond the wins. Munster had two late withdrawals, including Joey Carbery. JJ Hanrahan came in for Carbery and was man of the match. Gloucester showed their coach, Johan Ackermann, what he wanted after being convincingly beaten at Exeter two weeks ago – patience and persistence. Claire TolleySaracens are romping towards a home quarter-final after one of those second-half surges that are fast becoming their trademark. Mark McCall was again lamenting a sluggish first half in a match they ended up winning at a canter but the truth is they have far too much firepower when playing at home for all but a handful of European sides. They are unbeaten since the Champions Cup defeat by Leinster in April and there can be little doubt Saracens are desperate to ensure their last-eight match is at Allianz Park this time. McCall’s side look certain to all but secure qualification in Cardiff on Saturday. They may not be the holders but Saracens are still setting the pace. Gerard MeagherAnother defeat for Leicester but this was a definite improvement on their Premiership disintegration at Bristol. There was far more fighting spirit and, despite two sin-binnings and a lop-sided penalty count, Geordan Murphy was encouraged. The next trick is to stop conceding tries. “We’re conceding tries but my defensive coach Brett Deacon is an unbelievable coach and he’s doing a great job,” said Murphy. “He’s giving the right messages … the players are saying it’s on them, they’re just not doing the things they’ve been asked.” The bigger picture, however, is stark: lose at home to Racing on Sunday and Leicester’s European campaign will again be over prematurely. Robert KitsonIf someone had asked you a couple of years ago to guess the pecking order of this pool at halfway you would almost certainly have gone with the exact reverse. Toulon, thrice champions and overflowing with stars Montpellier, pretty much their equal budget-wise daylight relegation-haunted Newcastle Edinburgh. How refreshing to see otherwise. Edinburgh continue their contribution to the revival of Scottish fortunes and Newcastle have become Premiership semi-finalists. And here they dominate two French clubs. Sunday’s face-off between the two at Kingston Park will determine who goes into the final two rounds in pole position. Michael AylwinThree counterattacking efforts stood out: Frans Steyn’s for Montpellier in Toulon after a 70-yard move, Matthew Morgan’s solo score for Cardiff Blues at Saracens and, trumping them, Heinz’s against Exeter from Ollie Thorley’s break when the wing double-stepped two defenders.No longer in the Champions Cup, Italian teams are not propping up tables. Treviso’s victory over Quins took them top of Challenge Cup Pool 5 and Zebre are second in Pool 4. Less is proving more.\u0026nbspThe length of an advantage is like a piece of string. Referees play on for several phases when a penalty offence has been committed but for a minor infringement advantage tends to last one phase. Leinster’s crucial try came after Bath’s James Wilson threw a risky pass thinking advantage was being played. It had ended shortly after it had started.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32e882fed7a4137da3d875ce40c33e62ce1f8430/0_135_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc596d02914913d7d8ed572f57bd07b7","title":"andrea dunbar playwright life story bradford rita sue bob too","story":"New drama Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile looks back at the life of the playwright who wrote Rita, Sue and Bob TooA new drama is to revisit the life and early death of Andrea Dunbar, the playwright who became a sensation with Rita, Sue and Bob Too, a dark comedy inspired by the Yorkshire housing estate where she lived. The play, written by Lisa Holdsworth, will be staged in a pub in Dunbar’s native Bradford in May next year. It is adapted from Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile, Adelle Stripe’s strikingly atmospheric novel about Dunbar, which captures Dunbar’s experience of poverty and abuse, her quick wit and her flair as a playwright. Holdsworth says her adaptation doesn’t give a voice to the men who mistreated Dunbar but instead focuses on “women’s relationships and how they quietly get on with things and get things done”.Stripe’s novel was acclaimed on publication in 2017. Its title was borrowed from a description of Dunbar in a Mail on Sunday article that dubbed her “a genius straight from the slums”. The book primarily tells Dunbar’s story in the third person and sparingly imagines events from her point of view. Holdsworth, who has previously written for the TV shows Emmerdale and Ackley Bridge, says that her stage adaptation will be “Andrea telling her story”.“We made the decision fairly early on that it would be Andrea’s voice throughout. We didn’t want to put the various men who treated her badly across the years on stage – or to hear their voices. It’s very much from her perspective and from the women in her life who helped her along the way.”A cast of five will share the roles, with two actors playing young and older versions of Dunbar. The play charts how she shot to fame as a teenager with The Arbor, an autobiographical drama about a pregnant girl and her alcoholic father. It started as a school assignment, written in green Biro on pages torn from an exercise book, and was submitted to the Royal Court’s Young Writers festival. Dunbar became the youngest writer to have a play staged at the Royal Court when it opened there in 1980, directed by Max Stafford-Clark. It was followed by Rita, Sue and Bob Too (1982), about the sexual relationship between two teenage babysitters and a married man, and a third and final play, Shirley (1986).Dunbar died after suffering a brain haemorrhage in 1990 at the age of 29. She collapsed in her local pub, the Beacon, where she had often written and sought inspiration for her work. Commissioned by Freedom Studios, Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile will open at the Ambassador pub, in Sunbridge Road, Bradford, on 30 May. It will then tour to theatres, including dates at Cast in Doncaster and Oldham Coliseum. The decision to put it on first in a pub, says Holdsworth, was to show how “those places were a hub for communities – not always in a positive way, as gossip got passed around and conflicts would flare up – but for collective moments”.One of the women portrayed on stage in Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile will be the writer Kay Mellor, who knew and encouraged both Holdsworth and Dunbar. Holdsworth worked as Kay’s PA for several months before writing for Mellor’s TV series Fat Friends.Holdsworth grew up in Pudsey, which is between Leeds and Bradford, and read Dunbar’s plays at school. As a teenager, she watched Alan Clarke’s film of Rita, Sue and Bob Too: “It was one of those videos that got passed round as being a bit naughty. It got quoted a lot at school.” But Dunbar was unhappy with the depiction of her characters and of the estate in Clarke’s film. Holdsworth says that Dunbar had an “eternal frustration” with the way her community was represented in a negative light. When she lived away from the estate, she was “always desperate to get back to Buttershaw,” says Holdsworth. “That community was important to her. She wanted to represent it – and people got in the way of her representing it.”Dunbar stood out in the 1980s because she was a young, female, working-class voice. Holdsworth doesn’t believe things are any better for today’s Dunbars. “In TV, which should be a natural place for working-class writers, it’s just appalling. That feeling of the lack of representation. That’s why it’s so exciting that Channel 4 are coming to Leeds. You hope that they’ll hear voices in their authentic place of being and will want to represent that on screen.”As Stripe’s book makes clear, Dunbar’s talent was nurtured at school by a teacher who spotted her potential. “Andrea had a teacher who saw a talent that couldn’t be measured in CSE marks and they developed that talent,” says Holdsworth, who criticises our “obsession with exam results” today. “I don’t think that would happen now. There aren’t the resources or the time for teachers to single out someone with a unique talent.”Last year, there was controversy when the Royal Court initially cancelled a revival of Rita, Sue and Bob Too as the reverberations of #MeToo were felt throughout the theatre industry and it was revealed that Max Stafford-Clark, who had championed Dunbar and first directed the play in 1982, was ousted from his company Out of Joint in 2017 over allegations of inappropriate behaviour.After an outcry, the revival was subsequently reinstated. But Holdsworth believes that the subsequent critical response to the play “mirrored what had gone on the first time the play came out”, with reviewers suggesting that “it’s all a bit unseemly”. Her play, says Holdsworth, will let Dunbar “speak for herself to a certain extent and redress the balance. I’m honoured that Freedom Studios are giving me the chance. I certainly feel the weight of the responsibility on me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff9f903813d0b123e7015d2fb21bdd394aabba4/0_46_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003ab1423400f089aa13ca3092610eda","title":"how hot dogs got haute fashions fast food love in","story":"From the humble grilled cheese sandwich to classic burger and fries, Anna Hart discovers how comfort food is getting a luxury makeover as part of our everyday extraordinary series. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3A decade ago, grabbing a burger was a quick fix, something we did when we were short of cash, time or imagination. For modern diners, going for a burger is a quest. A quest for excellence: gastronomic, ethical and aesthetic excellence. In cities around the globe, dishes that would once have been termed fast food – pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, tacos and hot dogs – are being taken as an art form, with fiercely loyal cult followings on social media and five-star newspaper reviews by food critics previously accustomed to starchy tablecloths and foamy, fiddly haute cuisine offerings. On Twitter and other social media platforms, diners furiously debate the merits of a Bleecker burger over a Patty \u0026amp Bun burger on the Mexican front, Breddos and DF Mexico vie for the crown of best tacos in London, and the gloves are off between devotees of Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.This is the golden age of flash food – poshed-up fast food – when the most sought-after meals around the UK are sophisticated versions of simple staples.“I think haute cuisine has been put in its place,” says chef Gizzi Erskine, author of Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over. “We now take comfort in simple dishes that mean something to us, that may have been pushed to another level from technique and ingredients. Plus, we care much more about the ingredients – provenance, breed and how things are farmed – so there’s a new understanding that a great piece of meat cooked simply is enough.”A menu is one of the most telling barometers of any society, indicating our shifting aspirations, economic circumstances, ethical and health preoccupations and how we choose to socialise. “This is definitely a sociological trend as much as about food tastes,” says Damien Gabet, editor of Square Meal magazine. “It’s no longer cool to shout about that Michelin-starred meal you ate off starched tablecloths, but there’s cultural capital to be gained from going out and Instagramming a meal from the most hyped food truck in town.”Social media has significantly fuelled the trend for superlative versions of simple dishes. “Fine-dining fare doesn’t actually photograph that well and generally looks fussy and drab,” says Gabet. “Whereas, dishes such as tacos and burgers have distinct outlines and vibrant colours.”In London, few figures have done more to champion affordable new restaurants, informal supper clubs and food trucks than Clerkenwell Boy, an anonymous food influencer with close to 200,000 followers on Instagram (@Clerkenwell_Boy). “I started Instagramming to try and make food more accessible and less elitist,” he says. “Because, while there is a place for special-occasion fine-dining, on a Tuesday night with friends, we generally want affordable but delicious meals served family-style, in a no-frills setting but with relaxed and friendly service.”And while we might be dining out more, this doesn’t mean we’re lowering our standards. “If we go out for a burger, we want it to be the best burger in town,” says Clerkenwell Boy. “We want to eat simply, but we want it to be the absolute best version of that dish.”As Trish Caddy, Mintel’s senior foodservice analyst, puts it: “Millennials – the generation most likely to consider themselves as ‘foodies’ – have developed an acquired taste for artisanal flavours such as dry-aged meats and smoked cheese, partly out of a desire for visceral, intense experiences that stimulate their senses.”And although consumers are increasingly health-conscious, there’s also been a shift in what we consider an “unhealthy” meal. Burgers and pizzas are no longer demonised there’s a new understanding that excessive sugar, sweeteners, additives and heavy processing are the real culprits in poor health and obesity.“So, instead of eating low-quality processed meats such as fatty pepperoni and sausages, millennials are seeking out functional ingredients like fermented foods that tap into the ongoing gut-friendly food trend,” says Caddy. “For example, sourdough pizzas, which feature purported health benefits that come from the fermentation process, have a distinctive sourness compared to ordinary pizza bread dough. This suits millennials, who have grown accustomed to food with intensive flavours as well as health benefits.”And if diners are rediscovering simple pleasures, the good news is that these dishes are also immensely satisfying to prepare. “Cooking should be about everything from sourcing great ingredients to the therapeutic rituals of breaking down the recipes,” says Erskine. “And everyone should be able to eat, and cook, this way.”The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete.

Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now.

I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place. It is a part of Peckham that not many people know exists. The lavender is beautiful and it’s where I sit and think everyday.Discover a local secretPeckham has a golf course! Aquarius Golf Club is massive and nearer the Honor Oak side. You wouldn’t know about it unless you’re from Peckham.When you’re finished in Peckham …Take the Overground to citizenM Hotel, Shoreditch – it’s my favourite spot to meet people in London, partly because it has a really cute balcony, epic music and the coziest ambience.The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

From rethinking your routine to noticing art and culture around you, as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, here are 10 ways to appreciate the magic of the everyday. All images captured on Google Pixel 3Most of us are settled into our routines. Wake up, check emails, grab a coffee, hop on the train, get to work. It’s not our fault, it’s the efficient way that our brains work. “Having this autopilot mode allows the conscious mind to be freed up for other tasks,” says Gemma Griffith, a director at the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at Bangor University.However, autopilot mode can have its downsides. By being so wedded to our ingrained habits and routine we can risk becoming disconnected from other people and our surroundings, and missing out on everyday magic. For Griffith the remedy is simple: “It’s about switching back to ‘being’ mode rather than ‘doing’ mode and focusing our attention on the present moment”. Here are 10 ways to shake up your routine and relish the everyday.Take time outYou don’t have to trek to the top of a mountain to find inner peace. Whether you’re on your commute or taking a lunchtime stroll, take the time to open up your awareness. “Focus on your walking, how your feet feel on the ground, the temperature of the weather at that moment, and the sounds you hear,” says Griffith. Coax your mind into the present moment by taking a different route home or trying out a new lunch spot.Be more basicFashion’s love affair with utilitarian dressing continues, with pared-back basics the lynchpins of Instagram’s most followed fashion icons. “The current appetite for streetwear and the rise of high-street stores that specialise in stocking classic key items, such as brands like Arket, prove that the trend for basics is going nowhere,” says stylist Laura Martin. The humble white t-shirt, the classic hoodie and ordinary gym trainers have never been more on trend. The good news is, they’re probably already in your wardrobe.Rethink your favourite foodsThe internet has turned eating into an art form. While home chefs could once have lived a lifetime using only Mrs Beeton’s Cookery Book for company, today we are googling ambitious dishes then feverishly photographing and hashtagging the results. But have we forgotten the simple pleasure of ordinary meals and ingredients? As the zeitgeist turns towards a balanced approach to eating, bloggers such as the Ugly Vegan are performing the seemingly revolutionary act of sharing unfiltered, familiar dishes. For your next evening in, why not grab a bag of imperfect veg and create something extraordinarily ordinary?Notice art around youYou don’t have to go to a gallery to appreciate great art and design: seek out signs of creativity all around you. If you’re in London, look up Art on the Underground’s Brixton mural map, leading to examples of street art in the area dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Manchester? Check out the street art tours on offer by writer Hayley Flynn, who set up bespoke tours of the city to put a spotlight on the local landscape of the Northern Quarter, which is packed with rich history. Over in Bristol, the tourist office has published free, downloadable walking tours of Banksy’s work.Discover hidden librariesFrom repurposed old red phone boxes to shelves at the train station, hidden libraries are popping up everywhere. The literary scheme Read Now, Write Now has teamed up to create book exchange shelves along the Wirral train line, and Clapham North tube station in London has a book swap shelf located at its entrance. Over in Crossmichael in southern Scotland and Amberley in Stroud, locals have turned their old phone boxes into mini libraries. The pleasure in these new makeshift lending libraries? “You get to discover new gems,” says Fruzsina Bekefi who runs a monthly book swap out of east London reading nook Libreria. “It’s a great way to widen my horizons and inject a bit of serendipity into my life.”Find a new perspective There are more than 4m posts for #lookup on Instagram and with good reason: from intricate architecture to stunning skies, there’s so much you could miss if you keep your eyes trained on the ground. And as we shuffle along our daily tramlines, our thinking can get stuck in a rut too. Head up a hillside or tall building for a fresh look at where you live, or mix up your commute by getting off a stop or two early and walking the rest of the way.Discover hidden historyWhether you are a fan of poets, musicians, athletes or writers, it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for the English Heritage blue plaque scheme. The plaques dotted around London point out where notable creatives lived in the city, from children’s author AA Milne to the black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The English heritage scheme has also influenced other local areas across the UK to celebrate their histories, too – so look out for blue plaques in Brighton and Hove, South Tyneside and Leeds (thanks to the local Leeds Civic Trust).Shake up your workoutIf your idea of exercise is headphones and a running machine, why not break the habit and explore a more sociable way to exercise? GoodGym hosts running meet-ups across the UK, combining fitness with an activity that benefits the local community. Jog to meet an isolated elderly person, sort out cans at a food bank or pitch in to tidy someone’s garden. A recent study from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US proved that team exercise can lower stress and improve quality of life.Appreciate moreBusy doesn’t have to equal stress – it’s all about how you approach it, says Griffith. “Do a routine activity mindfully, whether that is brushing your teeth or eating breakfast in the morning, by adjusting your senses to what you are doing,” she says. The benefits of mindfulness are worth it. “It’s a practise that lowers the stress hormone cortisol. It encourages those who apply mindfulness to their daily lives to have more compassion for themselves and others,” says Griffith.Get back to natureGwyneth Paltrow’s love of grounding has been well documented (and much maligned), but how about a spot of forest bathing? This new nature buzzword refers to a rising trend in green spaces inspired by a Japanese tradition. Try it by heading to your local forest or woodland trail and soaking up everything you see, touch, hear and smell. Even if you can’t make it that far afield, swap that “al desko” lunch for some much needed vitamin D – it’s the perfect pick-me-up when daylight hours are in such short supply.The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

He starred as Lando Calrissian in Solo: A Star Wars Story, and he announced his departure from the animated Deadpool series by releasing a satirical script mocking Hollywood’s tone-deaf tendencies on race. He later produced the most talked-about music video in years for This Is America. But arguably his most impressive feat was following up the first season of Atlanta, his quirky examination of African American life, with something just as ambitious and odd.Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) – the on-the-cusp-of-making-it rapper who seems to be in a constant state of incredulity – spends most of the second series being mugged while running into his city’s strangest residents. There’s comedian Katt Williams playing Alligator Man, an urban myth come to life. The episode Barbershop features Bibby, a flakey coiffeur intent on doing anything other than cutting hair. Then, of course, there is Teddy Perkins, the Michael Jackson-like recluse who Darius (Lakeith Stanfield) encounters while picking up an organ in an episode that hits similar notes to Jordan Peele’s Get Out.A sense of unease permeates throughout, as hinted at by the show’s subtitle, Robbin’ Season, which refers to the period before Christmaswhen robberies in Atlanta spike as people cash in on other people’s yuletide splurges. “You might get your package stolen off your front porch. While we were there, my neighbour got her car stolen from her driveway,” explained Stephen Glover, brother of Donald and a writer on Atlanta. “It’s a very tense and desperate time. Our characters are in a desperate transition from their old lives to where they’re headed now. And robbin’ season is a metaphor to where we are now.”Glover and his writing team shared a Slack channel where they would send each other memes, viral videos and news stories that caught their attention. From there, ideas were turned into stories that Henry, Glover and crew played out. They definitely saw the viral video posted on Facebook in 2016 by an outraged suburban mother who had just heard the Vince Staples song Norf Norf and cried as she recited the line “Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions”. They pulled that apart in acerbic fashion. An episode starts with a white woman reciting Paper Boi’s lyrics (“Shout-out Colin Kaepernick!”) while crying, which the crew credit with giving them more radio play. It is typically dismissive and irreverent, and you get the feeling Glover and co don’t want to get bogged down in the earnest art of “explaining black culture to white America” like some of their other contemporaries have.The unusual pacing means they get to explore more interesting terrain. There is a flashback episode to Earn’s youth (FUBU), a trip to an Oktoberfest beer hall (Helen), a disastrous gig on a college campus (North of the Border). But the series standout, along with Teddy Perkins, is Woods, an episode ostensibly about what happens to Paper Boi after a date goes awry and he ends up being mugged, again. But as he escapes into a forest the episode transforms into something between the Pine Barrens episode of The Sopranos, Under the Skin and A Midsummer Night’s Dream as Paper Boi is chased by a very persistent hobo.Glover said the series was inspired by the animated Tiny Toons film How I Spent My Vacation. “It’s a whole story, but told in a bunch of little parts,” he said. Atlanta continues to be greater than the sum of its parts, taking a story about a rapper and his lacklustre manager and turning it into a surreal experiment that acts as a measured critique of contemporary America and internet culture."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79d2b89de0ad5aef3798d87a37a857bf1a9fdf2e/0_42_3307_1984/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a56a4d449a4571e7df71c716e94bf5d6","title":"turncoat game of thrones characters most likely to survive researchers say","story":"Based on deaths so far, Australian health academics say those with the best prognosis have previously switched allegianceResearchers in Australia have calculated the key indicators of survival in the final season of HBO’s Game of Thrones, based on a study of the cause of death of all 186 characters that met their fate in the first seven seasons of the show.The study, published in the journal Injury Epidemiology on Monday and available online, found that characters with the greatest chance of survival were prominent characters who had switched allegiance at least once, with lesser determining factors being that both female characters and characters that were highborn tended to live longer.That would put Cersei Lannister, currently installed on the Iron Throne, in a good position to survive the series.It also, says co-author Reidar Lystad, a research fellow with the Australian Institute of Health Innovation at Macquarie University in Sydney, applies to sisters Sansa and Arya Stark, although some fans would object to the suggestion Arya ever truly switched allegiances.Daenerys Targaryen, the one with the dragons, has not switched allegiances and therefore stands a higher likelihood of dying in season eight.Jon Snow switched allegiances to Daenerys in season seven, slightly reducing his chance of dying, although he has already died once. Bran Stark could be said to have switched allegiances to become the Three-Eyed Raven. Jaime Lannister, last seen abandoning his sisterlover and riding north, could also see his chances of survival going up, and Tyrion Lannister was already a turncoat.To compile the data, Lystad and his co-author Ben Brown, a fellow Macquarie University academic, rewatched all 67 episodes of the first seven seasons of the show and noted the number of important characters, when they were introduced, whether they died, how they died and how much time they spent on screen before dying.They were then demographically categorised as high or lowborn, “silk collar workers” versus “boiled leather collar workers”, and by their stated religion.An important character was defined as a human (no White Walkers or direwolves) listed in either the opening or closing credits who did not appear only in a flashback.Non-credited characters were bumped up to important characters if they interacted with another character in an important way.About a third died in their home.The shortest-lived character was Olly’s father, who was shot dead by Ygritte just 11 seconds after first appearing on screen in season four, episode three.His death motivated his son, Olly, to kill Ygritte and later join in the fatal stabbing of Jon.Ygritte is included in the death data as one of 11 killed by assault by other specified sharp object, in this case an arrow. Jon Snow’s death was not counted because it didn’t stick. According to an algorithm created by students at the Technical University of Munich in 2016, he should never have died at all.“What we did with these characters that have been resurrected – and Jon Snow is just one of them – is if they come back to life and feature in the show, then we have not counted them as being actually or really dead,” Lystad said. “So they fall in the alive category, at least for now.”The longest surviving characters are Jon Snow and Bran Stark, who have been alive for 57 hours and 15 minutes.Lystad and Brown included several tips for the showrunners to decrease the rate of violent deaths in the show based on real-world historical factors that are linked to declining death rate, including focus on commerce over conflict, increased investment in institutions that improve public health and wellbeing like schools and hospitals, improving the built environment, and developing evidence-based violence prevention policies.But Lystad admitted that would not necessarily make for an exciting show.“I don’t think they will take me up on that,” he said.Game of Thrones season eight will air on HBO in April 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1439e189bd4ba8202d45c63f2afa576826daf55/0_132_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80655a7fe1bf84d4eccc6fb7bb8a7cf6","title":"jamal khashoggi mohammed bin salman jared kushner","story":"Khashoggi, a journalist and critic of the Saudi regime, was a Saudi national resident in the US who wrote for the Washington Post. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. His body is believed to have been dismembered.Citing the importance of the Saudis as allies, and standing contrary to the conclusions of the CIA, Donald Trump and his aides have steadfastly refused to say Prince Mohammed was responsible for Khashoggi’s death. The White House has levied sanctions against 17 Saudi iniduals deemed to have been involved.Prince Mohammed is the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Its government has given contradictory explanations for the death and denied the prince knew of it.Rubio backed a Senate resolution on the matter that was introduced on Wednesday. The other Republican sponsors were Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Todd Young of Indiana. The Democrats were Dianne Feinstein of California, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Chris Coons of Delaware.The resolution says Prince Mohammed is “complicit” in and should be “held accountable” for the “abhorrent and unjustified murder”. It also says the prince has contributed to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, the blockade of Qatar and the “jailing and torture of dissidents and activists”.The administration has acknowledged one call between the two men since Khashoggi’s disappearance, on 9 October and joined by national security adviser John Bolton. Citing “American officials and a Saudi briefed on their conversations”, the Times said Kushner and Prince Mohammed have “continued to chat informally”.Citing the unnamed Saudi source, the paper said, “Kushner has offered the crown prince advice about how to weather the storm, urging him to resolve his conflicts around the region and avoid further embarrassments”.Rubio was asked if such White House behaviour constituted a defence of American values. He said he couldn’t say if the Times story was accurate, but added: “This story is as much about America as it is about Khashoggi. Obviously what happened to that man was terrible, but it’s also about who we are as a nation.“This is a crown prince that is a reckless inidual,” he said. “He’s going to continue to test the boundaries of what he can get away with internationally and within our alliance, until those boundaries are set.”He added: “As a nation we cannot say that if our allies do something horrifying, we’re going to look away.”In an interview with the Atlantic published on Friday, the outgoing United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley said the US would not give the Saudis “a pass” and said that as Prince Mohammed’s “government did this … so he technically is responsible”. She added that “the administration needs to decide” what steps it will take.On Sunday, Rubio was asked if he thought Haley’s nominated replacement, former Fox News host and state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, was qualified for such a senior job.He told CBS’s Face the Nation he thought “she has the ability to do the job well”. But he added: “Does she have detailed knowledge of foreign policy to a level that will allow her to be successful at the United Nations? I don’t know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f92c827e079d59272fde9fa7535f4d73dc6ba1a6/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffe9b3c98ca98a20a3841688d45e7806","title":"italian priests vow to open church doors to evictees from immigration centres","story":"‘Salvini decree’ threatens to make thousands not eligible for refugee status homelessItalian priests have declared their willingness to “open the church doors of every single parish” to people expelled from reception centres as an anti-immigration law from Italy’s rightwing government threatens to make thousands homeless.The so-called “Salvini decree” – named after Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and leader of the far-right League – left hundreds in legal limbo when its removal of humanitarian protection for those not eligible for refugee status but otherwise unable to return home was applied by several Italian cities soon after its approval by parliament earlier this month.The Catholic church expressed its profound disapproval immediately after the vote.The Vatican’s position is “very clear”, its secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said last week. “You don’t leave migrants in the street … A profound sense of solidarity must prevail. You cannot put people in this position. You must always focus on people and their rights.”According to Italy’s ministry of the interior, between 2016 and 2017 Italy provided humanitarian protection to 39,145 asylum seekers, who under the Salvini decree risk being made homeless within weeks.In early December, a letter announcing the expulsion of 50 people was sent to the reception centre in Mineo, Sicily: the largest in Europe after the Moria camp in Greece. The bishop of Caltagirone, Monsignor Calogero Peri, said he was prepared to provide 40 beds in nearby facilities owned by the church to welcome people who risk expulsion.“And if there are not enough beds? I have already spoken with other bishops: we will open the church doors of every single parish under our control,” he said. “It’s not a question of politics. It’s a matter of protecting iniduals. Imagine this: in Italy now it is a crime to abandon dogs, but it is not a crime to abandon people. Even worse, abandoning men, women and children is now the law.”That the Catholic church would have to bear the brunt of taking in increasing numbers of migrants was expected back in August, when Salvini blocked the arrival on Italian soil of 177 migrants onboard the Italian coastguard vessel Ubaldo Diciotti.Salvini forced the migrants, for the most part Eritreans, to remain onboard the ship for more than a week until other EU nations had agreed to take them. In the end, the church put an end to the crisis by pledging to provide assistance to 100 migrants who were being held on the ship. “The church has opened its heart and its wallet,” Salvini said.When police arrived at the reception centre in the southern Italian province of Crotone to force out a Nigerian family and their six-month-old baby, Father Rino Le Pera, the regional director of the Catholic charity Caritas, drove them himself to a new home.“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” he told the . “They were about to put a six-month-old child on the street. Six months old! Can you imagine? When they told me, I drove right the way there with my car and found a place for the family. If necessary, I would have made my own home available for them.”The 24 asylum-seekers in Isola Capo Rizzuto were the first migrants expelled after the approval of the Salvini decree. “We are prepared for the worst and made already available beds and rooms run by the church in Crotone when the authorities will expel more migrants from the reception centres,” says Rino.According to data provided by the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI) and published in the Catholic inspired daily Avvenire, the church has already taken in 25,000 migrants in its facilities since 2017, financed in part by EU funds allocated for refugees and forwarded to the ministry of the interior whereas about 2,700 asylum seekers have been assisted under Vatican funding alone.In the Ballarò neighbourhood of Palermo, Father Enzo Volpe, a Salesian priest, has spent the last seven years in the streets of the Sicilian city in prayer alongside Nigerian sex workers and victims of sex trafficking, such as Blessing, a Nigerian girl expelled from the welcome centre in Isola Capo Rizzuto.“Leaving these girls in the street, victims of sex trafficking, is not only inhumane, it also means facilitating the work of criminal organisations,” he told the . “With no protection, these girls risk becoming easy prey for Italian criminal organisations.”Italian priests are no strangers to adopting strong-armed measures. In the small Tuscan town of Vicofaro, in the province of Pistoia, Father Massimo Biancalani has welcomed migrants in the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, where he has provided beds and sleeping bags for dozens of people who spent the night inside the parish.Massimo incurred the wrath of Salvini, but Pope Francis sent a letter of solidarity to the priest. “Keep taking people in. I’m with you,” he wrote.

With little sign any of them plan to change their position, the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, has warned that the whole of the UK could be scarred by isions, similar to the historic ides that have riven Northern Ireland. “When the dust settles on Brexit, we must move forward in order that we can put some of the ision about the nature of our country’s relationship with the European Union behind us,” she writes in the .The European court of justice is likely to rule today that it is possible for the UK to unilaterally revoke article 50. No 10 sees this as a useful ruling, which could be used to help it make the case to rebellious MPs that Brexit itself is at risk.On the left, a new coalition has emerged, urging Labour to reject Brexit. The remain-supporting coalition of Momentum activists, local party chairs and Labour councillors is trying to persuade the Labour leadership to ditch a commitment to Brexit in any snap election manifesto.Meanwhile, a pair of hedge funds owned by prominent Brexit supporters have made significant bets against companies exposed to the British consumer, including big high street names.

Ardern said there was a collective feeling of shame in her country over the fate of Millane, whose body was found on Sunday in dense bushland in western Auckland. “There is this overwhelming sense of hurt and shame that this has happened in our country, a place that prides itself on our hospitality, on our manaakitanga,” she said, using the Maori word for welcoming others. “So on behalf of New Zealand, I want to apologise to Grace’s family – your daughter should have been safe here and she wasn’t, and I’m sorry for that.” Her sentiments were echoed on social media with the hashtag #HerLightOurLove trending on Twitter. The 26-year-old accused cannot be named for legal reasons has been remanded in custody.Macron to address nation – The embattled French PM will address the country tonight after a fourth weekend of violence sparked by the gilets jaunes movement. His speech at 8pm local time will be his first public comments on the anti-government demonstrations. “It is clear that we underestimated people’s need to make themselves heard,” government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told a radio station on Sunday. As well as destructive protests in Paris, violence also broke out at gilets jaunes demonstrations in Marseille, Bordeaux, Lyon, Nantes, Dijon and Toulouse on the weekend.Crossrail delays – The new, high-capacity train line across London could swallow up another £1bn in funding and be delayed beyond 2019, ministers are expected to admit this week. The flagship construction project had originally been due to be opened on the weekend by the Queen, but problems with complex new signalling systems delayed testing trains in the central core.Climate change or crash – Global investors managing $32tn have issued a stark warning to governments at the UN climate summit in Poland, demanding urgent cuts in carbon emissions and the phasing out of all coal burning. Without these, the world faces a financial crash several times worse than the 2008 crisis, they said.

Despite the presence of several seats of learning here I continue to be surprised at the absence of any serious scholarship tracking the step changes happening before our eyes.Recently, I listened to former Democratic Unionist Party first minister Peter Robinson when he gave a speech to the Knock Methodist Centre in East Belfast. Later, some of those in the audience told me they are now learning Irish.Let us not exaggerate the numbers of those in the Protestant community who are doing so, but their actions are in contrast to the crass denigration of the language by some in the DUP, such as party leader Arlene Foster or Gregory Campbell.Once upon a time, Peter Robinson might have agreed, or did agree with such views. But he grew comfortable during his years in government dealing with “crocodiles” such as Martin McGuinness and fellow Sinn Féin Irish-speaking personnel, unlike his colleagues.Can you imagine Robinson’s thoughts on the Irish language as he watched his colleagues letting the issue of the treatment of it lead to the collapse last February of a deal that would have restored the Stormont institutions.Speaking at the Knock Methodist Centre, he said: “I couldn’t care less about the Irish Language. Let them speak it until they are green, white and orange in the face, as long as it doesn’t encroach on me. This was ‘such a small issue’ – smaller than, say, the devolution of policing and justice and, before that, agreeing the conditions for that Paisley-McGuinness Executive.”The DUP incontrovertibly reached a deal in February with Sinn Féin. Equally, it is incontrovertible that the DUP later resiled from that deal, leaving former ministers and its negotiators, Edwin Poots and Simon Hamilton, exposed and potentially damaged.The bona fides of the secret agreement, which Brian Rowan I reported on in Eamonn Mallie. com in the days after the collapse of the talks, were contemptuously challenged by Jeffrey Donaldson, Foster and Campbell.However, it is time to nail the big lie peddled by the DUP that Sinn Féin was responsible for collapsing the February 9th negotiations because of what the DUP call Sinn Féin’s “red lines” on the Irish language.Instead, the DUP negotiating team had bought into an agreement that embraced the Irish language. Initially, it had Foster’s blessing. Indeed, top Irish and British officials returned home that Friday evening confident the deal was in the bag.The DUP grassroots rose up over the weekend when news broke that British prime minister Theresa May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar were due at Stormont on Monday, February 12th, to give the emerging agreement their imprimatur.During that weekend, Foster was overwhelmed by forces in her own party, including one DUP MP who told me that he took “one look” at the document after he returned from London and told the negotiators “it won’t fly with the grassroots”. The MP said it was impossible for the party to sell a package that better acknowledged the place of the Irish language given that the DUP leadership had run a campaign of abuse against it for nearly two years.The leadership panicked and the rest is history. Merrion Street in Dublin and Downing Street were left speechless on Wednesday, February 14th, after Foster tweeted: “In our view there is no current prospect of the discussions leading to an Executive being formed.”During his speech to the Knock Methodist Centre, Robinson drove a horse and coaches through the DUP leadership’s contestable history of what had happened during those days in February.“I wish the draft agreement that unravelled in February had been leaked earlier,” he said. Robinson argued that many of the fears wrongly raised in advance about quotas in the Civil Service having to speak Irish and Irish language street signs everywhere, proved groundless.The damage done then to the working relationship in February between the DUP and Sinn Féin may prove to be irreparable, certainly in the short to long term. Indeed, it could be argued that Sinn Féin has every reason to sit and wait.The United Kingdom’s impending Brexit from the European Union and the bitterly-contested withdrawal agreement May concluded with the EU27 in Brussels, should it stick, might discourage Sinn Féin from returning to Stormont.Republicans could interpret that the agreement’s terms are a tinkering with, or fracturing of, the place of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that this is something positive and not to be discouraged.This point has to be tempered, however, by an acceptance that the deal agreed by May is surprisingly favourable to Northern Ireland, when viewed solely through economic eyes. Such a deal was considered illusory by nationalists at the outset.The confidence and supply agreement between the Conservatives and the DUP keeping May in power blindsided nationalists to any potential good flowing from Brexit. The EU May withdrawal deal came from left field.Nationalists had been feeling abandoned by Downing Street, left to the mercy of a daily London-centric, patronising DUP cacophony coming at them in waves, where Nigel Dodds and his fellow DUP MPS strutted the Westminster stage.In the eyes of nationalists the DUP have wrongly assumed it has authority to speak on behalf of all in Northern Ireland, despite the fact the majority voted to stay in the EU.The May-EU deal has been begrudgingly welcomed by Sinn Féin because it would guard against a hard border. But the reality is that if it holds, a big if, admittedly, then Brexit will do more to redefine Northern Ireland’s status than occurred during 30 years of IRA violence.Sinn Féin will likely hold back from signing up to any Stormont arrangement with the DUP. They know that the sword of Damocles hangs above that party until the cash-for-ash ( Renewable Heat Incentive) scandal inquiry reports in the new year.Sinn Féin is wary about Foster’s ability to deliver a deal. And they would need to be certain that she can deliver in any fresh negotiations. Republicans are mindful too of another shift occurring – there is a sea-change in attitudes of middle-class nationalists.This is not an accident. Doctors, dentists, solicitors, people in business and in many walks of life, from a Catholic nationalist background, ashamed of the IRA’s campaign of violence, much of it visited upon their Protestant neighbours in salubrious residential areas, and in the workplace, kept their heads down during the Troubles and got on with their lives.However, that has changed – to invoke the immortal words of WB Yeats on the back of two words, “crocodile” and “Brexit”. “All changed uttlerly changed.” Middle-class nationalism is no longer sitting on the fence.They like what they know, see and hear in Dublin under the leadership of Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney. They are proud of the Republic as a 21st century State, where its leaders sit comfortably at the Brussels table unencumbered by the historical labels of religious and social conservatism.This fact has not escaped Robinson’s attention either who remarked, while addressing the Methodists in east Belfast, “you can’t speak now of Home Rule being Rome Rule” south of the Border.The hurt – and there is no other word – visited upon nationalism in 2017 by Foster when she said, “if you feed a crocodile it will keep coming back and looking for more” was incalculable.Though the DUP leader was directing her remarks at Sinn Féin’s demand for an Irish Language Act, the injury was felt by all nationalists not just those interested in the language. Reading between the lines, they judged that parity of esteem was not on offer in what Foster calls “my precious union”.That one word did more damage to any nationalist sense of belonging to the patch of land they inhabit than anything ever uttered by former Northern Ireland PM Basil Brookeborough who in 1933 said: “Many in this audience employ Catholics, but I have not one about my place. Catholics are out to destroy Ulster. ”One wonders whether Robinson’s intervention creates a more conducive environment, providing wriggle room for Foster when “parity of esteem” for nationalists next comes back on the table.Unionism believes the sparkle from that sonorous jewel – our precious union – is in danger of losing much of its radiance as a result of the May withdrawal agreement. This is debatable since Northern Ireland’s constitutional position is guaranteed under the terms of the Belfast Agreement.The DUP is clutching desperately at their sense of Britishness. And they genuinely feel the May package poses a threat to their identity politically, constitutionally and culturally. In essence what unionism is desperate to protect is its “parity of esteem” as citizens of the UK.The deficit in the unionist psyche is that it has continuously refused to acknowledge that nationalists also feel they have an entitlement to parity of esteem. This denial to nationalism by unionism is responsible for the absence of a government in Northern Ireland.The DUP’s time in the sun was short lived. Their 10 Westminster MPs proved incapable of keeping a check on their exuberance and sense of self-importance flowing from their agreement with the Conservative party.Soon, allegations of “betrayal” and “vassal state” emerged from the DUP as it warned its deal is with the Conservatives, not with May. It will be interesting to see how long that crutch will bear the political strain.The atmosphere in Westminster fuels the DUP sense of paranoia and its conviction that Northern Ireland is being treated differently from the rest of the UK. It leaves them at risk, too, of ridicule for placing their trust in Conservatives.History students will recall former British prime minister Ted Heath’s proroguing of the Stormont government in the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher’s 1981 secret contacts with IRA hunger strikers, the 1985 signing of the Anglo Irish Agreement over the heads of unionism and former British PM John Major’s secret back channel to Sinn Féin in the early 1990s. The withdrawal agreement is but the latest act in the Conservative-unionist drama.In truth, the DUP is a party that staggers from crisis to crisis and from scandal to scandal.What leader of a large political party wants to have to stand up at its annual conference and wear sackcloth and ashes as Foster did last month in her address over the cash-for-ash scandal.I have observed enough down the years to know that at moments like these where there is talk of any threat to Northern Ireland’s constitutional status this can be accompanied by “rustling in the undergrowth” by loyalists.While the opposition role being played by the DUP to the so called back-stop agreed by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border may serve as a safety valve, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, I suspect will be keeping an ear to the ground.Remarkably the DUP finds itself for the first time at loggerheads with the Ulster Farmers Union (UFU), the Confederation of Business Industry, the NI Retail Consortium, the Chamber of Commerce and several food and drink umbrella groups which are all taking a contrary position on the May withdrawal deal to the DUP. Some of these groups went over the heads of the DUP MPs to meet May in Downing Street.In turn, DUP MP Sammy Wilson accused businesses backing the deal of being “the puppets of the Northern Ireland Office”, while the usually unflappable DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson lost his temper when speaking on The View BBC One Northern Ireland.There, he said, “the UFU and business leaders – they are wrong. I don’t believe they have read the detail of this, they have not read the 500 pages. There are serious constitutional and economic implications of this deal for Northern Ireland.”Such words did not go down well, particularly after Foster indulged in Trumpian politics by claiming that the media is trying to drive a wedge between her party and Northern Ireland’s business community.That opposition to the DUP’s stance has not diminished.For the first time there are signs of fissuring in middle-class unionism. The retired surgeon Terry Irwin who calls himself an Irish unionist tweeted recently: “The DUP have convinced many ‘soft’ unionists like myself to seriously consider whether we would be better in a United Ireland.”Prof Jim Dornan, an obstetrician-gynaecologist, is now entertaining the idea of a new Ireland. He said: “I would traditionally be thought of as being quite happy with the union and I have been. It has been very good to me, educationally and health wise and everything else in my life.”On whether he thought a Border poll would mean a victory for Irish unity, he said: “Against the union as we have at the moment, there is a lot of people nowadays, not just me, who are saying ‘you know what, if somebody offers me a better deal and somebody offers me a good deal, then I would go for it’.” He added, “everything is on the table” after the Brexit vote.I underscored earlier the sea-change in middle-class nationalist opinion. The fluidity of thinking in middle-class unionism – people of business and professional backgrounds cannot be ignored. Around dinner tables some traditional unionists are now openly questioning where they want to be politically – some thinking the unthinkable – living in a new Ireland. The changes may be subtle, but they should not be ignored.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersAny British obstruction of Irish hauliers travelling to and from Europe through the UK could lead to retaliatory restrictions on British traffic in Europe, transport and export industry sources have warned.Concerns about risks to disruptions to the vital route for haulage companies have emerged in light of calls by Conservative former minister Priti Patel to use the “land bridge” as leverage to seek concessions on the Brexit deal.The former international development minister was condemned in Ireland and UK for saying Britain could prevent the use of the country as a bridge between Ireland and European in a no-deal scenario in order to press the Irish Government to drop the contentious backstop.She later backtracked on her comments, saying that they were “taken out of context”.The UK is party to an international agreement on transport through countries known as Common Transit convention, signed in 1987, which guarantees the unhindered transit of goods.The agreement extends beyond European Union member states to countries such as Switzerland, Norway, Turkey, Macedonia and Serbia. Any deliberate delays imposed on goods passing through the UK for products originating from or destined for any of these countries and Ireland would amount to a breach of this convention.“If you stopped vehicles travelling through the land bridge, basically you are tearing up the convention, which would harm British hauliers who rely on that going to the Continent after Brexit,” said Seamus Leheny, policy manager with the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Two-thirds of Irish exporters make use of the UK land bridge, connecting Ireland and Europe through British ports such as Holyhead and Dover, according to the Irish Exporters Association. Some 53 per cent of Irish exports with the rest of the world (excluding the UK) in volume terms pass through the UK.“Would the EU take a dim view of Britain taking unilateral action in relation to the land bridge? Would they retaliate? Maybe they could. It could mean that there is a slowdown of British freight getting on and off the island,” said Simon McKeever, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association.A bigger concern for importers and exporters, and transport companies shipping goods, is the delays arising from customs checks at points of entry into the UK should Theresa May’s Brexit deal be voted down in the House of Commons.Verona Murphy, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, said she did not believe the UK would threaten to block off access for transiting goods but delays could make it seem that way.“If there were to be a no-deal Brexit, the disruption it will cause may well look like the land bridge has been stopped there will be so much traffic backed up at the ports,” she said.Irish business groups are expected to heap significant pressure on Government this week to disclose further details of the no-deal contingency planning being developed privately should the EU-UK orce deal be voted down by the UK parliament, as is widely expected given the level of opposition to the proposed agreement.Government sources fear that any no-deal contingency plans released in Dublin could be used for political advantage by the rival Leave and Remain factions in London to press for further demands from Brussels.The Department of the Taoiseach hosted a meeting of senior civil servants from various Government departments last Friday in what was the latest in a series of planning meetings around no-deal contingency work.Companies in the pharmaceutical and food and drinks industry were planning to begin stockpiling products should Mrs May’s deal be voted down, said Mr McKeever.“We are getting increasingly concerned about a no-deal situation and what happens then,” he said.On Friday, Ireland’s EU commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan, said the Government and State agencies “have to be planning ahead more intensively” for a potential no-deal scenario.He cited the risks to the land bridge specifically and said major energy and other infrastructure projects may need to be brought forward.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They are second-tier elections after all. What happens in the European Parliament also remains a Chinese puzzle to most people. Most have little knowledge and less interest in the day-to-day politics of Brussels. For all that, these elections have traditionally assumed a huge importance for political parties in Ireland. Now, with Brexit looming on the horizon, they also provide an opportunity for parties to restate their European credentials and loyalty to the EU project. More prosaically – and cynically – parties have, in the past, primarily used the elections as profile-building and morale-boosting exercises.The best example is Fine Gael winning five seats in 2004 – on the back of a huge campaign – only two years after the party experienced the worst election in its long history. Labour had a great election in 2009 as did Sinn Féin in 2014 when it won a seat in each of the three constituencies. If a party does well, more often than not it will have a springboard effect in the lead-in to the next general election.The EU parliament elections are still half a year away but most parties have already begun the groundwork. The losers in 2014 (principally Fianna Fáil and Labour) have targeted seats for gains. The winners, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, want to consolidate. One of the few upsides to Brexit is that Ireland has gained an extra two seats, bringing the total from 11 to 13. It means a slight reconfiguration of the three constituencies. Ireland South will now include Laois and Offaly and have five seats. Dublin will have four seats, up one from 2014. And the slight reduction in geographical size for Midlands North West (MNW) will mean it will remain a four-seater.Given the huge area of the South constituency, and the fact Fine Gael’s two MEPs come from Kerry and Cork, the party will need to run a third candidate in the Leinster part. It was Simon Harris in 2014, but the party will have to find somebody new. Similarly in MNW, McGuinness will need a running mate. Former Rose of Tralee Maria Walsh, from Mayo, has been mentioned. A possible transfer for McGuinness into Dublin has also been mooted informally but that is not likely to happen. In Dublin, Senator Catherine Noone’s name is being mentioned. However, the party might do what it has done in the past with McGuinness and Kelly, namely go outside conventional politics to pluck a substantial personality. The SDLP finance spokeswoman Claire Hanna has been approached to move south as Austin Currie and John Cushnahan did in the past. But she is based in Belfast and her political connections in the South would be closer to the Labour Party. Fianna Fáil had a poor election in 2014 and will be hoping to win at least one seat in each constituency. Already in Dublin, three strong candidates, two of them former TDs, have begun canvassing the cumainn and party members. They are former TDs Barry Andrews and Conor Lenihan, and Tiernan Brady, a leading figure in the same-sex marriage referendum in 2015. Another strong name being mention is Andrews’s former colleague in Dún Laoghaire, Mary Hanafin, but she has not indicated any intention as yet. With the constituency enlarged to four seats, the party has a strong chance of winning a seat and Andrews, currently heading up the Institute for International and European Affairs, a pro-EU thinktank, is the slight favourite to get the official party seal at this stage. In MNW, another former TD, Niall Blaney from Donegal, has been busy reaching out to the grass roots and looks a certainty to be the party’s front runner. Others who have been mentioned include Senator Aidan Davitt, and John Comer, a former president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, who is from Mayo . The party won its sole seat in the South in 2014 when Brian Crowley secured 30 per cent of the vote. However, he has not attended any sitting in Brussels and Strasbourg since then because of ill-health. Nor is he a Fianna Fáil representative in Brussels these days after he objected to the party changing its allegiance to the liberal ALDI group. Should Crowley run again, it will be as an independent. So far, a number of possible candidates have been mentioned, including 2014 candidate Fergus Hartley, Wexford councillor Malcolm Byrne, Kerry Senator Ned O’Sullivan, and Jason Fitzgerald, a former member of Renua, who is based in Cork. However, Fianna Fáil is likely to seek a high-profile candidate in the Cork area. Another name mentioned Cllr Séamus McGrath, a brother of its finance spokesman Michael McGrath. Like Fine Gael, Sinn Féin will be hoping to hold on to its current level of seats. Lynn Boylan in Dublin and Liadh Ní Riada in South are likely to stand again. The party will have to find a replacement in MNW where Matt Carty will contest the Dáil elections. The European elections have always been happy hunting grounds for smaller parties and Independents. Of the three Independents, only Luke “Ming” Flanagan in MNW is certainly staying on. Nessa Childers in Dublin is retiring and Marian Harkin in MNW has yet to make a definite decision about her future. A number of former TDs have expressed interest in Labour nominations including Alex White in Dublin, Dominic Hannigan from Louth in MNW and Michael McNamara from Clare in South. The former head of Amnesty International EU’s office, Iverna McGowan, has also expressed interest. And then there are the Greens. The party has had MEPs before and Eamon Ryan came close in 2014. The party will have a real chance in both the expanded Dublin and South with high-profile Ciarán Cuffe and Senator Grace O’Sullivan as their candidates.

Photograph: Karen MinasyanAFPGetty Images Armenia’s acting prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, bolstered his authority as his political bloc won early parliamentary elections in the former Soviet country on Sunday, the Central Election Commission’s (CEC) results showed.My Step Alliance, which includes Pashinyan’s Civil Contract Party, won 70.4 per cent of the vote based on results from all polling stations, the CEC said on its website.Results showed that two moderate opposition parties - Prosperous Armenia and Bright Armenia - got enough votes to clear the 5 per cent threshold to enter parliament.Mr Pashinyan came to power in Armenia in May after weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism. The former newspaper editor, who was jailed for fomenting unrest in 2008, marked a dramatic break from the cadre of rulers who have run Armenia since the late 1990s.He stepped down in October so parliament could be dissolved ready for the early election but remained the acting prime minister.“Armenian citizens created a revolutionary majority at the parliament,” Mr Pashinyan told reporters at his bloc’s headquarters after first results were published.“If this trend continues, the majority won’t face any problems in implementing legislative changes,” he said.After a change of power in the South Caucasus country of around 3 million people, Mr Pashinyan’s government sought to initiate changes to the electoral code. But the move was blocked by the former ruling Republican Party, which dominated the parliament.The Republican Party received 4.70 per cent of the vote and it was not clear whether it managed to enter parliament. Under Armenia’s constitution, 30 per cent of seats in parliament must go to opposition parties.Former high-ranking officials were sacked and some were arrested following the change of power. An appeals court ordered the detention of former president Robert Kocharyan on Friday on charges of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order.He was first arrested in July but freed the following month, and the case was sent to the appeals court. Mr Kocharyan was Armenia’s second president, serving from 1998 to 2008, when mass protests erupted over a disputed election.Mr Pashinyan promised after taking office there would be no major shifts in Armenian foreign policy and has offered assurances he will not break with Moscow.Armenia hosts a Russian military base and is a member of Russia-led military and economic alliances.Mr Pashinyan also suggested he would stick with existing policies on the long-running issue of Nagorno-Karabakh.A mountainous part of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh is run by ethnic Armenians who declared independence from Baku during a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991.Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia still regularly accuse each other of conducting attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Azeri-Armenian border.–PA "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3725492.1544387782!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pressure builds on may to delay brexit deal vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK Independence Party  and pro-Brexit supporters at the “Brexit Betrayal” march in London on Sunday. Photograph: Andy RainEPATheresa May is under growing pressure to postpone Tuesday’s vote on her Brexit deal and to attempt to persuade the European Union to renegotiate it. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said on Sunday that the vote would go ahead as planned, despite the fact that dozens of Conservative MPs have said they will vote against the prime minister’s deal. “The vote is going ahead and that’s because it’s a good deal and it’s the only deal,” Mr Barclay told the BBC. Some Conservatives fear that pressing ahead with the vote will lead to a crushing defeat for Mrs May which could doom her Brexit deal and her premiership. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the prime minister should insist that Britain be able to unilaterally end the Northern Ireland backstop. “Is it possible for us to reword this Northern Ireland Protocol, the 174-pages, so as it give the UK a unilateral exit mechanism? Yes, it is. And indeed the UK drafted such proposals but then failed to table them. That is the way to go,” he said. Mr Johnson refused to promise that he would not seek to replace Mrs May as prime minister, joining two other former ministers, Esther McVey and Dominic Raab, who declined to rule out a bid for the Conservative leadership. Mr Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary last month, claimed that the European Commission’s secretary general Martin Selmayr wanted to make Northern Ireland the price for Britain leaving the EU. “You would hear swirling around in Brussels, particularly people around Selmayr . . . that losing Northern Ireland would be the price the UK would pay for Brexit. This was reported to me through the diplomatic channels,” he told Sky News. Mr Raab said that leaving the EU without a deal was better than accepting Mrs May’s Brexit deal but he said she could stay on as prime minister even if she loses Tuesday’s vote. He said she could return to Brussels and tell the other 27 EU member states she wanted to renegotiate the deal. “If parliament has voted the deal down I think she can go and say this deal doesn’t work for the United Kingdom, ” he said. Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, who wants a second referendum on Brexit, warned on Sunday his party could split over the issue and find itself unable to continue in its current form. “I can see that this is of such a fundamental character, this issue, that it may be the end of the Conservative Party in its current form, and that bothers me very much because one of the products of Brexit has been total paralysis on virtually every other area of policy,” he said. In central London on Sunday, anti-fascist demonstrators massively outnumbered those at a “Brexit betrayal” march led by Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right figure who styles himself Tommy Robinson. Elsewhere in London, the former Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine told supporters of a second referendum that opposing Brexit was an act of patriotism: “Let us make our position clear. We are the British patriots. We want a Britain at the heart of Europe because we want the voice of Britain, the tolerance of Britain, the culture of Britain, at the heart of Europe. We are proud of our Commonwealth and empire. Our voice is their voice in Europe. It is the Brexiteers who seek to belittle us, to undermine our influence, to slam windows, to close doors with the suggestion that our membership of the European community blunts our influence.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

In this case, her partner had a natural excuse to explain her absence and for that reason I think, for now, he\u0027s got away with it.Stable isotope analysis, which was not available back in 2004, was used to find out where the woman was living before her death. Scientists studied the levels of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen in samples of her hair, teeth and bones.This provides information about drinking water and soil which could shed light on a person\u0027s previous location.Tests on her bones and teeth confirmed she grew up in south east Asia and a hair sample had isotopes on it found in just a few places in Britain, including south Cumbria and northern Lancashire.The woman was found off a rocky track which can only be reached using a 4x4, leading investigators to believe the killer lived in a rural location.It is also thought the murderer had good knowledge of the area because the body was not dumped in the Sell Gill Holes caves where walkers often visit, but was instead positioned out of sight under a hump in the grass.The woman was likely aged between 25 and 35, weighed about 10 stone and was 4ft 11ins tall, with shoulder-length dark brown hair. In 2007 a coroner recorded an open verdict and she was buried in Horton in Ribblesdale after the parish council stepped in to organise her funeral when no one came forward to identify her.Pathologists concluded she had been dead for between one and three weeks and had been in the open air for just a few days.They found no obvious injuries which might explain her death and her organs were so decomposed that they could not determine if she died of natural causes.North Yorkshire Police told The  they do not have any new information about the case.What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?Brexit latest news: UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 and halt departure from EUNikol Pashinyan wins Armenia election by landslide in \u0026#39revolutionary\u0026#39 voteWhat is the Brexit backstop, and how might it bring down the British Government?Grace Millane: Man accused over backpacker murder appears in court as PM apologises on behalf of New Zealand for her deathWhat time does Parliament vote on the Brexit deal tomorrow?

Quick Reaction Alert jets based at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland are regularly  scrambled to deter Russian aircraft approaching UK airspace over the North Sea.The exact nature of last week\u0027s incident remained classified.The introduction of Meteor represents the culmination of many years of research, development and testing to bring the advanced weapon into service on front-line aircraft.The Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: “This latest missile system demonstrates the next chapter of the Typhoon which will see the jet evolve its ability to target and destroy any airborne threat at great distances.“The Meteor missile will provide an unrelenting deterrence to those who wish harm upon the UK and our Armed Forces.“The RAF’s prized Typhoon Force is unquestionably now the cornerstone of British and Nato military power. It has proved itself in combat roles over Libya, Iraq and Syria, protecting UK skies and overseas territories, and providing critical support to our NATO Allies in Eastern Europe.”Meteor can fly in any weather condition at over four times the speed of sound. It has been designed to defeat all current and known future threats, including combat aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles or missiles. The range of the weapon is classified, but it will eventually operate from the F-35 Lightning stealth jet.The missile - weighing 185kgs and measuring 3.7m long - uses an air-breathing ramjet to boost the weapon away from the launch aircraft. It then remains under power until warhead detonation, giving the missile the energy to pursue and destroy the fastest and most agile aircraft.The warhead carries impact and proximity fuses so targets can be destroyed even if the missile does not score a direct hit.The pilot flying the first Meteor equipped Typhoon said: “The responsibility of flying such a capable platform, armed with this formidable weapon is immense, but the options this gives us in responding to an emergency situation cannot be understated.”Meteor has been developed by a six-nation European partnership led by the UK. It is built and manufactured by MBDA in Stevenage and has created 430 jobs across the country. The Meteor programme partners include the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 and halt departure from EUNikol Pashinyan wins Armenia election by landslide in \u0026#39revolutionary\u0026#39 voteWhat is the Brexit backstop, and how might it bring down the British Government?Grace Millane: Man accused over backpacker murder appears in court as PM apologises on behalf of New Zealand for her deathWhat time does Parliament vote on the Brexit deal tomorrow?

Averse to exercise. You see him on the Vitality posters on the Underground. It’s a clever advertising ploy because the point is to get you to do more exercise. And the surprising thing – if you look more closely – is it’s all about insurance.It used to be you bought life or health insurance, stuck the paperwork in a drawer, and then forgot about it, until you got ill or they called for the priest. That has all changed – as Herschel Mayers, CEO of Vitality, explained to me. Born in Zimbabwe, he was brought up in Johannesburg, and ides his time between South Africa and London. After a few years with Liberty, Mayers co-founded Discovery Life, now the largest insurer in South Africa. He joined forces with Prudential in 2014 to set up Vitality. Now 58, he trained as an actuary, so he’s good at mathematics and statistics and probabilities and improbabilities. But stick with me here, because he is also good at making it simple. Personal confession: many moons ago I turned down the opportunity to go about selling insurance because I thought of it as too doom-laden and didn’t want to scare the pants off people (“You know you’re going to die, don’t you? Stop kidding yourself, you’d better be prepared!”).The genius of Herschel Mayers lies in changing the narrative. He has spun insurance around 180 degrees and turned it away from being about dying or getting ill and made it all about keeping fit and well and living longer. He made me feel healthier just talking to him. A View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonHouzz CEO Adi Tatarko on running a $4bn internet startup A View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techVitality has a so-called “wellness philosophy”, but this isn’t as hazy and airy-fairy as it sounds. You know all those good intentions you blithely announce around New Year and then it all goes to pot until the next round of solemn promises? Mr Mayers doesn’t want you to revert to couch potato. “Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you and exercise is good,” says Mayers. The interesting question he asks is, “How do you get people to change their behaviour for the better?” His answer is more carrot than stick – or, as it is now known, “behavioural economics”. This is how it works: you sign up to Vitality. Vitality straight off the bat gives you a 20 per cent discount, providing you agree to go to the gym regularly. And they give you juicy little incentives along the way if you stick by your commitment – free cinema tickets, coffee at Starbucks, an Amazon Prime subscription. The benevolent Mr Mayers is, in effect, paying you to keep hitting the cross-trainer or doing your 10,000 steps every day. The more steps, the less smoking, the better the incentive. Conversely, your discount is “eroded” over time if you slack and go back to your bad old ways. Can’t I just phone in or email to say how good I’ve been? Mayers has anticipated my would-be cunning deception. “That’s why we give you an ‘activity tracker’. We monitor your good behaviour.” So you actually have to clock in at the gym. They know if your heartbeat goes up or not. “It has to be verifiable,” says Mayers. So don’t think you can just sneak outside and have a quick fag. Such is the joy of social media. “We have daily interaction.”But, I can’t help wondering, isn’t that a bit tyrannical? \u0026nbsp“It would be, if we were forcing you,” says Mayers, reasonably enough. “But we’re not forcing you, it’s your choice to buy into the system in the first place. You don’t have to do it. But it makes more sense.” The logic of the deal is the “shared value model”, developed originally by Professor Michael E Porter at Harvard, a theory Mayers has translated into practice. The Vitality customer or “member” is given a subtle (or not so subtle) “nudge” in the direction of staying in better nick for longer. The value, or benefit, is shared by both the insured – who gets to enjoy life more, both quantitatively and qualitatively – and the insurer, who pays out less on claims. Everyone is a winner, including the nation as a whole, which gets one more useful and productive citizen to add to the GDP, and the NHS, which has one less chronically ill patient to look after for years on end. “By changing behaviour,” says Mayers, “we want to create additional economic value.” Call me a nanny-state guy if you will, but, realistically, when you’re up against the proliferation of cardiac-inducing fast food and fried chicken outlets, you need to do something to try and level the playing field. It’s not exactly King Canute trying to hold back the tide, it’s more Canute, or in this case Vitality, providing everyone (or at least the million or so members of the club) with surfboards to skim across the waves rather than just sit there on your backside getting swamped. “We are making a difference,” says Mayers. “People do go for check-ups and our claims are lower.” The Harvard-inspired theory is working so well that Mayers has now extended it into the realm of investing or saving. You know that other good intention you have, to put a bit aside from your wages for your retirement? And you know how it would be better to start sooner rather than later, ideally in your twenties? “Everyone knows this, but they don’t do it,” says Mayers. Well, guess who is going to give you a gentle nudge in that general direction? Vitality’s persuader in this case is a 20 per cent bonus at the end of it, when you collect your pension payout – providing you’ve behaved well and haven’t started too late or withdrawn it all too soon. Makes sense to me, so much so I suggested it to my two twenty-something sons. They scoffed (as is their wont). “But they are offering all these incentives,” I said. “Maybe they could consider paying off our student debt then,” they said.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It has also accredited\u0026nbspmore than 4,700 living wage employers but many large listed companies are not yet among them.Mara Lilley, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, said pressure from shareholders about low pay has already had an impact.When the group started engaging with FTSE 100 companies in 2010, only two were accredited by the Living Wage Foundation. That number now stands at 37.\u0026nbsp“Companies are clearly listening to their shareholders,” Ms Lilley said.“By engaging with companies on behalf of savers, these investors are showing that it’s entirely possible to focus on good returns as well as the interests of employees who may be struggling despite being in work.”\u0026nbspDiandra Soobiah, head of responsible investment at NEST, said there were “clear benefits” to companies paying the living wage, such as improved reputation, which can in turn boost profits.More than 6 million UK jobs ‘pay less than real living wage’Minimum wage failing to give families a basic \u0027no frills\u0027 lifestyle100,000 more women than men in Scotland paid less than the living wage“As a pension scheme with more than 7 million savers we need to achieve the best possible investment returns on their behalf.\u0026nbsp“That’s why we’re calling on the companies we invest in to do the right thing and sign up to the real Living Wage.”\u0026nbspMedian annual earnings are still £760 lower than they were a decade ago, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).People in their 20s and 30s have been hit hardest, with drops of 4.6 per cent and 7.6 per cent on the same age groups in 2008.While the UK’s official unemployment rate is at its lowest in more than four decades, many of the jobs created since the financial crisis have been low-paid and insecure.According to the Joseph Rowntree foundation, one of the key drivers of rising\u0026nbsppoverty\u0026nbsplevels has been parents getting stuck in low-paid work, particularly in hospitality and retail,Jackie Turpin, head of finance at Jospeph Rowntree Charitable Trust\u0026nbspsaid: “We firmly believe that a workforce that feels valued and respected will outperform one that doesn’t.\u0026nbsp“We welcome collaborative engagement to demonstrate that this belief is widely held and is rooted in many people’s experience.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe stalemate led the oil price to fall - the commodity had previously dropped by 30 per cent from four-year highs of more than $86 per barrel in October to below $59 at the end of November. However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

Whether it helps the right young people, I’m not convinced,” she told The Observer.“There’s also evidence that if you remove tuition fees altogether, there would be a certain number of young people from particular backgrounds who wouldn’t be able to go to university at all – but if you restore something like the education maintenance allowance or a version of it, I think you would widen participation.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

Instagram doesn\u0027t offer the feature, however.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThankfully, you don\u0027t have to pick through all your pictures and find out the best ones: there\u0027s plenty of websites available to do that for you.

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily.

The site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.Instagram finally lets people choose who sees storiesThe feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you\u0027re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn\u0027t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you\u0027ve locked it down you won\u0027t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram\u0027s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren\u0027t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It has also accredited\u0026nbspmore than 4,700 living wage employers but many large listed companies are not yet among them.Mara Lilley, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, said pressure from shareholders about low pay has already had an impact.When the group started engaging with FTSE 100 companies in 2010, only two were accredited by the Living Wage Foundation. That number now stands at 37.\u0026nbsp“Companies are clearly listening to their shareholders,” Ms Lilley said.“By engaging with companies on behalf of savers, these investors are showing that it’s entirely possible to focus on good returns as well as the interests of employees who may be struggling despite being in work.”\u0026nbspDiandra Soobiah, head of responsible investment at NEST, said there were “clear benefits” to companies paying the living wage, such as improved reputation, which can in turn boost profits.More than 6 million UK jobs ‘pay less than real living wage’Minimum wage failing to give families a basic \u0027no frills\u0027 lifestyle100,000 more women than men in Scotland paid less than the living wage“As a pension scheme with more than 7 million savers we need to achieve the best possible investment returns on their behalf.\u0026nbsp“That’s why we’re calling on the companies we invest in to do the right thing and sign up to the real Living Wage.”\u0026nbspMedian annual earnings are still £760 lower than they were a decade ago, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).People in their 20s and 30s have been hit hardest, with drops of 4.6 per cent and 7.6 per cent on the same age groups in 2008.While the UK’s official unemployment rate is at its lowest in more than four decades, many of the jobs created since the financial crisis have been low-paid and insecure.According to the Joseph Rowntree foundation, one of the key drivers of rising\u0026nbsppoverty\u0026nbsplevels has been parents getting stuck in low-paid work, particularly in hospitality and retail,Jackie Turpin, head of finance at Jospeph Rowntree Charitable Trust\u0026nbspsaid: “We firmly believe that a workforce that feels valued and respected will outperform one that doesn’t.\u0026nbsp“We welcome collaborative engagement to demonstrate that this belief is widely held and is rooted in many people’s experience.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Alongside the tweet, Cannon wrote\u0026nbsp“And I f**king love Wreck-It Ralph,” a reference to Silverman\u0027s role as the\u0026nbspvoice of Vanellope in the animation.Finally, Cannon resurfaced a 2012 tweet from Amy Schumer reading, “Enjoy skyfall f***. I\u0027m bout to get knee deep in Helen Hunt #thesessions.” He added the message: I’m just saying... should we keep going?Hart stepped down from hosting the Oscars after refusing to apologise for resurfaced jokes in which he uses homophobic slurs.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. 140 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom?

PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks.

It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable.

We work hard to ensure that our customers can limit the impact and restore their services as soon as possible.”Ericsson says O2 data will be coming back ‘as soon as possible’The company said most of its affected customers had got back online, but that some – presumably including Tesco – were still not working, and that it was continuing to work with them.On Thursday evening, O2’s\u0026nbspchief executive said\u0026nbsphe was “sorry because we have let our customers down”.\u0026nbspMark Evans told Sky News restoration of the network had started and it would be completed by Friday morning.\u0026nbspPressed\u0026nbspby Sky News host\u0026nbspDermot Murnaghan\u0026nbspif the company would compensate customers, Mr Evans would only say it would “find a way of making an apology in an O2 way”.\u0026nbspMr Evans admitted, however,\u0026nbsphe did “not know yet” what “an O2 way” meant.The problems with the service provide\u0026nbsphave hit as many as 30 million people in the UK, affecting not only O2 customers but users of the networks that borrow their infrastructure, such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff.It also hit transport networks and other systems that rely on O2’s\u0026nbspinternet connections to transfer data.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They will be informed about when that is available.O2 data network restored after millions hit by day-long outageAnd pay as you go customers on O2\u0027s mobile broadband will also be given a 10 per cent discount on a Bolt On purchase in the new year.All of O2\u0027s\u0026nbsp30 million customers are thought to have been hit by the outage, and so will be receiving the free package.Customers do not appear to need to do anything to get the refund, and will either be contacted to alert them to it or will just receive the additional airtime added to their bill.It is not clear whether customers of the networks that were also offline because they rely on O2\u0027s infrastructure – such as GiffGaff\u0026nbspand Tesco\u0026nbspMobile – will also be getting refunds from their carriers.The outage caused problems across the UK, including in some unusual places, such as live bus arrivals at bus stops, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata connection.It lasted for almost a full day, going down early in the morning and with service only being restored overnight the following evening.O2 said the issues were caused by problems with software provided by Ericsson. It also caused problems elsewhere in the world, such as at Japan\u0027s Softbank.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia.

However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But at the moment I’m looking at who is in the papers, who can we get behind, but it shouldn’t be about the personality it should be about the country.”\u0026nbspMs McVey\u0026nbspsaid she would support the prime minister if she were to go back to Brussels and try and renegotiate the deal, in particular around the Irish backstop and the £39bn ‘orce bill’ that Ms May’s withdrawal agreement accounts for.Mr Raab was interviewed on the same show, and asked if he would rule out a run, he said: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out, but I’m just not going to get sucked in to that debate.“The public and people watching this show would think it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in that speculation.”He would not comment when asked if he would stand aside for fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson to run for the leadership.It\u0026nbspcame as comments the government was hit by another resignation over the Brexit plan –\u0026nbspWill Quince, a ministerial aide to defence secretary Gavin Williamson.He hit out at the backstop plan to avoid a hard border with Ireland, saying it could result in the UK being “tied to the negotiating table for years, until we agree to anything in desperation” to get out of the situation.For her part, Ms May warned Tory MPs they risk handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10 unless they back her Brexit deal in an interview with Mail on Sunday, .“It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal,” she told the Mail on Sunday.“We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country.“As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.”Reports suggested Ms May could make an emergency trip to Brussels ahead of a planned summit on Thursday in an effort to secure further concessions in an effort to win over critics of her plan.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Both need (or needed in the recent past) the complete removal of the original tropical forest.”Based on forest loss trends, if governments do not act immediately and end acceptance of certification schemes, the world will almost completely lose southeast Asian forests in a few decades, he warned.\u0026nbsp“Our research shows quite unequivocally that, unfortunately, there is no way to produce sustainable palm oil that did not come from deforestation, and that the claims by corporations, certification schemes and non government organisations are simply ‘greenwashing’, useful to continue business as usual,” he\u0026nbspadded. “No shortcuts: if you use palm oil, certified or not, you are definitely destroying tropical forests.”Claims by corporations, certification schemes and\u0026nbspNGOs\u0026nbspare simply ‘greenwashing’, useful to continue business as usualForest loss was continuous everywhere where there was a palm oil plantation, even if certified as sustainable.“Every tropical tree, which is part of a complex tropical forest, harbours thousands of other species – insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, birds, monkeys, primates such as orangutans, ferns, mosses – and every time a tropical tree is cut to make room for a plantation a whole community, often including very rare species, may disappear.\u0026nbspHe accused those who say certified plantations are sustainable of hiding the evidence.According to the study, which was published in the\u0026nbspScience of the Total Environment\u0026nbspjournal,\u0026nbspthere is a trick to “certification”: first, an old-growth tropical forest is cut (or slashed-and-burned) for paper and pulp or valuable tropical timber trades then a traditional, non-certified palm oil plantation is started after a certain time the traditional plantation is “transformed” into a certified one and wins a sustainability label.We do not have any means to stop southeast Asian deforestation due to palm oil with labels and certification schemes“The trick is that they make leverage on the absence of historical records on land use change, hiding the reality that even a certified concession was, in the recent past, a highly bioerse tropical forest,” Prof Gatti said.His team said they also found a pattern in which deforestation slows when organisations such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil form, but a few years later, the forest loss speeds back up. “This can be also due to the more recent establishment of new ‘sustainable plantations’ and the need to cut new forests to fuel the increasing global market,” according to the researchers.The report says areas in which forest loss was detected and those of both traditional and certified plantations almost exactly overlap, so any land that is certified today was a “valuable and bioerse” forest in the recent past.Created with Sketch.10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate change Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

If this is true, my question is why palm oil has to be considered an essential livelihood for humanity.“The problem escalated in the last 15 years and there is no need for a globalised production of this cheap oil in unnecessary products. If the conservation of tropical forest is a priority of our society, then there is no way to produce palm oil for the world market as we show in our research.\u0026nbspTropical forests have an inner value, independently of the economy of their production.”He urged a combination of a more localised use of oils, cutting fatty and unhealthy snack foods such as those containing palm oil, bans on importing palm oil by the EU, US, China and India and the use of more sustainable oils.\u0026nbspThe professor said he believed that claims that the industry provides swathes of jobs were weak because the multinationals’ contracts with mills in southeast Asia were temporary, short-term ones.“Quite often whole families (including children) work in the plantations, without any respect of human and children’s rights, in very unhealthy conditions (covered by sprayed pesticides, for instance).”The Independent has asked the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004542255871.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"why is the pm ploughing on","story":"She cannot sell the unsellable.

But not a mechanism we cannot legally leave, potentially locking us ­forever into a customs union and iding upthe UK. Even an EU blinded by self-interest must see that.Downing Street’s defeatism is soul destroying. Chancellor Philip Hammond, with his famous no-can-do spirit, says: “The idea there’s an option of renegotiating at the thhour is a delusion.”Why  If the EU dislikes the backstop too, as the Government claims, it should be amenable to amending it.

Senior figures there say that will not be decided until Monday.But they do admit they are making little headway in trying to quell this rebellion, and that they are heading for a loss.How big  “I’m sure it’ll breach three figures”, one Cabinet minister says of the margin of defeat.A way to avoid such a humiliation would be to find an amendment that could pass the Commons.This means there would be no vote on May’s deal as it currently stands, enabling the Government to argue that it hadn’t actually been defeated.Though, as one source admits, voters would be left baffled by this procedural trick.This approach isn’t guaranteed to work either.First of all, it would rely on John Bercow selecting the amendment — which is far from certain. The Speaker is supposed to be impartial, but Bercow has long used his power to cause the Government trouble.Much of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting was taken up with ministers complaining about him. Liam Fox, the Trade ­Secretary, called Bercow “a disgrace to his office”.Also, some Tory rebels are itching to defeat the Government. They are discussing whether to vote against ALL amendments, regardless of whether they agree with them or not, so they can make clear their opposition to May’s deal. Some in Cabinet think thatMPs voted for an amendment setting out what would make the deal acceptable to Parliament, it would strengthen May’s hand with the EU.One tells me: “The negotiation has been all about us saying yes or no. This would make the EU say yes or no to something.”Chancellor Philip Hammond, though, argued at Thursday’s inner Cabinet that any concessions are more likely to come after a vote has been lost — so there was a case for pressing on.What May thinks the way ahead is remains unclear even to her inner Cabinet, much to their frustration.“The main problem is that it is very dficult to read the PM,” one tells me, adding that, “Until she decides what she wants to do, it is very dficult to put weight behind any ­particular outcome.”Backbench Tory MPs are also becoming increasingly irritated with her.One senior figure who is ­normally sympathetic complains that she has become “completely messianic about the backstop”. This source says that Tory MPs “want to hear a solution rather than this is the only choice and they’re stupid”.Allies of May are deeply pessimistic about the EU offering any meaningful concessions.Their view is that the EU thinks that the alternatives to May’s deal are either a softer Brexit or a second referendum, so it has little incentive to offer much up.Not everyone in the Cabinet is so sure.One senior minister, with Prime Ministerial ambitions, has been explaining to junior ministers in detail how they could negotiate a better deal on the backstop.Tory leadership contenders are readying themselves.They calculate thatthe vote goes ahead this week May will lose by a big margin, the  letters will then go in and May could well lose that vote of confidence, triggering a contest.If she does go ahead with Tuesday’s vote, she’ll be betting her premiership on keeping the margin of defeat respectable. It would be a mighty gamble.There are two reasons for this. First, the Labour front bench are not keen on Norway-Plus and a number of those on the Labour benches who did support it have moved to backing a second ­referendum. Second, there is now more Tory opposition to it than there was before, particularly among the Cabinet.One Secretary of State warns that a Norway Plus deal “would destroy the Conservative Party forever”.The problem is that in an effort to make the plan acceptable to the Europeans, it has gone from being a temporary solution that would give the UK time to negotiate a free trade deal with the  EU to an indefinite arrangement that involves accepting the withdrawal agreement and with  it the ­backstop. This all makes it much less ­acceptable to Brexiteers.Even those in the Cabinet who are sympathetic to the idea admit that it would face problems.One tells me: “I am not sure it is possible because so many people would trash it.”Norway-Plus would also require a new leader.Those close to May say she could not endorse a deal that did not end free movement.EVENthe Government loses heavily on Tuesday, it would still survive a vote of confidence.The Tory rebels and the DUP have been clear that they would vote for the Government in that debate.This poses a dilemma for Labour.It means that any attempt to bring down the Government would fail, and risk providing a rare moment of Tory unity. I understand, though, that opposition parties have been mulling a dferent approach – a censure motion in the PM.This would allow the House to express its disapproval of May’s handling of Brexit, without bringing down the Government.The thinking is that this might persuade the DUP to support it.  It would demonstrate that without them, the Government cannot win a confidence vote.Traditionally, these censure motions have been accompanied by a cut in salary for the minister concerned. But there are worries on the Opposition benches that such an approach could backfire because it would look too personal.So,the UK couldn’t now leave without a deal without facing catastrophic consequences, who should carry the can for that ONE theory doing the rounds this week is that May could resign as PM and advise the Queen to ask her de facto deputy, David Lidington, to form a government.This government would then, so the thinking goes, move towards a Norway-style deal.But I am told there would be resignations from the Cabinetthis happened, and a leading Tory backbencher warns that such a government would not be able to command the confidence of the House.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is not the serious, sensible, unying compromise he believes. Nor does it deliver on the referendum.Joining EFTA — part of the European Economic Area — alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein would leave us nominally “out” of the EU. But that’s pretty much where it ends.We would still be in the single market, accepting free movement, with a supposed “brake” we would never deploy.Worse, we would remain in an EU customs union too, to “avoid” the mythical hard border in Ireland no one will ever build.We would effectively still be EU members  with no vote, nor power to strike our own trade deals — wrecking Brexit’s central economic case.It’s a non-Brexit that only satisfies Remainers. The Leave victory was motivated by a desire for sovereignty, including  control over immigration. This fulfils none of it. It won’t fly.Even a second referendum is better  — though obviously “Remain” cannot be on the ballot, the first vote having ruled it out.CAN the Government not see the obvious conclusion voters draw from its zombie-apocalypse vision of a no-deal Brexit Downing Street trots out these scenarios — medicines, food and water running short and bodies going unburied — like they were inevitable.

The French would come for our fish and our banks. The Germans would want concessions on EU immigration.Other countries would want more money.It would be a nightmare negotiation. So why do my friends think they must vote for it Because they believe that there is no alternative: that we may not like what has happened – but that we have run out of time and run out of road.It is crucial to understand that this pessimism is just flat wrong.If this deal is voted down on Tuesday – and I devoutly hope it is - we need to do two big things.First we need to change the Withdrawal Agreement, keeping all the sensible things that have been agreed on citizens’ rights, but getting rid of the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.We should use the so-called transition period both to negotiate a big and generous zero tarf zero quota free trade deal, and to solve the technical problems posed by the Northern Ireland border.There is no reason why we should not use that time – almost two years – to put in place the systems that will allow our whole country to come out of both the customs union and the single market, which is what the people were promised both at the referendum and the general election.We should be clear that we will keep back at least half of the £billion until the free trade deal is done.And second it is time now to show our EU friends that we mean business.This should be a take it or leave it offer – and so show that we mean business we must be able to walk away.This is a great country, capable of rising to immense challenges – and I believe the people of this country are fed up to the back teeth of being told by their government that they are simply incapable of managing the logistical problems of Brexit, when for two and a half years this government has studiously and deliberately failed to address those logistical problems.It is that failure and that lack of resolve that has so weakened our hand in the talks.Now is the time to get on with it – and remember,we have to go down this route, we will have the entire £billion to spend on it.We need to get our ports ready, hire the staff, ensure that the planes can fly and that companies are helped to transfer their data under any circumstances.I don’t believe for a moment that our EU friends and partners want such an outcome.They have a £ billion surplus with us in goods alone.They don’t want barriers to trade.They want a deal as much as we do.Do you really think that the people of the Calais region would be gratefulthe Paris government took steps to block commercial traffic from the UK Have you seen what is going on in France No one wants disruption of any kind – and the way to avoid it is to get ready to manage it now, with energy and conviction.We can still get a great deal, and I am sure we will.

Instead of honouring and respecting the referendum, politicians would be ignoring the result.Pulling out of the EU is a hugely complex task. Leaving a bloc that we joined nearly  years ago, while staying friends with its members, means that everyone has to compromise.Some people legitimately say that the Withdrawal Agreement is not perfect, but it offers the most practical way of doing what the British electorate want.People voted to take back control of our borders, laws and money. This deal fulfils those instructions, while protecting jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.If you are in the EU, you have to accept the automatic right of any citizen of any other member state to live and work in your country.This agreement will end that situation and restore the British Government’s power to decide who should settle in our country. We will admit people with the right skills for our economy, regardless of their background.Britain is generous and tolerant, so the rights of EU citizens already living here will be protected, along with the rights of Britons residing in the EU.We will also stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing the British Government to decide on public spending priorities.As I know from my previous job, this Government’s priority is the NHS.

We will discuss how to take forward our work to counter the common threats from terrorists and hostile states. That vital task will continue under the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal, which allows us to work together when it makes sense, and go our own way when we want.The real choice is not between the Prime Minister’s agreement and a perfect solution.The real choice is between this agreement and going back to square one and running the risk of Brexit not happening at all.

What does that tell you ”He added: “I don’t see what the point is in going down to a huge defeat.”Mr Blair blasted Mrs May for trying to sell a deal that was “half-in, half-out”, declaring: “Do Brexit or don’t”.And mocking his famous motto, he said “this time there is no acceptable third way”.But on Sunday, newly-installed Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay told the Andrew Marr show: The vote is going ahead and thats because its a good deal and its the only deal.And he says that Theresa May could remain PM evenher deal was heavily defeated by MPs.Just a day before the vote, the European Court of Justice ruled the UK could cancel Brexit without getting permission from other EU members.Theresa May has rejected pleas from jittery senior Tories for a delay in the crunch Commons vote on her Brexit deal.A string of ministers and backbenchers pressed the Prime Minister to postpone the so-called meaningful vote in Parliament scheduled for December , , on the agreement with Brussels in the face of a mass rebellion.But May and her allies insisted the ision will go ahead next week and vowed to continue their attempt to win over dozens of rebel Tory MPs.A Downing Street spokeswoman said: The vote is happening on Tuesday.Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee of Tory backbenchers, publicly urged the Prime Minister to put off the vote until the party row over the so-called Northern Ireland backstop could be resolved.I think the most important thing is to have clarity about how we might remove ourselves from a backstopwe were to enter into one in the future, Sir Graham said.Its having the answer to that question of substance that is most important, not the timing, sothat question can be answered in the course of the next few days then all well and good.If it cant then I certainly would welcome the vote being deferred until such time as we can answer that question.Amid growing speculation about the looming vote, several Cabinet ministers met the Prime Minister in Downing Street to discuss the crisis over the parliamentary vote.Philip Hammond, Michael Gove, Amber Rudd, Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox were among ministers seen going into Number .Other sources said pro-Brussels ministers including Mr Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Business Secretary Greg Clark told Mrs May they could not support the country quitting the EU without a deal.After the meeting, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: The Prime Minister has been meeting her colleagues.

The amendment will give legal weight to this commitment”.Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay insisted on Sunday that the vote was “going ahead” on Tuesday as planned as the PM secured “the only deal” available.He wouldn’t rule out the PM going back to the EU to try to reopen the negotiation on the deal this week.But Mr Barclay warned the move could badly backfire, saying: “The risk for those who simply say go back go back and ask again, well that isn’t necessarily a one-way street.“The French, the Spanish and others will turn roundwe seek to reopen the negotiation and ask for more.”Senior Tory Brexiteers also warned No faces “an almighty row” in Parliamentit does try to pull the vote on the deal.Labour and other opposition MPs will try to force the PM into holding it anyway to humiliate her.As all options looked daunting for Mrs May, former No adviser Tom Swarbrick dubbed her survival as “extremely unlikely in any circumstances”.No still fears Cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt may be one of a number of ministers to resign ahead of the voteit goes ahead.Aides of the Development Secretary were still on Sunday night refusing to say whether she would vote for the deal at the th hour.Tory grandees again predicted that the battle over Brexit could tear the party apart for good.Ex-Attorney General Dominic Grieve said it “cannot continue in its current form”, telling Sky News’s Ridge on Sunday: “There is a risk the party will split”.Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng admitted that “one of two people might leave”.In a Sunday newspaper interview, Mrs May warned Conservative MPs they must believe her when she says there is “a very real risk” of Brexit not happeningher deal is voted down.But laying down the gauntlet to the PM on Sunday, former Tory leader Iain Duncan-Smith said she must tell Brussels to dump the backstop.IDS bluntly warned her: “If she doesn’t want to go back and renegotiate this, my view is my colleagues will want somebody that will”.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab echoed his call, adding: “Even in the event of a big loss on the vote which we expect, I think she could still turn it round.“But we need a change of approach.”Boris Johnson also slammed the backstop as “a legal lobster pot, in which we get trapped”.The former Foreign Secretary and Leave campaign boss also told the BBC he would “of course” take responsibilityworkers are laid off after Brexit, adding: “Do not underestimate the deep sense of personal responsibility I feel for Brexit and for everything that has happened”.Esther McVey accused former Cabinet minister colleagues of chickening out of a vote on Mrs May’s deal to avoid having to declare support for it.The ex-Work and Pensions Secretary, who resigned from the Cabinet over the agreement two weeks ago, called for a show of hands during a showdown five hour meeting to approve it.Ms McVey’s demand was refused and she was accused of having a “meltdown” over it.But on Sunday she angrily hit back to insist “the only meltdown” was from other Cabinet ministers to stop a vote so they “didn’t have to put their names to it”.For now it is, like the Monty Python parrot, an ex-deal.The MPs’ vote could trigger a series of events which end up with Jeremy Corbyn putting up portraits of Fidel Castro in No before Christmas.She would be wise to delay it — and use the time to talk with Brussels.Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said he’s available  , so we should use every hour we have to ensure a time-limit on, or an exit mechanism from, the hated backstop.It is better to go down fighting than meekly surrender.We’ve had quite enough of the latter over the last two years.Brussels may well not budge an inch.

The Lord of the Rings actor shared a hilarious leaked video from inside  Downing Street. The clip, which is almost three minutes long, sees motion capture legend Serkis combine the facial expressions and voice of Gollum, a fictional character from Lord of the Rings, with the much-maligned Tory politician.

As the increasingly isolated Prime Minister begins the most tumultuous week of her premiership, she will need that support more than ever. Mrs May’s backbenchers are deserting her in droves ahead of tomorrow’s crunch vote on her Brexit deal, when she is expected to suffer a crushing defeat. More ministers are considering quitting including aid secretary Penny Mordaunt who is said to be weighing up her future. Downing Street insiders say the PM has adopted a bunker mentality, relying on a small circle of trusted advisors to get her through the turbulent days ahead. Mrs May’s cabinet colleagues have grown increasingly frustrated at her reluctance to acknowledge the scale of defeat she faces. “She’s just not listening,” says one. “What’s the point of holding the voteit ends up devastating her Brexit deal and her leadership.”  But Number  insists the vote will take place tomorrow night as planned. “She knows the numbers,” insists a senior aide. A defeat would, they believe, strengthen her negotiating hand. Her weakness at home could end up being a strength with the EU. “She may need a Margaret Thatcher handbag moment with Brussels,” says one minister. “But she needs to have something to put in it.” Her closest aides insist she does have a Plan B. It is based on an amendment tabled by loyalist Tory backbencher Sir Hugo Swire. There may also be “a few other tweaks” including on fishing. But the EU says there is little room for manoeuvre.  The withdrawal agreement is finished business, although they may be able to offer some “helpful” language on the Irish backstop being temporary. But Brussels insiders are clear: any suggestion the Government could make plans to exit the backstop within a year is no-go. Mrs May’s team has ruled out the Norway Plus option because of her red line on free movement. Only a dferent leader could pivot to it, and it could split the party. Her closest advisors believe that a second referendum is the most likely outcome. “We’re not preparing for it and she doesn’t want it but it might be the only way. We think that’s where we’ll end up,” one said. For all the war-gaming, Number  knows it has no control over the PM’s own fate. Labour is not currently expected to put down a vote of confidence straight after the vote, instead waiting until the PM reveals her next move. The real danger comes from within. Tory backbenchers are febrile, with Brexiteers hinting they are - finally - not far off the  letters needed to kick off a contest. It is unclear whether enough would then vote against her. The public may not thank them for leaving the country leaderless at a time of crisis. But it is the Tory party’s “men in grey suits” that pose her biggest risk: senior cabinet ministers telling her that it is time to go. Mrs May is determined to hang on. Tory insiders say Philip May is learning French and German.

When she had not opened her eyes five days, doctors realised that adorable Lilien Molnar was blind. And at less than a week old she was diagnosed with two severe eye conditions, microphthalmia and coloboma.Coloboma - also known as cat-eye syndrome - can change the iris from its traditional shape to the narrow shape of a keyhole.Microphthalmia - also known as small eye syndrome - makes either one or both eyes abnormally small. Heartbroken parents David and Cintia have been told their daughter is probably the youngest person in the UK to be diagnosed with both conditions.But despite her blindness, Lilien is a happy baby who cant stop smiling.  Mrs Molnar, , from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, said: “Liliens eyes are the same size as a cats and will never grow properly. When they do grow they will look like a cats with the same line across them. “She’s our little girl and we want the best for her and we’ll do everything we can to make sure she has the best quality of le possible. “She can’t do things that most baby’s do because she can’t see. It can be really heartbreaking sometimes when we go out to see other children. Microphthalmia is an eye disorder which affects the size of the eyeball while coloboma creates a hole in the retina, leading to a cat like appearance. Lilien’s condition means that she is unable to play with most toys and has not yet shown any signs that she is beginning to crawl or move independently.  Mr Molnar, , said: “She can’t play with normal toys or do lots of things that most normal babies do so obviously that’s tough. “She can play with toys that emit lights or flash and she enjoys those but she can’t crawl or do things like that at all yet. “She smiles all the time though and that warms your heart.” At her  week scan, the mum was told Lilien was not growing sufficiently.

Experts spent nine months meticulously developing the state-of-the-art apartments which feature a ‘Woom’ bedroom with a cocoon-like bed, inspired by the safety and snugness of the womb. With muted lighting, soft pink walls and high-tech mattresses, each ‘Woom’ bedroom within The Zed Rooms has been designed to encourage positivity, relaxation and REM-rich sleep – the type of slumber which promotes learning and creates dreams. Engineered for optimum slumber away from home, the innovative apartments are a collaboration between sleep technology company, Simba and design-led serviced apartments Cuckooz, and are available to book in London’s Tech City, Shoreditch. Resident sleep psychologist at Simba, Hope Bastine, said: “If you’ve ever noticed that you don’t sleep as well in a hotel, you’re not alone.   “Scientists recognised the ‘first night effect’ over a decade ago, where one half of the brain unconsciously acts as a ‘night watchman’ staying more alert when in unfamiliar surroundings. “With this in mind, tapping into the emotional and physical, no stone has been left unturned trying to soothe the effects of this in the design architecture of our new cutting-edge sleep retreat.” During the last weeks of pregnancy, a baby increases its consumption of REM sleep, hitting a letime high of twelve hours a day in the final week before birth. There will be no other moment during a person’s le when they will get such a huge volume of REM sleep. Radiating the security and snugness of the womb, the state-of-the-art bedroom design aims to help mute the brain’s ‘red alert’ status it develops when sleeping in a new place.   Using insights rooted in the science of sleep, The Zed Room apartments have been designed to engage with every sensorial touchpoint of the body, creating an entire ecosystem that helps you to sleep from the moment you step through the door. The furniture’s rounded edges and softened corners mimic the sensation of bed, while rocking chairs are on hand to lull you into a relaxed state of mind. There are bespoke sleep recipe suggestions, rich in serotonin, melatonin and tryptophan, created in partnership with celebrity favourite, Detox Kitchen. Featuring restorative scents and colours that relax muscles, invoke calm and mimic the moonlight air cleansing soporic plants to eliminate toxins and healing background harmonies to unwind. Each apartment also comes complete with yoga mats and meditation sessions via the iPad’s Calm app. The second bedroom is also designed for dreaming, draped with luxurious ethereal fabrics and artwork to transport the mind. Steve Reid, co-founder of Simba, said: “The Zed Rooms aren’t a traditional getaway.  “They are geared entirely to honing quality sleep away from home. Fine tuning you overnight to navigate at whatever le throws at you the following day.” Co-founder of Cuckooz, Fabienne O’Neill, added: “We strive to be at the forefront of innovation within the hospitality sector and to push the boundaries when it comes to guest experience. “Design and wellbeing are at the heart of everything we do. We believe our homes should be more than an apartment.The Zed Rooms incorporate Simba’s award-winning Hybrid mattress, developed using complex body profiling data of  million sleepers, and temperature regulating pillows and duvets, using space-certied technology. It aims to deliver the ultimate restorative sleep environment for business travellers as well as those looking for the ultimate urban weekend retreat. Stays at The Zed Rooms start from pound night.

Six-year-old Riley Meredith-Morgan lost his two upper front teeth when the tool was thrown during an outdoor school forest lesson. The youngster is unable to eat or drink without using a straw - and will be toothless for Christmas as he waits to seethe adult teeth will grow back.A dental x-ray revealed a third set of teeth above the gum, but it could take up to six years for these to grow through, report Gloucestershire LiveMum Susan, , is disgusted after an external health and safety review investigated the incident and concluded it was an accident. Susan, a mum-of-three, claims she has not even had an apology from Rileys school, Severnbanks Primary in Lydney, Gloucestershire, following the incident on November . Susan was shocked when she saw Riley after getting a message to say he had been injured during forest school, which teaches children about natural woodland. She said: When I got to the school he was still in shock. My six-year-old boy had been hit in the mouth with a hammer and had his front teeth knocked out. It broke my heart to see him. He had to have time off school because of the severe discomfort and and he couldnt eat or drink without a straw. The injury itself is healing now but its not just the physical damage. I had to fight with him to get him back to school and I feel sick to my stomach every second he is there. The exact circumstances of the accident are unclear, but Susan claims it happened after a group of six-year-old boys were given a safety talk. Forest lessons, such as making campfires and learning practical woodland skills, are growing popular with schools. But Susan says more needs to be done to make the lessons safer after Rileys injuries. She said: They cant seem to see any safeguarding issue here and thats what bothers me. Something more needs to be done. I havent even had an apology from anyone involved. The lack of compassion is unreal, its diabolical.  She says a dentist told her the hammer must have hit Riley in the face with some force to have knocked his teeth out. The following day she was told the other child involved had been excluded for the rest of the day. The pupil then had to spend the following day in isolation. Susan was assured there would be an investigation, and the school referred the incident to external health and safety consultants - during which nobody asked Riley what had happened. And she was left angry to find out Rileys injury was concluded as an accident, and that the school deemed they had taken appropriate action. She said: The punishment for the child is not my issue. Accidents do happen. I just want justice for my boy. I left it over a week to see what they came back with and to seeI would have a written apology, but nothing.  They have left me with no choice but to let people know what happened. Susan says she does not want to take the easy option of removing her three children from the school, which is rated good by Ofsted. She says she will carry on fighting until somebody is brought to book for the accident which could have left Riley needing  teeth at the age of six. Rod Johnson, chairman of the governors at Severnbanks, said the health and safety of pupils has always been paramount at the school and will continue to be so. He said in a statement: The recent Ofsted report acknowledges that the school places pupils well being and safety at the heart of all it does.  The headteacher delegated the responsibility to the deputy head to investigate this matter to ensure it was dealt with impartially, and so there could be no inference of bias or prejudice. The school has followed its normal policies and procedures. An investigation has been undertaken of the incident including risk assessments and interviews with all parties involved. When an incident like this occurs, the school refers the incident to external health and safety consultants. They have considered all the evidence and it is their view that this was an accident.

Speaking on a YouTube video after his release, he said: I was ready to give up mentally and physically. He described his detention in an Egyptian hellhole and spoke of how he heard in the final days of his detention of the support he was receiving back home. While he was detained, his family were going out of their mind, according to a family friend - his sister was coughing up blood while his mum called on Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt to intervene. Egyptian security stopped Muhammed and the Libyan friend he was travelling with, after the hotel where he had booked his reservation reported his file as suspicious.  Officials searched through his belongings and said a photo of the military helicopter in the background was proof that the teenager was spying. Originally from the UK, Muhammed has Libyan and Pakistani heritage - and his family have been living in Libya in order to spend time with his ill grandmother, report Middle East Eye . They had planned toto the UK in the near future, having previously lived in Egypt for four years - and Abulkasem wanted to visit his old friends in the country before he started university next year.

The arch was to be flanked by six -ft storeys of rooms and galleries, containing homes, a granary, corn exchange, chapel, tavern, museums, general market, a library, a marine school offices and a stables, reports Bristol Live. The proposals were unveiled after Bristolian merchant William Vick left a bequest in his will of pound,and instructed that when the interest had reached pound, it should be used to construct a stone bridge.   However the plans were shelved after the French Revolutionary Wars broke out which affected trade and commerce. Financial firm Quid Corner have reconstructed Bridges idea to show how it would have looked.

Now, Joanna and her two young children face a cash-strapped Christmas in a house that doesnt feel like a home. She said: Ive cried every day. I was numb every day for weeks after and Im now on anti-depressants, reports Chronicle Live. The house isnt going to feel like a home this Christmas. The kids wont be able to have as much as they normally have.   After living in her house in Whitely Bay, North Tyneside, for nine years, Joanna decided to have a porch and downstairs bathroom extension fitted. Although she knew money would be tight, the mum pushed ahead with the plan to create the house of her dreams. In May, Joanna contacted a local builder who had been recommended by friends and asked him to do the job. She gave him a pound, deposit to buy materials after they agreed the work would be done by late June. In the beginning everything was great, she said. He would come every day and we actually used to get on.   The following month Joanna gave the builder another pound, to buy materials, but they never arrived. Her anxieties about the arrangement grew when he stopped turning up to work and the completion date came and went. Joanna said: We had a few arguments. Im sorry but when it got to six weeks past the due date and I couldnt see any evidence of work I said youre taking the mick and this is not good enough. In August, the builder stopped turning up at the house.   Despite persistent calls and emails from Joanna, he did not reimburse her the money to buy the materials. Joanna said she was left living in a house with exposed pipes and bare walls. She claims she had to pay a second builder to carry on the work, but she still cannot afford to have the whole job done.

Freja Ellis, three, was on a family break in Antalya, Turkey, when her mum Marlana treated her to get a black henna tattoo. But shortly after arriving back in the UK, Freja complained the cat design - which stretched from her wrist to her elbow - was itchy. The design erupted into a series of painful blisters and then became infected. The -year-old mother said: My little girl has been scarred for le after getting what I thought was a harmless black henna tattoo. She has been covered in blisters and in so much pain. Its been heartbreaking.  We were entirely unaware of the dangers and want to make sure other parents know what can happen so this doesnt affect other children. Nurse Marlana said her daughter had been begging for a tattoo after seeing older kids with them. She said they seemed really clean and tidy and because Frejas arm was wiped with an antiseptic wipe beforehand she wasnt too worried.  She said after they got home Freja began to complain of an itching and burning sensation just days later. Single mum-of-one Marlana from Herne Bay, Kent, said: Wed been home for about three days when Freja said: Mummy, my arm, its warm and its itching me. It hurts. I had a look, but there was nothing visible to the naked eye so I gave her some Calpol as she had a bit of a temperature and decided Id give it until the next day to seeshed improved. But when Freja woke up the next morning, she was in tears and a nasty blister had started to appear. She was constantly itching it and had very red, raw blisters full of fluid on her arm. Marlana rushed her daughter straight to the local minor injuries unit, the Queen Victoria, in Herne Bay, Kent and the doctor explained that black henna had been used which contains chemicals which can burn the skin. A chemical called para-phenylenediamine, or PPD, is added to henna to make the tattoos darker and increase their lespan. While PPD is present in many products, such as sun cream and hair dye, it is usually used in very small doses.  The addition of PPD into henna is now recognised as a public health issue, as this allergenic chemical often causes hypersensitivity reactions in children. Three days after the initial diagnosis, Marlana took Freja back to the GP to have her wound re-dressed as fluid was seeping through the bandages. The nightmare got worse when Marlana was told her daughters wound was infected and she was given a course of antibiotics. Now the infection has cleared up doctors are trying to get Frejas arm to scab over and heal.  I just dont want any other families to go through what we have, she said. Frejas tattoo will most definitely scar as the burn was quite deep - hopefully it will fade in time - but it will definitely leave a mark. I want to make people aware because so many children have them done on holiday. Frejas going to be scarred for le - shell forever have a cat on her arm.

He woke to find his flat covered in smoke, with flames spreading from the kitchen to the bathroom and landing. He launched a duvet over the fire but hadnt realised a deodorant can was inside.   It exploded, he said. It threw me back onto the bannister. When I got out of the flat I fell unconscious and thats when I woke up from a coma  hours later at Queens Medical Centre. I have lost everything. I am in a lot of debt anyway, but now I am in more debt because I did not have insurance. It has destroyed me.   Jack said he has spent pound, on surgery to look like his idol, which includes a nose job, chin implants, liposuction, botox, fillers and facials. He also buys the same clothes as David and has taken out loans to achieve his dream. His next target is his bone structure and he is looking at having three ribs removed so he can fit in the same waistcoats that David Beckham wears.  I am blacklisted everywhere [for credit], he said. I will carry on until I know I look like him. If I dont listen to my own mum, when she tells me to stop, I am not going to listen to everyone . I have got no problem with my appearance but I just want to be a David Beckham lookalike, the first person in Britain to look exactly like a celebrity through work being done.

In a swipe at her husband Prince Harry, , he said he told the duchess in an unanswered letter: “I’ve never played pool naked, nor have I dressed up as a Nazi.” Thomas, , also yesterday claimed he “no longer recognises” his daughter following allegations of dficult behaviour from the Duchess of Sussex since her wedding She has been dogged in recent weeks by rumours of a demands, am emails to staff and an alleged rt with Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge. In his latest outburst Thomas, a retired Hollywood lighting director, claimed his ex-actress daughter was “always demanding but never rude”. He added: “I don’t recognise this person.”   Thomas has been criticised for bringing up Harry’s past royal scandals, including dressing as a Nazi aged  and the naked photos of the prince leaked from Las Vegas in . Royal commentators have since praised Harry for transforming his image from party prince to hardworking royal. Yet Kensington Palace has been unable to silence Thomas’ public outcries over his bitter fall-out with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. It began when he was caught posing for paparazzi pictures ahead of the couple’s nuptials in May. A subsequent heart attack then left him too ill to attend the ceremony at St George’s Chapel, Windsor, where he was due to give away Meghan. In the latest of a series of controversial interviews, Thomas complained he had been frozen out by the royals and said his attempts to make peace had been met with a “wall of silence”.   His comments came as the palace dismissed fresh claims that a second trusted aide was quitting her role with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. It previously emerged that Meghan’s PA quit after just six months. Melissa Toubati, , is said to have been reduced to tears by her demands. It was claimed that the PA, once employed by Robbie Williams and his we Ayda Field, found working for the duchess overwhelming. A source said: “Her job was highly shypressurised and, in the end, it became too much. “She put up with quite a lot. Meghan put a lot of demands on her and it ended up with her in tears. “Melissa is a total professional and fantastic at her job, but things came to a head and it was easier for them both to go their separate ways.”   Reports have since claimed that Meghan and Harry’s private secretary Samantha Cohen, , is set to go the same way once the couple’s baby is born in the spring, after a -year career with the Royal Family. But officials have insisted her appointment with the newlyweds was always an interim post, adding the Australian native would be staying in the role until late  or early . Meghan, , lived with her father from the age of . Thomas claims he always taught her to have respect for those who work around her. He said: “I don’t want to say or do anything to hurt my daughter but I worry she is going to hurt herself. “Meghan grew up on set. I taught her to have respect for the crew. They can make you look good or awful. “I don’t pretend to know what she’s like now. She bends the rules, she’s good at that, but this acting up is new.” While Thomas has been left out in the cold, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland has been embraced by the royals.   After joining Meghan for a public appearance at the launch of her Grenfell Tower charity cookbook Together, rumours swirled Doria, , could be looking for UK base to be close to her daughter and grandchild. Thomas claims he has bombarded Meghan with letters and text messages, even driving to Los Angeles to hand-deliver a letter to Doria asking why he has been cut out. Meghan’s half-sister Samantha has joined calls for her to make peace with her dad. But the palace has remained resolutely tight-lipped. Meanwhile the duchess has thrown herself into royal le, taking on a royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.  Royal commentator Ingrid Seward said Thomas should not have brought up Prince Harry’s past gaffes, but said it was now up to Meghan to act. She said: “Meghan’s father is obviously very hurt and I feel some sympathy for him. He obviously feels isolated by his daughter not picking up the phone to call him. “There’s no need to have a shot at Harry, but he feels he hasn’t been well-treated by Harry and Meghan and he is many miles removed from the situation. There is always a way to resolve situations like this and that is down to Meghan. The more they shun him the more hurt he is going to feel.”  Perhaps most damaging to Meghan have been allegations of growing tension between her and sister-in-law Kate who, it was alleged, was “reduced to tears” by Meghan’s demands over Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid dress. Reports, denied by the palace, also claimed the pair clashed after Meghan “berated” a member of Kate’s staff. The Duchess of Cambridge reportedly told her: “That’s unacceptable. They’re my staff and I speak to them.” News that Harry and his bride are moving to Frogmore Cottage to start family le, rather than be neighbours with Kate and William at Kensington Palace, has done little to quell the rumours of a rt. The royal residence is in the grounds of Windsor Castle, nearly  miles outside London.

In a moving account of her struggles living on the new benefit system published by iNews, the anonymous woman spoke of the severe poverty affecting her family. In the run up to Christmas there will be no festive events for the family, who cannot afford to go ice-skating or visit the pantomime. In a bid to cheer up her home the woman has recycled old bottles and food containers, turning them into make-sht Christmas decorations. She hopes she will be able to get hold of a branch to use as a Christmas tree.   The woman said: I sometimes feel like stealing food from my friends cupboards and this hurts my heart. I look out of the window and envy people with cars who are going out, going to the cinema, affording hair cuts and new clothes while I struggle to get food every day. Thank you Universal Credit for the extra sadness and pain and hurt. Eager to stop such sadness affecting her daughter, the mum started collecting sugar packets from a cafe along with shampoo and pens from charity shops to put in her stocking. In another bid to spread some festive cheer she has plans to make Christmas crackers using free cosmetic samples and toilet rolls donated by her landlady.   The familys problems began when the woman moved town to get more support for her disabled daughter. Not being able to afford a removal van meant they were only able to bring a suitcase of clothes and school items. The familys lovely cats - who had provided emotional comfort to the daughter - had to be left behind. For Christmas dinner the family will tuck in to a small joint of gammon that the mum bought from the reduced section of a supermarket and has stored in a friends freezer. Not having access to an oven, she plans to use a clothes iron to heat up saucepans and some candles to boil water for coffee.   Although the mum does admit that she could have saved up each week in the months running up to Christmas, she was forced into debt earlier this year by emergency accommodation that cost nearly pound, a month. The familys dire financial circumstances mean the daughter goes to school each day without having had breakfast and unlikely to get any lunch, with only a selection of reduced sandwiches to look forward to when she comes home. The situation has left the woman feeling broken, undermined, useless and destroyed. When asked about the case a spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: The majority of people are comfortable managing their money but for those who struggle our Jobcentre staff are able to offer budgeting support. We have also recently agreed a partnership with Citizens Advice to help vulnerable people make their benefit claims.

At the time she was working as a care assistant and helped to brighten a paralysed patients day by giving her hugs. She said: One of my favourite patients was a middle-aged woman whod been paralysed. For years she hadnt been touched other than to be showered or moved, so when I first met her I askedshe wanted a hug.

Once in the room, we exchanged greetings and chatted for a few minutes. Then, keeping our clothes on, we lay on the bed, where I gently cuddled him for the next hour. She continued: Afterwards, my client said hed never felt more at ease and relaxed. It felt so good knowing Id helped him.

Morton on Saturday.And for inspiration they don’t have to look too far.Just like United were going into Friday night’s clash, Ayr were riding the crest of a wave at the start of the season.Seven wins and two draws from their opening nine fixtures of the campaign saw them continue the superb form that led them to the League One title last season.That run included a - win at Dens Park against Premiership Dundee, where the Honest Men completely outplayed the top-flight side, and a - home win over a Dunfermline side that had started the campaign strongly, too.Then, however, came their own shuddering halt to the form that had seen them sweep almost all before them on September  at Palmerston.Queen of the South had enjoyed a fairly up-and-down beginning to the season and weren’t expected to be the first team to stop Ayr’s momentum.A first-half blitz, however, shocked the rest of the Championship as Queens rattled up a four-goal lead inspired by their main man Stephen Dobbie and his partner-in-crime Gary Harkins.A hat-trick inside  minutes had the Doonhamers cruising before Harkins curled in against his old side with  minutes on the clock.Dobbie added a fourth in the closing stages to seal victory and give the Honest Men their first real test of the campaign.Many expected the wheels to come off at that point, as has happened to plenty of teams before, and for the newly- promoted Honest Men to fall back down the table.That looked the case the following week, too, as Falkirk, under new boss Ray McKinnon, raced into a - lead within  minutes at Somerset Park.However, that’s where the rot stopped – something Dundee United will be keen to emulate this coming Saturday, though they’d prefer not to give hosts Morton a lead first.The second half saw Lawrence Shankland find the net before a quickfire double from Andy Geggan and a Leo Fasan own goal gave Ayr the kind of response Robbie Neilson is desperate for.From there, McCall’s side have lost just the once – to Ross County – and drawn with Queens and Morton to regain top spot in the table.And they more than cemented that on Friday night at Tannadice.The question now for Dundee United is whether they can emulate their title rivals by getting back on form as quickly as possible.Victory against Morton would be one step closer to the manager’s goal of promotion while anything  would allow both Ayr and Ross County to open up a sizeable gap above the Tannadice club.However, Ayr have shown the Tangerines how to recover from a hammering – the test for Robbie Neilson and his men is whether they can do the same to get that “boulder” out of their way, starting on Saturday at Cappielow."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a4d2bd11e3.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds callum booth says ayr loss was a needed wake up call","story":"As tough as it was to take, Dundee United full-back Callum Booth believes last Friday’s - home defeat at the hands of Ayr was the wake-up call they needed at this stage of the season.Defender Booth admits it was a shock to the system for the Tangerines losing so heavily to the Championship leaders at Tannadice last week but insists the result is behind them as they aim to regain momentum built under new boss Robbie Neilson.The Terrors were unbeaten in six until the loss to The Honest Men and the -year-old feels they have got what it takes to go on a similar run – starting at Morton today.“We’d been doing brilliantly since the new manager came in and I don’t think anyone saw that scoreline coming at all,” the former Hibs and Partick Thistle left-back said.“It was a shock and maybe a bit of a wake-up call. We can’t take our foot off the gas and it was disappointing.“Look, I’m sure all the boys have experienced heavy defeats before and it’s not nice but, as the manager’s been saying, it’s about how you react.“The manager’s been brilliant at saying ‘look that’s us drawn a line under it’ and all our focus has been on getting back to winning ways and trying to get some positivity about the place and smiles on the boys faces again.“If we can go and win three or four games in a row then, hopefully, that result will be forgotten about.”And Booth feels the timing of their blip is a positive because there is plenty of time left this season to recty it.Following the game in Greenock today, United face Inverness in the Highlands as they aim to close the six-point gap on Ayr.And Booth insists that is the intention, saying he does not want to go through the turmoil of play-off disappointment again after last term’s relegation with Partick.He added: “They’re hugely important, absolutely massive games, especially with the gap at six points just now, they’re vital games.“We’ve two tough away games in Morton and Inverness coming up but we’ve been playing quite well away from home this season so, hopefully, that can continue and we can keep picking up results and close the gap over the festive period.“No one would really want play-offs but we’ll see what happens. Ayr have, obviously, been flying and they’re doing really well and County are up there as well but we’ve managed to narrow the gap to kind of make it a three-horse race.“We just need to get back on the same kind of run we were on before last Friday night, we’d been playing really well and were getting all the praise.“Hopefully, coming up to Christmas and New Year, we can put another run together and I’m confident we can.”Looking ahead to the game at Cappielow today, Booth is well aware Morton will be hurting, too, and look to recover after last weekend’s - loss to Dunfermline.“It will be a tough game. Their results have been up and down this season, they have some really good results and then, like last Saturday, not so good.“They probably deserved to win the game up at Tannadice earlier in the season, I think we scored a rd-minute equaliser.“It’s going to be a hard game but one we’ve prepared for well this week and go into it confident.“We’re both going into it on the end of two shocking results last weekend so it’s going to be about who reacts best to that.“Hopefully, with the squad we’ve got and how hard we’ve been working, then we’ll be the team that comes out on top.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a9db08ec57.jpg ","title":"lochee united fan alex hands back 500 of jackpot lottery win for new players lounge","story":"Lochee United season ticket holder Alex Marshall has handed back £ of his jackpot club lottery win to help fund a new players’ lounge.Alex received a £, windfall when his number came up and has given some back to be used for the redecorating of a lounge in tribute to a former player.Ian Anderson died in May while on holiday.

I enjoy cooking but I love interacting with the kids and seeing them react to new foods.“There is lots of job satisfaction.”Joyce prides herself on using only natural sugars in her meals and no salt.She also does more than just cooking the meals. She works with the children to teach them about new fruit and vegetables, how to cook simple foods and even how food is grown.Joyce added: “I like to try to sit with all of the kids and teach them about new foods.“We go out into the garden and plant vegetables and I also show them how to make meals.“We really want the children to be as independent as possible so we allow them to serve themselves food at lunchtime.“It is incredibly important to me for the kids to try new foods and textures so I make a lot of dferent meals each week and support the children to at least try things that they haven’t before.“It is amazing seeing kids who have been really fussy and wouldn’t eat anything that was cooked for them now sitting down helping themselves to their lunch.“I am really passionate about healthy snacks and lunches for the children and after  years doing this job I really couldn’t imagine myself doing anything  now. I love it.”Joyce’s food is not only a hit with the kids at Red Squirrel Nursery – she has also been nominated for a national award.She was put forward for the Nursery Management Awards Best Cook category by her former manager at Red Squirrel’s sister nursery.Joyce is one of only five finalists and the only representative from Scotland heading to the awards ceremony in London.She said: “Since I am the only finalist from Scotland I keep telling myself that evenI don’t win the national award I am still number one in Scotland.“I am hoping I have a good chance of winning the award.“The kids don’t really understand the signicance of it but all of the parents are really excited and supportive.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/Roundel-3-180x180.jpg ","title":"sponsored are you ready to switch on to a new energy landscape","story":"Our country’s power usage is changing. Thanks to smart meters we can all help keep the lights on.From our favourite gadgets to intelligent household appliances, whether we’re shopping, travelling or working, we’re increasingly looking to electricity to power us on.And we’re set to need it even more.For a start, the British Government wants  per cent of new vehicles to be powered by electricity by  and the sale of all new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans to end by .At the same time, greener energy sources such as wind and solar power are being introduced. ScottishPower recently became the first major UK energy company to announce plans to source all its electricity from wind.The nation’s energy landscape is undergoing rapid change.So how can we be sure that the lights stay on, and our electricity continues to be available at the flick of a switch Behind the scenes, Government and energy suppliers have been working hard to make sure the electricity network remains reliable while depending on unpredictable natural resources such as the wind to produce power.And closer to home, the arrival of millions of household smart meters means we can all play a part.By the end of the rollout, there should be  million gas and electricity smart meters in homes and small businesses across Britain, providing vital energy use information, which will also help plan for the country’s changing energy needs – such as increased demand for electricity with the mass adoption of electric vehicles.If we were all to drive our electric cars home after work and plug them in to charge overnight, our national grid would not be able to cope with the amount of electricity needed – i.e. the supply and demand for electricity would not be balanced and the network could find itself under strain.Smart metering and its near-real time transmission of energy data means suppliers will be able to regulate the amount of electricity powered through the grid, and ensure that we can keep our country’s lights on even in times when demand is highest.In simple terms, the energy suppliers will be able to more accurately predict how much energy to produce every hour of every day, to cope with our changing habits and ensure the country doesn’t ever face a blackout.And looking to the future, new flexible tarfs may allow people to use high-consumption items – like car charging points – at the cheapest times.With a nationwide network of smart meters in place, the electricity supply will be easier to maintain and give us greater reliability over our country’s power – good news for all of us.You can get your smart meter from your gas and electricity suppliers. vw, px\"  Smart Energy GB is the government backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the benefits of the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/shutterstock_494205820-376x564.jpg ","title":"sponsored how tech facilitates a smarter life for all","story":"We’ve come a long way from the first mobile phones and home computers.

Things like kettles, washing machines and dishwashers will have smart technology built in, and know when to switch on at the most energy efficient – therefore cheapest – times of day. But such innovations in household technology will only be possible once we all have smart meters, and our country is powered by smarter grids. Their near-real time transmission of energy data means suppliers can communicate with smart meters and such appliances to give them the information they need to optimise energy consumption.Rather than make people#s lives more complicated, advances in smart technology are working to make our lives simpler and more cost effective. vw, px\"  Smart Energy GB is the government backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the benefits of the smart meter rollout."},{"url":null,"title":"swansea city eye up move for dundee midfielder glen kamara","story":"Swansea City are eyeing up a move for Dundee’s star midfielder Glen Kamara, the Tele can reveal.The English Championship side were linked with a move for the Finnish international last summer, among a host of others.And with the -year-old available to sign on a pre-contract in January as he moves into the final six months of his contract, the Welsh club have stepped up their interest.Manager Graham Potter had a scout in attendance at Dens Park for Dundee’s impressive - victory over Hamilton on Wednesday.And the Swans will be keeping a keen eye on how Kamara fares against Steven Gerrard’s Rangers on Sunday.They are unlikely to be the only ones, however, with the Gers themselves and Old Firm rivals Celtic credited with interest in the summer while Hearts and Hibs are also keen on the former Arsenal man.Meanwhile, Dark Blues boss Jim McIntyre says the loss of centre-back Darren O’Dea is a blow as he prepares his side to take on Rangers on Sunday.The experienced defender has played a big part in Dundee’s recent revival under their new manager but limped off against Accies on Wednesday.And that calf injury is almost certain to keep him out of the weekend clash.Jim said: “Picking up the injury with Darren is a blow because him and Gensyhave done well together but there are other good players here who need to step in and show what they can do.”n Long-serving directer Steve Martin has retired from his position on the board.In a statement, Martin said a need to spend more time with his family and pursue other business interests was behind the decision."},{"url":null,"title":"teen drove at 61mph in 40mph zone on kingsway","story":"A teenage driver had sentence deferred until December  after admitting a speeding charge.Ross Buchan, , of Westholme Avenue, Aberdeen pleaded guilty by letter to a charge of driving a car at mph in a mph zone on the Kingsway, near Caird Park, on June .Sentence was deferred for Buchan to make a personal appearance."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0ab2d177bf6.jpg ","title":"tesco staff hand over 370 gifts for kids in dundee and perth","story":"Staff at the Tesco Customer Engagement Centre have been busy collecting for the Help for Kids Christmas toy appeal.This year the company handed over  gts to the charity so that a child in need across Dundee and Perth would have something to open on Christmas Day.Help for Kids manager Stacey Wallace said: “I just want to say thanks to everybody.

They have been with me through the ups and downs.“Without them, Mr P is just another wrestler. “In the other matches at Christmas Chaos, Damien will defend the Undisputed Title against Crusher Craib and the ing BT Gunn in a triple threat match.The WrestleZone Tag Team Titles are on the line as the Kings of Catch defend against the duo of Scotty Swt and Johnny Lions.Rising star Ryan Riley faces off against Jason Reed.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The fear, as Ann points out, is that we will end up with #hedgehog# views, skylines pricked by wind turbines in scenic areas.Some mind them, some don#t.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

The buildings on the main street and the front street just look sad.The front green for years has waited and unfortunately it still waits#this time for the council to clear away debris after a storm.Come on # the place looks bad enough. Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead opens up for christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowShop locally or risk losing our distinctive shops.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

make her mark.In  she became the first professor of politics in the whole of Ireland.A colleague remembered that she came to Queenrsquos as a breath of fresh air, in part because her appointment marked two interesting vital departures for Queenrsquos ndash the appointment of women to senior professorships in the social sciences and the European focus she gave Politics at the University. She pioneered these two developments and helped reshape the University very signicantly.Elizabeth held many positions, including Dean, at Queens University before her retirement in .Away from the lecture rooms her research interests incorporated the politics of devolution, governance and accountability in the UK, and the role of the European Union in framing relations between Britain and Ireland - and she wrote and edited eight books, many journal articles, and numerous chapter contributions to signicant collections on the subjects.In  she became a Commissioner of the Fair Employment Commission of Northern Ireland, and two years later was appointed to the advisory board of the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.And a year later became director of the think-tank, Democratic Dialogue.Her work towards gender equality in politics was highlighted by her involvement in the Northern Ireland Womens Coalition.She hosted many Coalition meetings in her home, where the partyrsquos policies were shaped and formed.And she often told with obvious glee the story of how the Coalition out-manoeuvered the naysayers just as the result of the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement was being announced.Coalition members, including Elizabeth, and other political parties were gathered at the count centre in the Kings Hall, Belfast for the announcement.As the television cameras of the world were poised to film political reaction to the result, a senior politician opposed to the Agreement moved to take centre stage.In a moment of co-ordinated inspiration, the Womenrsquos Coalition members, including Elizabeth, danced joyously in front of the politician, cutting off his access to the microphone.The image conveyed to the world was that of celebration, reflecting the overwhelming endorsement of the Agreement on the island.Elizabeths portrait, which was commissioned in , hangs in Queens University Hall.Professor Elizabeth Meehan died at her home in West Linton on Saturday, January ."},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-to-benefit-from-angelas-brashes","story":"A Peebles photographer is using her skills to raise cash for local groups and charities this Christmas.Angela Preston has turned a wintery image she captured of the Scott Brash sculpture, next to Edinburgh Road, into a Christmas card.Angela took the image of the iron sculpture last January during a snowfall and, after the photo received a positive reaction on social media, decided to turn it into a festive card.As co-founder of the not-for-profit organization A Gt for Peebles, she opted to sell the card to raise funds for the organization which in turn supports several local groups and charities.Angela said: ldquoThe Scott Brash sculpture is a magnicent welcome to our town and looked even more striking covered in snow.

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"andy-serkis-brings-back-gollum-for-theresa-may-spoof","story":"Gollum actor Andy Serkis has revived his Gollum character from the Lord Of the Rings films to poke fun at Prime Minister Theresa May and her Brexit plans.The Hollywood actor, known for his motion-capture work playing CGI characters, donned a Conservative-blue jacket and grey wig for the sketch titled ldquoLEAKED: Footage From Inside No  Downing Street!ldquoPrecious hellip our agreement, this is it.

range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted.

They had just had their first child and Jacine, who worked in corporate marketing, was mulling over ways to better achieve a work-le balance.\"The nine-to-five wasnt working,\" she recalls. \"I wanted to spend more time with my daughter Mahya when she was still young. I felt bad going back to work when she was nine months old and putting her into nursery. Everything came to a head.\"Jacine, , decided to take a three-month sabbatical from her job so they could stay on in Uganda and figure out a plan. \"By the end of that three months we decided to start a business,\" she says.That business was making rum. Jacine, who grew up in South London, has proud Jamaican roots. Her grandparents were part of the Windrush generation who had arrived in the UK during the s.\"I married into a beautul Ugandan family and spent a lot of time in Uganda and Kenya where I had seen lots of sugar cane,\" she says. \"I was asking for rum and I was never able to get any. I found this very confusing and would say: Do you know what we do with the sugar cane in Jamaica \"That got us thinking: Why is there no rum coming out of Uganda when there is sugar cane here  and Where are all the African rums on the global stage  Then we looked wider beyond rum at where Africa figures in the world of fine spirits.\"The continent gets flooded with spirits made all over the world but in terms of home-grown African spirits ndash considering the amazing natural produce ndash we were perplexed at how few there were. It became a mission to showcase Africa in the world of fine spirits.\"Pauls favourite tipple has long been whisky. \"We dont really drink rum in East Africa,\" he says. \"For me, marrying into a Caribbean family was an education. My drink was always Scotch whisky, but when you go to a Caribbean party, you cant really bring Scotch whisky hellip\"Jacine shakes her head, laughing heartily at the notion. \"Her relatives taught me about Jamaican rum and introduced me to all the brands,\" Paul adds. \"It made me wonder why I had never tried rum before. When it is made well it is a beautul spirit.\"Together the couple began to learn more about rums from across the Caribbean islands while pondering how to make their own East African iety. \"We had the idea to launch Matugga not having any experience in the sector,\" says Jacine. \"We saw a gap in the market and went for it.\"Everything had to reflect our positioning which was Africa and the UK ndash this interesting duality ndash and nobody  was doing that. We also had the innovative idea for our rum to be smoky. That is because this gentleman\" ndash she gestures to her husband ndash \"is a Scotch whisky man.\"This gave birth to Matugga Golden Rum followed soon after by Matugga Spiced Rum with Paul, , spending hours in the kitchen ndash the collateral damage his singed eyebrows ndash as he attempted to nail the perfect combination of botanicals .\"The one thing that is spiced across East Africa is tea,\" he says. \"It doesnt matter where you go, there is a masala chai that they do. We selected five spices ndash ginger, cloves, vanilla, cardamom and cinnamon ndash plus the tea to go into our rum.\"The molasses are sourced from Tanzania and Kenya. \"We wanted to use molasses from Uganda, but the Ugandan sugar market is a bit unpredictable and volatile,\" says Paul. \"We thoughtwe spread it across East Africa, we can still get themthere are any price fluctuations.\"It is three years since they first unveiled Matugga at the London Rum Festival. Initially the duo worked with a contract distiller but since moving to Scotland have been able to begin production in their own facility at Brucefield Industry Park, West Lothian.Their move to Scotland came about when Paul, a civil engineer by trade, began studying for an MSc in Brewing and Distilling at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The couple have fallen in love with their new base since arriving last year. Livingston is home now.Paul is the master distiller for Matugga with Jacine, who has experience in business start-ups alongside her marketing background, taking on the role as CEO.They make an impressive and formidable team. Jacine is the more outgoing of the two, warm and gregarious, while Paul is a little shyer and softly spoken but clearly every bit as driven as his we. He admits that ideas for new recipes are constantly percolating in his mind.Later, when Jacine is getting her photograph taken over by the rum casks, Paul talks me through some his latest \"experiments\" for future Matugga limited edition expressions. His eyes light up as he speaks. This is a man who has clearly found his vocation.\"I almost cant sleep at night,\" he says with a grin. \"I have so many ideas. It is only through having our own distillery that you begin to realise what is possible. You dont really understand a spirit until you have smelled and tasted it being made from the start.\"By doing that you get to know where all those little flavours come from, the bits that you dont usually get to taste because they never make it to the bottle. It is a huge spectrum.\"His latest prototype, says Jacine, has sent them down a new and unexpected road. A ripple of excitement passes between them as they talk about the future. \"There is definitely going to be more,\" they say in unison.\"We have released a Mavuno range with a special edition each year,\" says Paul. Beside him, Jacine adds: \"We use a lot of Swahili ndash the language of East Africa ndash and Mavuno means harvest. This is the harvest of Pauls experimentation. We will do , bottles in that edition.\"The distillery ndash believed to be the first of its kind in central Scotland ndash is equipped with two -litre copper pot stills, capable of producing , litres of artisanal rum in its first year, the equivalent of two million single rum serves.Over the next  months, Matugga is forecasting a  per cent increase in turnover and hoping to create five new full-time roles including positions in distilling and business development.In recent weeks, they have undertaken crowdfunding which has netted pound, to support the couples ambitious expansion plans. One of the options offered to those who contributed was the opportunity to purchase a private rum cask.\"Similar to whisky cask ownership, you would buy a rum cask and we would look after it for three years,\" says Paul. \"Rum doesnt need a long maturation phase. We project within three years it would be very delicious and ready for bottling.\"We think that will coincide with the point that rum becomes the next thing. If you are going to buy a cask, you dont want to buy it in three years time, you want to buy it now.\"Over the past decade, the gin-making industry has mushroomed in Scotland with a raft of new distilleries and craft brands. According to Scotland Food and Drink,  per cent of the UKs gin is produced here and sales are expected to hit pound.bn by . Could rum go the same way Paul and Jacine certainly hope so. Matugga is among a handful of dedicated rum distilleries in Scotland. Dark Matter Distillers in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, launched in  and Wester Spirit Rum, thought to be Glasgows first rum distillery in  years, opened last month.Moray-based Beach Craft Spirits produces three ieties of small batch rum including sloe and spiced. NB Distillery in North Berwick, known for its gin and vodka, recently added rum to its portfolio. The Strathearn Distillery in Perthshire introduced Dunedin Rum in .Paul and Jacine believe that over the next few years we will see more rum brands springing up across Scotland. They are delighted to be at the forefront of that revolution. \"The magical thing is that now we are here, places have really inspired us,\" says Jacine.\"We are talking about bringing Africa to Scotland, but we want to showcase our own foraging and exploring Scotland in terms of flavours. It is about discovery for us.\"We are working on a new line that had so much goodwill from people in Livingston and beyond. They seem to be really excited about what we are doing.\"It has all been really positive. It is an adventure. We honestly didnt know how we were going to be received. We rocked up here with our family and were hoping everyone would be welcoming, which they have been. There has been a lot of excitement.\"Pauls love of whisky was a big factor in their choice of base. \"Absolutely,\" he says. \"It could only be Scotland. The quality of Scotch whisky is the highest in the world in terms of distilled spirits and I knew thatwe were going to align ourselves with good standards it was going to be in Scotland.\"He has found other upsides too. \"The benefit of Scottish water is that there are not a lot of minerals in it. It is very soft water. You can imagineyou had a kettle down south, the inside would be covered in white stuff.\"We would have to remove all that stuff from the water and it would clog up the purication filter. It is an absolute nightmare to make wine, beer or spirits from.\"The water here is fantastic for brewing and distilling. The weather helps, too, because we generally have cool temperatures and a moderate summer in Scotland, so we are not over-ageing our rum stock. It is gently maturing in a way you can control it.\"If you were distilling, for example, in the United Arab Emirates you would need to put the casks in a basement with air conditioning. Scotland is perfect to mature spirits.\"The name Matugga comes from family owned land in Uganda. \"Traditionally in Uganda when you get married your father gives you a piece of land to grow crops and feed your family,\" says Paul.\"My brother was given a piece of land he didnt particularly like, so he decided to sell it and buy land with my mum in Matugga. My mum really fell in love with this piece of land. She was an agriculturist and teacher of farming. My mum farmed that land with such passion.\"After his mother passed away in , the -acre expanse took on an even more special meaning. \"I remember standing there thinking: This is amazing,\" says Paul. \"Most of it is unspoiled. It is not savannah ndash this is green. There are passion fruit vines growing, some chillies. It is beautul.\"My brother told me stories about how it used to be a sugar cane plantation and when they first bought it, they found all this kit for harvesting sugar cane. I thought: I think we are being told something here. We are being told to do something that is sugar cane based hellip\"Jacine takes up the thread. \"It was a very spiritual time,\" she says. \"My family is from Jamaica and Africa is my heritage. It was almost like a homecoming and being welcomed by my Ugandan family.\"It was where we had the idea to make rum. This land represents Uganda and the whole continent. It has beauty and serenity and all the wonderful produce. It became the heartbeat of our brand.\"Visit matuggarum"},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-labour-would-scrap-thatcher-trade-union-restrictions-and-allow-sympathy-strikes","story":"Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the policy, which would unpick legislation introduced by the Thatcher Government, echoed the action of striking workers who took a stand against the fascist Pinochet regime in the s.However, the Conservatives hit out at the ldquoludicrous move which they claimed would take the country in the wrong direction.Secondary action, otherwise known as sympathy strikes, can occur when trade union members take industrial action in support of workers who are employed by a dferent organisation.Conservative Governments in the s clamped down on the practice amid concerns that unions had too much power.Tony Blair accepted the curbs and Labourrsquos  manesto was firm in that there would be no repeal of the laws passed by his predecessors.ldquoWe make it clear that there will be noto flying pickets, secondary [sympathy] action, strikes with no ballots or the trade union law of the s, it stated.The Labour Governments employment relations white paper from  also made it explicit that the days of secondary action were ldquoover.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and McDonnell, who are on the Left of the party, have since said they support the right to go on a sympathy strike, but no commitment was made in Labourrsquos last general election manestoHowever an award winning film, Nae Pasaran, has put the issue of secondary action back into the spotlight.Staff at the Rolls-Royce factory in East Kilbride showed their support for the people of Chile - whose democracy had been overthrown by a military dictatorship - by refusing to carry out repairs of fighter aircraft used by Pinochetrsquos supporters.McDonnell said yesterday: ldquoThat group of Scottish workers took a courageous and humane act against the horrors of the Pinochet years.ldquoSuch collective action and acts of solidarity have been attacked and undermined by restrictive anti-union laws started in the s under Thatcherrsquos Tory government.ldquoThe next Labour government will ensure workers can revive the spirit of the Rolls-Royce workers in East Kilbride, when they struck a blow against the brutal Pinochet dictatorship.ldquoIn this way, we will open the next chapter of democratic society by enhancing democracy at work.He added: ldquoOur programme of workplace reform will restore the balance between employer and worker, and it will do so by installing basic trade union rights in law again.ldquoWe will introduce a new Ministry of Labour to give workers a voice in parliament, sectoral collective bargaining to raise wages and conditions, and repeal dangerous anti-trade union legislation.Asked specicallyLabour would repeal the restrictions on secondary strike action introduced in the s, he said: ldquoYes.Labour is also committed to introducing electronic balloting for industrial action, which the unions believe would make it easier to trigger strikes.Scottish Conservative MP John Lamont said: ldquoThis is a ludicrous suggestion from the Labour Party that yet again shows they want to take us back to the s.

It was a bottle of South African sparkling wine by the vintner Graham Beck. The wine was good, but it wasnrsquot special - it was the occasion which made the wine great.It was  years ago, and Hoyrsquos we Mary had just given birth to their first baby Emily. The couple were living in South Africa, working in the wine business, and after their daughterrsquos christening, Justin and Mary journeyed into the bush and drank the sparkling Beck amid one of the most beautul landscapes on earth with their newborn baby beside them.lsquoIt was probably not the best sparkling wine in the world, but for that occasion it was absolutely perfect,rsquo says Hoy. Thatrsquos what wine does, it underscores the events in le which matter. Mary laughs and says hersquos making them sound like terrible parents, drinking in the wild with their baby.Hoy hates the expression lsquowine expertrsquo but like it or not thatrsquos what he is, one of Scotlandrsquos best connoisseurs. Spend an hour in his company and yoursquoll learn more about wine than you could from a decade of experimenting as an amateur wine buff on your own.As National Wine Week comes to an end today, Hoy is singing the praises of wine and the role it plays in human culture and society. Wine has been with us for at least  years - the earliest archaeological record of wine-making is dated to about BC in Armenia. Wine writer Aaron Pott says there is a theory, though, that wine is much older - that wine began when some ancient human lsquochanced upon some wild vines in late fall, their bunches well past ripe, rotten and slightly fuzzy with a blush of mouldrsquo. They would have tasted the sticky juice and become euphoric - and so wine quickly became part of religion as it seemed to connect us to the gods. The ancient Greeks and Romans deied wine in the rites of Dionysius and Bacchus - and it remains embedded in our culture today.lsquoWine is so important in society as we use it as the major part of any celebration,rsquo Hoy says. lsquoHumans are incredibly gregarious, we love celebrating and will find any reason to be together whether itrsquos a birth, christening, marriage, finishing school - we find reasons to have a celebration, and the major part of that celebration is when wersquore toasting whoever it is thatrsquos getting married or winning a race.lsquoTake that same idea across to a dinner party. It doesnrsquot matter how many people are coming, when they cross your doorstep yoursquoll give them a beer or a gin and tonic, but thatrsquos not why you invited them - the reason you invited them is that part of the evening when yoursquore all sitting around the table focused on each other and having a good time and the food comes out and yoursquoll notice all the other drinks go out the window and are replaced by wine - wine becomes the centre of the table. We change to wine as that is the celebratory part of the evening. Thatrsquos the importance of wine, itrsquos all about the occasion. Itrsquos how we celebrate.rsquoHoy has spent his le in the wine trade. Born in England, he married a Scot and the pair went to South Africa to run a vineyard. He later moved back to Scotland, where he now runs the Glasgow Wine School.The secret to winersquos beloved role in human le is its connection to food and social interaction. Sure, says Hoy, you can drink it to lsquoget pissedrsquo but therersquos much more to wine than that - unlike other drinks which exist primarily to get you drunk.Food is at the heart of every culture on earth, and wine elevates food. Wine is completely natural, like the best food - itrsquos just grape juice, yeast and sunshine. In wine, itrsquos the acidity and the tannins - the chemicals extracted from the grape skin that dry the mouth - which, when matched with a simple plate of food, can create something sublime. Other alcoholic drinks donrsquot have the same type of acidity thatrsquos found in white wine or the tannins in red wine.lsquoAcidity is a really good palate cleanseryou are eating fatty food,rsquo says Hoy. lsquoOne of the most magical food and wine parings is champagne and fish and chips.rsquo The fatty, oily fish and chips coat the inside of the mouth, and that deadens taste buds leaving the brain bored with whatrsquos being eaten. A sip of acidic champagne washes the mouth clean and the palate is ready to experience the taste of fish and chips all over again.With tannins itrsquos all about the interaction with salt - think of a hearty stew or a bowl of spaghetti bolognese, a lot of the flavour comes from the salt in the food. lsquoSalt suppresses the perception of tannins,rsquo Hoy says, lsquoand once it does that it gives the impression of the wine being more fruity. One of the things we know works really well is a nice big steak with an Argentinian Malbec [a red] - itrsquos become one of the great things in le. Malbec has a very high tannin level and when we cook steaks therersquos salt in the cooking process, so put them together and suddenly the wine becomes this juicy drink.rsquoHoyrsquos tip for matching food and wine is simple - lsquothe more flavour you have in your food, the more flavour you should have in your winersquo. He gives the example of a dinner of smoked fish with a cream sauce. lsquoThe sauce is where your fattiness will come through, so you will need a bit of acidity in your wine. If you tried to match a Sauvignon Blanc the flavours of the dish would overpower the wine as it doesnrsquot have a huge amount of flavour necessarily - butyou changed that Sauvignon Blanc into a nice wooded Chardonnay the wine will stand up to the food and still have the acidity.rsquoWith something like a green salad, though, a wooded Chardonnay would kill the delicate summery taste, but a Sauvignon Blanc is probably perfect. The worst food and wine matching, says Hoy, is red wine with dessert. The clash of sugar and tannin is frankly disgusting - so what you need is a desert wine, something like a Sauterne. lsquoThe wine you are drinking must always be sweeter than the food you are eating,rsquo says Hoy.Hoy wants to remove all the snobbery from wine. Getting the right drink to go with the right food shouldnrsquot be the domain of the middle classes - itrsquos about taste, not money, and we all have taste. Of course, many wines arenrsquot cheap, but over the years low cost wines have filled supermarkets and a half decent red or white can be picked up for the same price as a six pack of beeryou know what you are looking for, and what food will go with it.Jay McInerney, the acclaimed American novelist and wine writer, says having less money will make you a more astute wine drinker as you are lsquoforced to make choices and sacrices that can only sharpenrsquo discrimination and appreciation. lsquoStarting at the top, one will miss out on the climb,rsquo he says.McInerney makes discovering wine sound like a mysterious journey, and indeed there is something deeply mysterious about wine. The film Sideways is adored by wine drinkers as itrsquos a tragi-comic love story wrapped in a homage to the vineyard. In the film, one of characters, Maya, has a speech in which she talks about wine asitrsquos almost human. lsquoI like to think about the le of wine,rsquo she says, lsquohow itrsquos a living thing. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing how the sun was shiningit rained. I like to think about all the people who tended and picked the grapes. Andits an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I like how wine continues to evolve, likeI opened a bottle of wine today it would taste dferent thanId opened it on any other day, because a bottle of wine is actually alive. And its constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peakshellip and then it begins its steady, inevitable decline.rsquoFor Hoy, wine is about simplicity. A winemaker in ancient Rome could make as good a wine as the wealthiest and best equipped vineyard owner today. lsquoIrsquove seen people make the most astounding wines in plastic tanks,rsquo Hoy says. lsquoIrsquove worked in some vineyards in France where the equipment was as old as the hills and I thought there was no way you can produce decent wine here, but you taste the wines and theyrsquore remarkable. The very best wines in the world are the ones where the wine-maker is working with what nature has given them - not adding or taking anything away.rsquoThose great wines are down to what the French call lsquoterroirrsquo - the land, the environment in which the grape is grown. The secret is getting the right grape for the right soil and climate. Once that sweet spot - that Goldilocks zone - has been found then nature will take her course.Of course, not everyone is in love with wine. The writer Rory Sutherland finds itrsquos the snobbery that kills. lsquoFor the drinker to demonstrate status and connoisseurship,rsquo he says, wine must become lsquoabsurdly hard to navigate, so providing opportunities for contrived, hair-splitting distinctions that let the buyer advertise his own discernment.rsquoOthers, quite rightly, worry about health effects, like Dr Susan Biali, a wine drinker whorsquos now more or less on the wagon. lsquoI love wine,rsquo she says, but she admits to an addictive personality and recalls the aggressive breast cancer her mother had in her s. When Biali heard the renowned Hard-trained gynaecologist Sara Gottfried say lsquowhat you think wine is giving you, itrsquos actually taking awayrsquo, she decided to quit. lsquoThe truth of this resonated so completely with me that it pushed me over the edge. No more wine, or alcohol, period, except on the rarest occasions like a special dinner.rsquoOthers simply hate wine because of the taste. Author Anne Fadiman is the daughter of the late, great wine critic, Clton Fadiman, but she detests Bordeauxs, Burgundys, Pinot Noirs, and Pinot Grigos. Therersquos not a wine she likes - and thatrsquos because shersquos as near as it comes to a supertaster - someone with a higher than average number of tastebuds who can be overpowered by strong flavours. lsquoAs other women fake orgasms, I have faked hundreds of satisfied responses to hundreds of glasses,rsquo she says.Luckily, for the Glasgow Wine School, supertasters are relatively few and far between - therersquos certainly none at the schoolrsquos latest wine tasting evening. Mike Cottam is leading a dozen or so people - of all ages and backgrounds - through the basics of how to get the best from a glass of wine.Each person is concentrating solely on the most sensory experience for a human outside of sex - taste. As they sip and slurp and swirl it seems asthe mouth is the very centre of their being - and perhaps it is, can you imagine how dead le would be without taste One of the tasters, Alec McLean, says wine is about simple pleasures. lsquoItrsquos about taste,rsquo he says, lsquorelaxation. Itrsquos about being slow in a busy world. Itrsquos also about story - where did the wine come from, who made it, and why. Itrsquos not mass produced, itrsquos real. Thatrsquos a rarity these days.rsquoTASTING TIPS: HOW TO DRINK WINE LIKE A CONNOISSEURIf you want a quick guide on how to taste wine, then Madeline Puckette and Justine Hammack at the company Wine Folly are your go-to connoisseurs.They say follow the four simple steps of look, smell, taste and conclude, and yoursquoll be able to navigate the complex world of wine with ease.LOOKYou can tell a lot just by how a wine looks.Tilt the glass over a white backdrop to inspect the colour. The paler the colour at the edge the younger the wine. In a white, a deep gold will be oaked. The darker the red, the higher the tannin.Swirl the wine to see how viscous it is -the wine lsquolegsrsquoare slow then the alcohol is high. Swirling also oxygenates the wine letting flavour out.SMELLHold the glass just under your nose and give it a quick snf to lsquoprimersquo your nose. Swirl, and then get your nose right in the glass and take a deep snf. Now think about what those smells remind you of - donrsquot be scared to move your nose around in the glass as rich fruit smells and more floral smells can gather in dferent places.If your nose gets lsquooverloadedrsquo snf your forearm to neutralise all those wine smells. Donrsquot wear perfume.In wine, the primary aromas are from the grapes. So a Sauvignon Blanc will smell like gooseberries or grass. Secondary aromas come from the winemaking process, and reactions with yeast and bacteria. So the buttery smell in Chardonnay comes from a type of bacteria. Tertiary aromas are from the ageing process - thatrsquos what gives Champagne its nutty flavour.TASTECoat your mouth with a large sip followed by smaller sips. Sloosh it around in your mouth and draw air in through your teeth. Try to pick out at least three fruit flavours and three other flavours. You donrsquot need to spit wine out.Think about the basic tastes of wine. Sweetness is at the front of the mouth. Acidity makes your mouth water. Tannin dries the mouth - the Wine Folly folk say itrsquos like a lsquowet teabagrsquo. Alcohol creates heat at the back of the mouth.Wine lsquoevolvesrsquo on your palate. A Syrah, for example, tastes very strong for a short period of time. A Cabernet Sauvignon builds on the palette and then fades gradually. A Pinot Noir is subtle, never overpowering the mouth and has a long finish - meaning the taste lingers over time.CONCLUDEThis is where you begin to build your expertise. Was the wine balanced  Did one flavour overpower another Think about the key traits of the wine and keep them in your memory to use when tasting other wines.Try blind tasting with friends - and see how you all react to each wine.Start with single-ietals - thatrsquos one type of grape such as a Chardonnay or a Merlot - so you can work out how each grape tastes.Try the same grape but from dferent regions - like France, Chile or New Zealand.Be honest - decide what type of wine you like, not what type of wine you are told you should like.Wine Folly use a four point rating system - from bleh, to meh, then yeah, and finally last meal, as in this is the wine yoursquod have with your last meal on earth.Drink sensibly."},{"url":null,"title":"experts-call-on-snp-government-to-back-5-child-benefit-rise-in-budget","story":"The experts issued their demand days after a new report revealed that nearly a quarter of a million children north of the border are in poverty.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard backed the call: \"Children living in poverty cannot wait several years for these additional funds - they need them now.\"Following the independence referendum, the cross-party Smith Commission led to Holyrood acquiring new powers over taxation and social security.Among the basket of powers given to MSPs was the ability to create new benefits and top-up existing programmes reserved to Westminster.The SNP Government has since confirmed it will introduce an income supplement by , although Ministers have yet to decide on what form it will take.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, around one million Scots are in poverty, of which , are children.In two separate letters, a range of senior figures have called on the Government to bring forward their top-up plan by announcing an income boost in Wednesdayrsquos Budget.Their preferred option is to increase child benefit, which is currently set at pound. a week for the first child, by pound, in line with the high-profile lsquoGive Me Fiversquo campaign.In their letter to Mackay, four senior church figures - Church of Scotland Moderator Rt Rev Susan Brown, The Most Rev Mark Strange of the Scottish Episcopal Church, Joan Cook of the Scottish Unitarian Association, and Bishop William Nolan - wrote:ldquoThere is a compelling argument to act with greater urgency in implementing the income supplement. Given the levels of poverty that currently exist in Scotland, we urge you to consider using the budget to deliver the income supplement in the next year, rather than by the current timescale of .ldquoDoing so would reflect the great need that families across Scotland must be lted out of poverty right now, rather than in several yearsrsquo time.\"They added: ldquoAs supporters of the Give Me Five campaign, we ask that ndash as well as bringing forward the delivery of the supplement ndash you also consider doing so via topping up child benefit, which would immediately lt tens of thousands of children out of poverty.In the second letter to the Finance Secretary, over twenty prominent iniduals called for child benefit to be increased.These include Satwat Rehman at One Parent Families Scotland, Children st Chief Executive Mary Glasgow, Scottish Drugs Forum CEO David Liddell, STUC General Secretary Grahame Smith, Poverty Alliance Director Peter Kelly and Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland Director John Dickie.It also included senior figures in Cranhill Development Trust, childrenrsquos charity Aberlour, Justice and Peace Scotland, Energy Action Scotland, Close the Gap and Engender.They wrote: ldquoAs a non-means tested entitlement, it [child benefit] has a high take-up rate and is less expensive to administer, and we continue to believe that topping up child benefit would represent a most effective and impactful way of delivering the new income supplement.The signatories also stated that they are ldquoseriously concerned that the  timescale for an income top up is ldquonot reflective of the urgency with which it is required.Dickie said: ldquoThese letters demonstrate the extraordinary breadth and depth of support across Scotland for an immediate boost to family incomes to help tackle the devastating hardship too many children are facing.ldquoAlong with faith groups, trade unions and childrens charities we urge the Finance Secretary to prioritise financial support for families as a matter of urgency. A pound top up to child benefit would be one way of lting thousands of children out of poverty and protecting many more from the damage poverty wreaks.The SNP has so far resisted the policy on the grounds that the payment would benefit families not in poverty.SNP Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: ldquoScotland is the only part of the UK to have ambitious targets to reduce, and ultimately eradicate, child poverty. We are developing a new income supplement to provide additional financial support to families who need it most as research shows that topping up Child Benefit, which remains reserved to the UK Government, is not the most efficient or effective way to lt children out of poverty, nor would it be quick or simple.However, the Government is facingpolitical pressure to back the pound a week increase, as the Greens and Scottish Labour are in favour of the move.Leonard said: \"This is a hugely signicant intervention in the budget debate by faith leaders, charities, anti-poverty campaigns and the STUC uniting to call for Scotlands powers to be used in the interests of the many, not the few.\"Derek Mackay must listen to these church leaders, charities and Labour and raise Child Benefit by pound per week in his budget on Wednesday.\"This would lt around , children out of poverty and help families across Scotland.\"Scottish Greens MSP Alison Johnstone said: \"Topping up Child Benefit was a Green manesto proposal that would lt thousands of families out of poverty.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Monday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118675.jpg","title":"Xmas hampers with a little muscle tow","story":"GYM owner Kris Hamilton will be flexing his biceps ahead of his annual sleigh pull from Thurso to Wick.Every year, Kris puts on his Santa Claus outfit and takes the role of the reindeer as he pulls a sleighful of hampers between the two towns.The hampers ndash which will be towed by Kris on December  ndash will be packed full of food, drink and clothing, and delivered to the elderly and some of the most vulnerable residents of Caithness.Its Kriss fth year at the helm, and while many applaud his fine efforts ndash the hampers being delivered to the east Caithness offices of NHS Highlands Care at Home services ndash they may well wonder why he takes on such an arduous task.Kris ndash who runs the Hamilton Optimum Training gym at Ackergill ndash says his motivation is clear.\"One moment of my pain could be a letime of happiness for somebody ,\" he says.\"Im effectively taking the role of the reindeer by pulling this sleigh ndash theyve got time off ahead of their main job on Christmas Eve ndash but its worth the effort.\"He stresses that at least hes got a sturdy sleigh to haul his good this year.\"The first year I did this I went from Thurso to Wick pulling a Tesco trolley full of goodies,\" he said.\"That was quite something as trolleys can be tricky to control in the shop let alone on the road.\"He underlined that the episode served as a good advertisement for Tesco, as it showed how strong its trolleys are.\"We average around  hampers ndash although were aiming for  ndash and were appealing for people to gather and donate as much food, drink and clothing as possible, as it can really light up someone less fortunates Christmas.\"If people are in a position to give, then they can donate what they can to myself at the gym in Ackergill.\"Kris is no stranger to fundraising as earlier this year he got down and dirty as he battled \"the Beast\".He added: \"The Beast Race is an annual km obstacle course race set around the banks of Loch Ness.\"The obstacles being mud, hills, marshes and climbing walls.

It has been a gradual build-up over the years but I think the way the Highland Council has been dealing with issues has not helped and it has not helped any of you whatsoever.Mrs Manson promised a ldquolistening council when she took the reins from Steve Barron last month. That has included a y series of drop-ins across the sprawling Highland Council area inviting people to share what they feel the local authority does well and where therersquos room for improvement.The council faces a massive budget gap against a backdrop of simmering public discontent over areduction in services as belts are tightened.She said she was willing to look at all issues raised. She said: ldquoI need to think about how we structure staff in the council so that people feel there is an equal service out there.The planned introduction of parking charges to a town which boasts freely available space prompted warnings. Councillor Margaret Paterson said: ldquoI can tell you that the majority of people in Dingwall want you to stop imposing parking charges. And as a council you donrsquot care how the High Street will go down the plug hole because of it.Mrs Manson said she would consider the concerns raised during the drop-ins and would report back in January.What do YOU think  We welcome feedback.

What do my constituents, or at least the majority of them, feel I should do The atmosphere at Westminster has at times been what is best described as ‘febrile’. Much more experienced colleagues tell me they have known nothing like it.Since the start of the week, however, and three straight defeats for the Government, it’s probably been much more about mutual, cross-party team spirit and comparing notes.Team spirit may seem like an odd phrase to use about a place much more used to tribalism. But that is exactly what has been happening.I’ve had snatched conversations with colleagues from other parties, sharing our confidence that we might still be able to pause this economic disaster long enough to give the people the chance to have their say. A final say. A people’s vote.: Hard Brexit makes these people fear for their lives – Christine JardineBut, and I shall come back to this later, I have also spent hours reading the hundreds of emails, letters and postcards that I’ve been sent by constituents eager for me to know their views.I appreciate that many of you will be worried that a referendum on the deal could create yet more isiveness. But, at this point, with parliament in gridlock and no majority for any deal, going back to the people might just be the best option. By far.Our five days of debate in the Commons have, so far, been long, tiring and, at times surprising. There is no cohesion on the Government benches.A Tory rising to their feet is as likely to be criticising their own party for either falling short on delivering Brexit or for ignoring the national interest as they are to be attacking the opposition. Even the Cabinet is unpredictable.And for each of us inidually, there is the thought that this is a decision we cannot afford to get wrong. The country cannot afford for us to get it wrong.Which brings me back to the correspondence I have had from my constituents.I take the privilege of representing the people of Edinburgh West more seriously than any role I have ever had, outside parenting.And for me that has meant taking every opportunity to check that their views have not changed since the referendum on  June, .On that night, I left the count at Meadowbank with the figures ringing in my ears. More than  per cent of the voters in Edinburgh wanted to stay in the European Union. The support in Edinburgh West was among the highest in the country.: Refugees like young Alan Kurdi are still dying in the Med – Christine JardineNow,  months later, I have little reason to doubt the solidarity of that opinion.Out canvassing, I have listened carefully to what both myself and my colleagues have been told on the doorsteps.I have kept a careful log of what those who have written to me have had to say.I also have my own reasons, of course, for thinking our national interest is not well served by the current proposals.I do not think this, or any deal, can deliver the continued economic stability we have in the European Union. Our industries and businesses need an end to the uncertainty.Even the Chancellor Philip Hammond said recently that we will not be as well off economically outside of the EU.I have also argued consistently that the people should have the final say and that is now, I believe, even more pertinent.The issue of Northern Ireland, the problems created for a still-fragile peace process and the fact that the Government seems content to let them drt away from the UK in this agreement has also been a factor.And then there are my constituents. Their future and their views.Of the several hundred who have taken the time to share their views with me, more than  per cent want me to vote against this deal.That,you believe in representative democracy, is a strong argument.The people who elected me, to whom I will answer at the next election, do not like what this Government has presented as our future.If all the other arguments were put aside that would still be enough to persuade me of what I should do.So tomorrow night, I expect to go through the lobbies to vote down the proposals for our departure from the European Union.I shall hold fast to my promise last year to the people of Edinburgh West and keep faith with all of those who are looking now to Westminster to sort this mess and then give them the final say.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841538.1544428934!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith voting down may s brexit plan is about more than the backstop","story":"There is far more to worry about in the Prime Minister#s plans than just Northern Ireland, writes Brian MonteithIt does look likely that the vote on the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement will go ahead tomorrow and will be heavily defeated.There is a large exercise in expectation management emanating from Downing Street, with the possible scale of a defeat being talked up so thatit happens to be less than a hundred it can then be portrayed as not as bad as it might have been and this will justy Theresa May carrying on to try and get some concessions from the EU.This behaviour should not be acceptable to anyone who supports democracy.The Withdrawal Agreement is completely and utterly owned by Theresa May. She has told everyone it is her deal or no deal – or even no Brexit. She has sought to rely on the votes of Labour MPs – providing briefings for key Labour MPs ahead of those from her own party. Accordingly the deal has undergone close detailed scrutiny and been found wanting. Some of the legal advice that the Government then chose to ignore has exposed the deal’s real weaknesses – which, crucially, are far more than the Irish Protocol known as the backstop.Of real concern must also be the failure of Theresa May’s government to show that it has made a serious effort to prepare for No Deal. Those two counts – losing a vote over her flagship policy and leaving the country ill-prepared to face an economic risk – are capital offences that would normally warrant removal from office. It should be remembered that in  the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain actually won a vote of confidence following the failure of the Norwegian campaign yet he knew he no longer had moral or political authority and resigned with dignity. Theresa May must also resign to maintain any degree of political respect, andshe does not she should be subject to a vote of confidence within her parliamentary party, for that is the only way to replace her with someone who can get down to the task of preparing the country for leaving without a deal while trying to get the EU to compromise.A vote of no confidence put forward by Labour would most likely fail, as the DUP would not wish to bring down the governing party in favour of Jeremy Corbyn – and recalcitrant Tory MPs would also fall into line rather than be responsible for the fall of the government and the calling of an early general election. So it must be down to backbenchers to submit their letters to trigger the Conservative Party’s own procedures. At that point I would expect the likes of Jeremy Hunt and Savid Javid to tell the Prime Minister it was time to step aside or face humiliation from her own colleagues.There is much talk for May being given one last chance in Brussels this week and thatshe can get a time limit on the Irish Protocol or other such fix that allows the UK to claim a minor victory then her deal could then pass. This would be a foolish and dangerous approach, for even without the backstop the deal is not Brexit. It would still tie the UK into many Single Market rules overseen by the European Courts of Justice and throw away £ billion for nothing in . Countries like South Korea and Canada make no contribution to access the EU’s markets and the House of Lords found there was no obligation to pay the EU £bn.A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure to meet, Simon Boyd, the Scottish CEO of Reid Steel. Simon, who served his apprenticeship in a Clyde shipyard, explained to me how the company he runs, which exports to some  countries around the world, was originally established in France in  – but is now located in Dorset. Yet despite this pedigree and the existence of the so-called Single Market he finds it easier to export steel to Mongolia than he does to France. He gave me two examples of why the first was when his company had a UK Government contract to build storage facilities at Calais, and the second was for a £.M aircraft hangar in Toulouse – but Reid Steel could not do either because it is not a French company. In France only French companies can buy the insurances needed to work in their country. Those insurances also require that all materials have been approved by the French testing authorities, making it more dficult for UK manufactured goods.Far from creating a level playing field like the single market Scotland enjoys across the whole of the United Kingdom, the EU has rigged the game rampant protectionism is the only winner – and this state of affairs is what the Withdrawal Agreement seeks to maintain.Boyd also explained to me how the EU’s Eurocodes system for design unormity ensures each dferent country, and in some cases dferent regions, have their own local ‘annexes’ or conditions. Often they are in native languages and are simply a means to tie up competition in a tangle of prohibitive and costly red tape. Businesses have to purchase Eurocodes from the British Standards Institute, which is a signicant overhead and can be a barrier to entry for many SMEs. To purchase just one part of the Eurocodes for Reid Steel’s type of work costs circa £,, and that is for just one of the  parts of the codes that relate to their industry. For an SME like Reid Steel these overheads are burdensome,not completely unaffordable.As a further example Boyd told me of how Reid Steel designed and helped build  structures in the Caribbean, all designed to British Standards . Every single one stood up to the category five hurricanes last year. Boyd doubted Reid Steel would have been able to win that work using Eurocodes as the use of Eurocodes internationally is rare.The UK needs to be free from the EU’s bureaucratic restraints of the Single Market, Customs Union and the jurisdiction of the ECJcompanies like Reid Steel are to maintain their global reach and grow. The Withdrawal Agreement is a bad deal – with or without the Backstop – and on Tuesday MPs need to take the brave pills and defeat it to ensure a real Brexit can be delivered by setting up the chance for a better deal.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841080.1544204453!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment mps face a test of common sense on brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...In the foreign country of early , those campaigning in favour of the United Kingdom#s departure from the European Union spoke confidently about how painless the process would be. There was no downside to Brexit, they said, only idend after idend.Along with outlandish claims about funding for the NHS, and simplistic slogans about “taking back control”, Brexiteers insisted the UK’s former partners in the EU would bend over backwards to agree a deal that was good for Britain. Two and a half years after the UK voted by a small margin in favour of Brexit, the words of Eurosceptic campaigners ring hollow.The EU, unsurprisingly, has put the interests of its remaining members before those of the UK during y and often fractious negotiations.Every step of the way, as Prime Minister Theresa May has tried to reach a workable agreement with the EU, pro-Brexit campaigners have complained they are not getting what they want. Ask them precisely what that is, however, and they revert to their default setting of talking about sovereigntyand insist thatonly the Prime Minister was bolder, she would have achieved something better.Such is the degree of unhappiness with her draft agreement among MPs - on both sides of the EU debate - that the Prime Minister looks likely to lose the Commons vote on it tomorrow.In normal circumstances, such a defeat would be career-ending. Mrs May assumed power in  pledging to deliver a Brexit that worked for all. She has, it is clear, failed in that task.Boris Johnson has said the Prime Minister could hold on to her job after defeat tomorrow but would have toto Brussels to negotiate a better deal. With precisely the degree of respect due to Mr Johnson, we are bound to say that is nonsensical. The idea that EU leaders will now bend signicantly further to accommodate have-cake-and-eat-it Leavers like Mr Johnson is preposterous.The priority now - for all MPs - must be to avoid a No-Deal Brexit, which represents the worst possible outcome. Whether the quiet pragmatism and level-headedness required to avoid this scenario exists in sufficient supply in the House of Commons remains to be seen. We fear common sense may yet lose the day.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841571.1544428298!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch norway plus is not an option for the uk s brexit","story":"Amber Rudd and her colleagues are deluding themselves with their Brexit plan B, writes Lesley RiddochScots stand today, surveying the collapse of British governance, like folk on leboats watching the mighty Titanic start to slip beneath the waves.Most of us do not vote Conservative and never will.Most of us do not vote Conservative and never will. Most of us voted to Remain in the EU in . And now most of us would opt for independence in the EUa self-harming Brexit goes ahead. And no matter which withdrawal deal is advocated by desperate members of both main political parties south of the Border, each one is more damaging than simply staying in the EU. That includes Amber Rudd’s crazy, last gasp advocacy of “Norway-plus” as a Brexit option,or really when Theresa May’s dead duck is finally allowed to waddle off the stage. Of course, on the face of it, Norway-plus looks inviting. The UK was one of the founding members of the European Free Trade Associationin . Britain left to join the EEC in , so EFTA membership could be portrayed as ato the fold we should never have left. Rejoining EFTA would let the UK remain inside the European single market by also gaining eligibility to join the European Economic Areaand that would guarantee genuinely frictionless trade.Britain would leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the common agricultural and fisheries policies and be free of the drive towards “ever closer union” from the end of . And the “plus” bit – remaining in a temporary customs union – would allow goods to join services enjoying business asnormal instead of the impending chaos of a no-deal Brexit.But the price is high, especially for a party which consciously decided to follow the irresponsible and malicious path of blaming Brussels, EU nationals and immigrants for the Dickensian levels of poverty, inequality, starvation, collapse of public services and general hopelessness created by their own policies in Britain. There is therefore no way the Tories can sell a Norway-plus deal which accepts freedom of movement and “rule-taking” from Brussels while paying - per cent of full membership fees to feverishly Brexit-ready English voters. Of course, there’s another tiny problem with the Norway-plus option. Norway will block it.Last week, Heidi Nordby Lunde, Conservative MP and president of Norway’s European Movement, kicked British membership of the EFTA roundly into touch, telling Channel : “I’m sceptic to letting the UK into the EFTA family because it’s kind of like having an abusive partner spiking the drinks and inviting them to the Christmas party.”When askedshe felt that the potential of Britain joining the EFTA would upset the balance in that group, she added: “I think you would mess it all up for us, the way you have messed it up for yourselves.”This kind of reality check has so far been completely missing from Britain’s pie-in-the-sky Brexit debate and is all the more signicant because Norwegians are usually the world’s most diplomatic people – the product of compromise and consensus that comes from almost a century using PR in elections.But Lunde summed up Britain’s Norway-plus problems succinctly: “The Norway deal has four issues that I don’t think UK politicians want. First of all, we accept migration internally in the EU, we also accept rulings by the European Court of Justice, we accept the rules and regulations that we get from the EU. Also, being in the EFTA bloc, we can’t make our own free trade agreements without having Liechtenstein and Iceland with us.”Interestingly, none of these obstacles for “red line” Britain would create an insuperable barrier to an independent Scotland which wanted to pursue the EFTA EEA routeEFTA members and Scots decided that was preferable to full EU membership. But after this one short interview on Friday, Norway-plus stood roundly demolished as an option for Britain. Yet, unbelievably, the very next day, flying in the face of all that had just been said, Rudd became the first Cabinet minister to publicly back the Norway-plus modelMay’s Brexit deal is defeated in the Commons tomorrow. Even more incredibly, Rudd’s desperate advocacy of this non-viable Norway deal propelled the Work and Pensions Secretary back up the pollsters’ rankings in the race to become the next Tory leader. Mind you, since the attempt to keep legal advice from MPs also shunted Attorney General Geoffrey Cox into the running, why should anyone be surprised  Despite defeat in the Commons, Tory MPs and London-based political commentators were apparently moved and impressed by the gravelly, authoritative quality of his voice. These are the depths to which “leadership” in British politics has sunk.In short, a proposal that was comprehensively trashed only  hours earlier by a Norwegian Conservative politician has earned the deluded or deliberately obfuscating Rudd an even greater chance of taking over when May has gone.If folk believe this bourach can still be described as governance, they must be part of the minority – according to weekend surveys of Scottish public opinion – that still prefers Brexit in the UK to Scottish independence in Europe. You don’t have to be a card-carrying Christian for a verse of Matthew to come to mind: “Beware of  prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will know them.”Well, now all Scots know how the Conservative Party and the British Government choose to operate. They are always focused on the short term, always seeking one-off deals instead of long-term relationships, always feathering their own nests – recent European investments by leading Brexiteers haven’t escaped public attention – and always suspicious or careless of neighbours’ interests. It’ll be a very long time before the Irish forget Priti Patel’s appalling suggestion that the prospect of food shortages should be used to scare Irish people into submission over the backstop. Of course, Scots are not immune from Brexit or its ill effects.But looked at from the perspective of those boarding the leboat north of the Border today, there’s only one question left as Britain embarks on its final act of jaw-dropping self-harm.

The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh #  she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8726164.1543838961!/image/image.jpg","title":"five fun festive events for the whole family this christmas","story":"With so much to see and do this festive season, it can be hard to decide what to prioritise.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"suzanne breen unionists united in opposition as remainers rally around backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"well be doing northern ireland a big favour by voting may deal down claims dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Eventhose rules hurt NI businesses they will still automatically apply.\"The DUPs outspoken Brexit spokesman had previously caused a rt with business leaders in favour of the withdrawal agreement when he referred to them as NIO \"puppets\".He adds: \"I will have no dficulty in ignoring the siren voices raised in support of this rotten agreement when the vote is taken in Parliament. In doing so I will be doing the unionist cause and the business community in NI a massive favour.\"The DUP is sticking to its pledge to oppose Mrs Mays Brexit proposals when it comes to the vote in the House of Commons tomorrow.The partys position piles more pressure on the Prime Minister to amend or abandon her Brexit deal, which has attracted heavy criticism not only from her political opponents, but also from many within her own party.Yesterday Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay insisted that the vote would still go ahead tomorrow amid speculation Mrs May might be forced to delay it in a last-ditch effort to avoid a humiliating defeat.The Prime Minister warned Tory would-be rebels the country would be in \"uncharted waters\"the deal was rejected.\"It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal,\" she told the Mail on Sunday. \"We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country.\"As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.\"Reports suggested Mrs May could make an emergency trip to Brussels ahead of a planned summit on Thursday in an effort to secure further concessions in a bid to win over critics of her plan.The Prime Minister spoke to European Council president Donald Tusk yesterday, although Downing Street insisted it was a routine call ahead of the summit.He said it would be a \"an important week for the fate of Brexit\".Tory MP Will Quince quit as a ministerial aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, while the Sundayreported that another parliamentary private secretary was on the verge of quitting, and Cabinet Brexiteer Penny Mordaunt was considering whether to back the deal or resign.She has not backed Mrs Mays deal yet, but has said she supports the Prime Minister.Meanwhile, Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood said he would back the deal - but indicated that unless it was passed quickly he might support a second referendum because the original decision to leave may \"no longer represent a reflection of current intent\".Other ministers - including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd - have suggested that a Norway-plus deal keeping the UK in the single market and a customs union could be a \"plausible\" alternativeMrs Mays plan is rejected.Any defeat would lead to fresh questions about Mrs Mays political future.Former Work and Pensions secretary Esther McVey said she would give the prospect of standing as leader serious consideration, and suggested that Brexiteers should unite around a single candidate.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News Sophy Ridge On Sunday: \"Ive always said I wouldnt rule it out, but it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in all that speculation when weve got such a big issue up for decision on Tuesday.\"Meanwhile, a Brexit betrayal march led by right-wing activist Tommy Robinson was \"vastly\" outnumbered by counter-demonstrators, opposition organisers said. The English Defence League founder turned-Ukip adviser marched with supporters through London yesterday before addressing a rally beside Parliament Square.Scotland Yard placed restrictions on the march as well as on a counter-demonstration organised by Labour supporters and anti-fascists. Labour grassroots group Momentum said about , turned up to oppose the march, claiming opponents \"vastly\" outnumbered the Ukip-led demonstrators nearly five to one.Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party executive met in Belfast on Saturday, where it unanimously agreed that the withdrawal agreement should be rejected.Party leader Robin Swann MLA said: \"We want a deal, the country wants a deal, but not a deal where the ransom to pay is the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\"Its time to go back to the negotiating table.\""},{"url":null,"title":"university of ulster graduations monday december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The castle was transferred to the Northern Ireland Government in  for preservation.The new roof will be in keeping with the late-medieval architecture of the historic building and will replace the existing flat one, which has been in place for the past  years. It will be made from Irish oak, and oak-pegged without the use of nails or metal fixings.The roof will be a series of open trusses and rafters carrying oak boards. Externally, it will be finished in Cumbrian stone slates and lead. The outside appearance of the castle will not look signicantly dferent from ground level, as the roof will be behind the battlements.However, internally the Great Hall at the top of the tower will be transformed into a higher, brighter and more historically resonant space. The castle keep will also be warmer and drier, allowing the full use of the space for historic artefacts, displays and s.The work, to be carried out by JPM Contracts Ltd of Dungiven, starts this month and is expected to last approximately six months. Colum McNicholl from JPM Contracts Ltd said: \"The new roof, which draws from medieval architecture, will be a showpiece of good conservation, practice and skills. The work, involving stonemasons, carpentry and lead workers, will ensure the integrity of the keep for generations to come.\"The project will be managed by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division. Director Iain Greenway said: \"The works, which are now moving into the construction phase, will safeguard and enhance this internationally important castle and ensure that heritage delivers for the social and economic prosperity of the whole area.\""},{"url":null,"title":"jonathan rea recognised by ulster university with honorary degree","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If youre not getting any support,youre struggling, then the church should be there as a place of refuge and hope.\"With HIV theres a nosiness to it. The first thing that people want to know is how you got it and theres a real sense that its a moral disease, which needs to be taken away, and that stigma and discrimination people feel because of that needs to be taken away. \"The church should be the first people to do that. We need to stand up for those who are marginalised and those who will find no support anywhere . The local church can provide something that no other organisation can.\"While Rev Frazer admitted his words may not sit comfortably with some within the Presbyterian Church, he maintained the time has come to start rebuilding trust. He said: \"I know my comments will sound very hollow to some and again that is one of the reasons why I have to speak out. \"I think a lot of trust has been broken. A lot of people will not like the fact that Im speaking out, both from my own church and wider afield, butwe dont try to reform those bridges then theres no hope. \"What are we being called to do then  \"Until we actually show that in practice that we can be that place of refuge and hope, then we cant do anything. \"Its up to us to take that extra step. I know I cant force people into coming to church. I cant force people into believing anything that I believe, but when we take that step towards each other thats when the trust can be rebuilt.\"In the past  years, membership of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland has fallen by ,. The figures, outlined in the  Presbyterian Blue Book, show that in  the Church had , members. Last year, the total had fallen to ,.Rev Frazer said: \"In society there are many myths and misunderstandings that are unfair and unhelpful, but I think our church in a hierarchy sees all with compassion and love and seeks to show that. \"We might get some of the decisions wrong when we look historically at them. \"In hindsight we might not have carried out many things in the proper way, but I think we look at all with compassion and love and empathy and with a sense of belonging. We may not show it very well at times, but we do.\"This years vote on same-sex relationships was passed by a majority, but not all, of the Presbyterian Church. Thats important for people to remember. \"There was a lot of debate, sincere people on both sides who felt they were upholding their biblical principles. But I think you can say we got distracted by our doctrines. We forgot about people. In the church were not called to think about doctrine, were called to think about people.\"We have many people in our church who have struggled with that vote, who have contemplated leaving the Presbyterian Church and my church, but Jesus doesnt call the church at large, He calls us as iniduals and as iniduals we have to ask how can we make someone whos living with HIV feel like they belong \"This isnt an attempt to kick up a bit of dust and make a point about wider Presbyterianism. Its about keeping a focus on the support the church can be there to offer.\"There is positive support there for people and I want to see that acknowledged. The church seems to have lost that part of its voice.\"There are a lot of issues out there which we as a church can have a positive impact on. \"We need to shine a brighter light on the Presbyterian Church, be the leader of society which we have been in the past and get back to being seen as a place of compassion.\""},{"url":null,"title":"progress on transforming northern irelands peace walls slowed by lack of government","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Johnston said residents are now ready to make further progress but cant due to the political stasis.Dr Johnston said political leadership, a strategy and the guarantee of an aftercare package to reassure communities are needed. He blamed the lack of political leadership for helping paramilitary organisations target young people.He also said the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit had caused insecurity around political identity among border communities in Ireland.On Monday, the IFI announced its latest funding package, pledging £.m for  projects across Ireland which seek to deliver positive change.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"motorway chargepoint ban urged for hybrid cars","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Battery-only cars have no combustion engine, while plug-in hybrids can operate in full electric mode, using conventional fuel or a combination of both.

Mr Raab served as Brexit secretary for four and a half months, taking over David Davis, before resigning last month in protest at the deal reached between Theresa Mays Government and Brussels. \"You would hear swirling around in Brussels - particularly the people around Selmayr, Martin Selmayr in the Commission, and some others - that losing Northern Ireland was the price the UK would pay for Brexit,\" said Mr Raab. \"This was reported to me through the diplomatic channel. \"It is one thing to defend your interests robustly, but there is another thing in the spirit of so-called European unity to be trying to carve up a major European nation. \"And it is deeply recklessyou look at the Europeans own interests… look at Catalonia, look at the seperatist tendancies across Europe.

Full preliminary results are expected on Monday.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Pashinian Pashinian has blasted members of the old elite Mr Pashinian exuded confidence after casting his ballot in Yerevan, saying that he was sure that his party would win a majority in parliament.During the month-long campaign, Mr Pashinian has blasted members of the old elite as corrupt, and pledged to revive the economy, create new jobs and encourage more Armenians tohome.“An economic revolution is our top priority,” Mr Pashinian told reporters Sunday.Armenia has suffered from an economic blockade stemming from the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan that has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a six-year separatist war in .Attempts to negotiate a peace settlement have stalled and fighting has occasionally flared up between ethnic Armenian forces and Azerbaijan’s soldiers.Both Azerbaijan and Turkey have closed their borders with Armenia over the conflict, cutting trade and leaving Armenia in semi-isolation. The country has direct land access only to Georgia and Iran.About one-third of Armenia’s population has moved to live and work abroad and remittances from those who have left account for around % of the country’s annual GDP.After seven months on the job, Mr Pashinian has remained widely popular, particularly among the young.“Pashinian has put fresh blood in our veins. I believe in the future of Armenia,” said computer expert Grigor Meliksetian, .Others were not so optimistic.Bella Nazarian, an entrepreneur, said Mr Pashinian has skilfully manipulated public hopes.“He’s a populist and a liar,” she said. “I believe that people’s eyes will open as early as the coming spring.”Mr Pashinian was the driving force behind the protests that erupted in April when Serzh Sargsyan, who had served as Armenia’s president for a decade, moved into the prime minister’s seat, a move seen by critics as an attempt to hold on to power.Thousands of protesters led by Mr Pashinian thronged the Armenian capital, and Mr Sargsyan resigned after only six days in the job."},{"url":null,"title":"review festive fun everglades santa sunday buffet lunch","story":"A trip to see Santa is a traditional part of the run up to Christmas, but after queuing for a five minute audience with the big man you start questioningit is really worth it.This year my family bypassed all that at the ‘Santa Sunday Buffet Lunch’ at the Everglades Hotel, which is a much of a treat for the mammies and daddies as it is for the kids.Like half of Derry, my two are dosed with the cold but I wasn’t for missing this so I got out the Calpol and the Tixylix and put them in their Sunday best.We swept into the hotel lobby in a cloud of Vicks Vaporub where we were greeted by a stunning Christmas tree, a Santa’s sleigh and a six foot polar bear.All thoughts of chesty coughs were quickly forgotten as we were handed a glass of mulled wineand an alcohol free hot cider .We were shown to our table and given the low down on the five course feast that awaited us.The children’s attention was where though because Santa was doing the rounds, stopping at every table for a photo and a chat.He reassured our daughter that she was on the nice list and her LOL Doll would be under the tree on Christmas morning.And he told our son that the elves could definitely rustle up a few carshe kept up the good behaviour.As you would expect from The Everglades the food was top notch, but for me it was the service that really stood out.Nothing was too much bother and everything was done with grace and ease.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshJust when I thought things couldn’t get any more relaxed and festive the Allegri Choir took to the stage and serenaded us with Christmas classics.Much as the kids enjoyed their meal, the dessert was definitely their highlight with a ‘pick ‘n’ mix’ trolley, popcorn machine, and shelves heaving with gateaux.After this we had a second audience with Santa who took lots of time to chat with the children and pose for photos before giving them a selection box, which I’m ‘looking after’ for them.Children’s entertainment is also laid on with Lego, arts and crafts, toys and computer games all over seen by lovely team who also do face painting and balloon modelling.The lady in charge even took time out to recommend some remedies for children’s hacking coughs that had made a reappearance.RelaxAll that was left for us to do was relax with a coffee while the children played with their new found friends.Professional photographs are also available in reception starting at a very reasonable £.‘Santa’s Sunday Buffet Lunch’ is served from . -

Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery.

I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event.

He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation.

Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one. If they do not have a decoration, we can make one for them.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those. Over the past two years, ours was one of the community festivals that had been unsuccessful in securing council funding.Mr Casey added: ldquoAs we approach our th anniversary, it would be a boostwe knew we had funding in good time, allowing our festival to be included in tourism brochures next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8792047.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"sparkle with black friday savings on jewellery and watches","story":"*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Theresa Mays deal delivers on the Brexit referendum result, says Karen BradleyThis government has an overriding duty, not just to deliver on the referendum result, but also to do so in ways that keep our United Kingdom united.The deal achieved by the prime minister is the only one on the table that can do that. Northern Ireland’s constitutional status within the United Kingdom is fully protected, whilst its unique history and geography are respected.It is an unprecedented and ambitious relationship which will protect jobs, communities and livelihoods across Northern Ireland, and the UK as a whole.I am proud to serve in a government that will never be neutral in its support of our precious Union and for Northern Ireland’s integral place within it, based on the consent principle as set out in the Belfast Agreement. We believe firmly that the best future for Northern Ireland lies within a stronger United Kingdom.Our ambition is to build a modern, dynamic, outward-looking Northern Ireland that works for everyone, regardless of their background. It is a Northern Ireland in which politics works, the economy grows and society is stronger. I believe this approach is in the best traditions of positive and constructive unionism.The deal we have reached with the EU helps us to achieve this. It avoids a hard border with Ireland and prevents a customs border in the Irish Sea, therefore allowing the people of Northern Ireland to continue living their lives as they do now. Crucially it will ensure that Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, will continue to benefit from the stability, security and prosperity that comes with being part of the world’s fth largest economy.I know from speaking to businesses, homeowners and consumers across Northern Ireland, that people just want us to get on with the job. Northern Ireland’s business community, in particular, has been very supportive of the deal. Over % of Manufacturing NI members back this deal, as do other business and farming representative bodies like the Federation of Small Business, the Institute of Directors and the Ulster Farmers’ Union.Leaving without an agreement in place, or an implementation period through which to adjust to our new relationship, would cause acute uncertainty for businesses, citizens, and consumers alike. This would pose unique challenges for Northern Ireland in particular.Strengthening Northern Ireland’s economy was an important idend of the political settlement of the Belfast Agreement – all of us have a duty to safeguard those gains in how we deliver on the Brexit vote.The prime minister believes passionately, as do I, that our country is stronger and better together. She has fought hard to preserve the bonds between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Like her, I am convinced that our best days lie ahead of us.As we face the challenges and reap the opportunities of Brexit, it is essential that we do so as one nation in a way that preserves prosperity in all parts of the UK. This deal achieves exactly that. It is not perfect, but that is the nature of a long and complex negotiation process. It is, however, the only solution on the table that delivers on the referendum, acknowledges Northern Ireland’s unique position, and delivers a stronger, fairer and more prosperous United Kingdom.UUP demands that Prime Minister goes back to negotiating table on BrexitTory chair visits Belfast, where he insists Irish border backstop is only temporary Brexit measure Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolO compensation package revealed          ..

There were a few others I knew who sung in dferent groups.”Stephanie, who is originally from Donegal but has been living in Belfast for more than  years since studying at the University of Ulster at Jordanstown, is a member of the Feile Women’s Singing Group.Through that group she met Clare Galway whom she enlisted to conduct the NI Water choir.Stephanie, , said: “I’ve always enjoyed singing. I don’t particularly enjoy singing on my own but I love singing in groups where you’re not as exposed. “It’s a bit more fun when you’re in a gang as well.“I would have sung in church and dabbled in bands when I was a teenager.”Stephanie is employed by NI Water as head of Waste Water: “On a daily basis I lead a team of around  people, the team includes a lot of men who are out and about on the ground. “I’m responsible for providing waste water services across the whole of Northern Ireland which contributes to protecting the natural environment by making sure that whatever waste water we receive is treated appropriately.”Protest camp considered as battle to save historic bridge gathers paceUUP demands that Prime Minister goes back to negotiating table on Brexit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She added: “I’ve been in that post for two years but I’ve been with NI Water for almost  years now since .”Practice for the NI Water choir takes place for two hours once a fortnight during an extended lunch break.Stephanie said: “Staff are entitled to an hour’s lunch break, the other hour is made up. Obviously work takes priority so we don’t expect every choir member to make every practice.“Work comes first, the choir fits in around that. Particularly in my job we can have flooding incidents, things that can kick off at little notice.“The choir has around  to  members depending on work and family commitments.“We don’t ask people to audition, practice is flexible, we want to make it as inclusive as possible.”The choir took part in its first competition at Holywood Music Festival, hitting the high notes and coming away with two awards. The choir delighted the judges with their flowing renditions of ‘Build Me Up Buttercup’, ‘Don’t Stop’ and John Lennon’s ‘Imagine.’Holywood Music Festival adjudicators described the ensemble as “a most committed choir who sing with conviction and enthusiasm and love of their art”.Stephanie said: “Holywood was our first competition. We have sung on a number of occasions for our colleagues, but this was the first time we’d veered into the outside world.“We’d taken part in a documentary with BBC Radio Ulster on workplace choirs.“After that we decided to try singing in a more formal setting to see how we would get on.“The choir worked hard under the direction of Clare to learn the pieces for the festival and there were definitely a few laughs along the way.“Many of the members have limited experience of performing in this environment so the judges’ positive feedback and the comments from others made the whole experience a very memorable one.”Askedthey had considered performing any water-related songs such as ‘Waterfall’ by the Stone Roses or Enya’s ‘Orinoco Flow’, Stephanie said: “We would make suggestions for songs but Clare would guide us with her knowledge and understanding of our strength and weaknesses.“We haven’t thought of doing any water-based songs but it’s maybe something we’ll look at in the future.“The songs we’ve done are all very familiar songs that we give a little twist to.”Claire, who is married with two teenage children, said: “In terms of the workplace the big drive for our executive committee is safety and wellbeing. There’s been a lot of publicity around the scientic benefits of singing in a choir and what that can bring to people.“We’re doing an event in work at Christmas where people can come along and get a tea and bun and listen to us singing. It’s not just the choir that get the buzz, it’s our colleagues as well.”try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolO compensation package revealed          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters. Itrsquos no use putting more on the roads without removing some of the current commuting traffic, he said.ldquoDespite all the talk of rail and tram improvements there isnrsquot any scope to increase the minimal park-and-ride facilities at Eastbrook and none at all at Dinas Powys.After the Public Consultation, the WelTAG Draft Stage  Report will go to the Vale Cabinet.Members will probably ask their Scrutiny Committee for Environment and Regeneration to give their opinion.The Steering Group is also seeking to engage Ken Skates AM, Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport in talks that could involve private sector developments to help fund a by-pass.But theyrsquove been put on hold awaiting the Stage  report. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.
